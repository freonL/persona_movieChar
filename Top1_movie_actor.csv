warrior,BRENDAN,Joel Edgerton," Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess. It's her birthday. I'm on it. Where's the rest of that skirt? Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay? I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some action. Promises, promises. Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in this too, OK? Listen up. So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs-- Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead. There we go. Alright Tito, well done. Remind not to mess with you. Sit down everybody. Dial it down. So, have we got it? Alright. The third law--  The dude? The dude has three. Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. For example, if KC does not stop the action of sending texts in class... ...and tell her posse outside to beat it... ...then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office. Thus setting our world back in proper balance. Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week. Brendan. I teach Physics. You said that three times already. I get that. But I'm asking you if there's something else you can do. Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure-- Because you advised us to do that. We had that conversation. I was paying medical bills. Is that in your file? Heart. So my option is I've got no options? You're not even gonna try to help me? 90 days is not enough. My wife and I have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. So, what do you suggest? That's not how I do things. Listen kiddo, I need you put Mommy back on, OK? I love you.  Hey. I'm just pulling in. Huh? Oh, they've got this open mic night thing. Should be a quiet one. Sleep well. You too. Bye. I'm not bouncing at a club. I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing. They're putting us out of the house in three months, we're running out OF OPTIONS-- We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going BACKWARDS Take your seats. Now, please. C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks. I need the money, Joe. Actually, I used to be one of those animals. I fought for a living.  Guess I forgot to put that down on my application. Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just-- It was the parking lot of a strip club. What are we gonna do?  The girls have an important piano recital in the morning. Got an equipment malfunction.  How'd it go? How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney? That was nice. Next semester? Look, Tess. They have these smoker fights all over. There's one in Lancaster next week. There's two in Dover the week after. Wilmington. Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us afloat. Some of them pay a little more than that.  I would have had to bounce for a month to make what I made in two hours last night. And these guys, they're not real fighters. They're just guys who have seen too much UFC on TV. If you have a better solution, I'm all ears. It'll be fine. I'll just leave the house as usual, except now I'll be going to the gym. Liking the place, Frank. Amazing, man. Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie. It's alright. It's all good. She's good now. Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually. I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.  I was hoping you'd train me. I want to get back in the cage. I just won an event the other night. Ish. I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue. The parking lot thing kinda got me suspended. I need to keep working the smokers. No. I was unconscious. It's not gonna happen. Come on. Whattya say, Frank? That's all I need. I appreciate it.  Well, I'm just gonna go get my stuff from the car. What're you doing here? Something wrong with your hands? If there's nothing wrong with your hands then there's no reason for you not to phone. That's the deal. Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable. I'm going inside. Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything. You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I do. You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is. Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that? That shit you pulled. Never again. And all the shit I saw growing up? That doesn't happen here. Take care of yourself. Tommy's in Pittsburgh? He came to see you? You and Tommy are training together? Tommy Conlon. I know what her name is. I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days? Did he say if he wants to see me? Wow, look at you. Mister inside man. You and Tommy training together like nothing ever happened. This is unbelievable. Now I know what you're really doing here. You came to gloat. Well, there you go. You got your son back. You got your son back. You know, part of the reason I stuck around was `cause I thought I'd finally get you all to myself. But you didn't have any interest in training me. Tommy was the one. Forget it. You were always a front runner. You never had any interest in underdogs. But I was your son. Am I? Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I do not trust you. Tell Tommy this is where I am if he wants to see me. Goodnight, Pop. Just some nice old man. You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite? Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me? It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do. They'll have to kill me to get me out of that cage. Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you. That's not gonna happen.  It's not gonna happen. I love my coach! Hey Frank.  That's unbelievable. I can't thank you enough. I don't know what to say. Alright, listen, I've gotta call you back. Alright, bye. I'm in. I'm going. It's a lot of money, Tess. You don't think I can do it. I'm not gonna get killed. Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise? So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd really love it if you'd be with me on this. Been looking all over for you. How's it going? I was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee. You don't want to go sit down somewhere? Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to know I was never gonna see you guys again? She wasn't some girl. I married her. She's my wife.  That's Tess. And that's Emily and Rosie. They're your nieces, Tommy. I know you don't know them. Of course you don't know them. Because that's my family. I'm your brother, man. What? I wasn't in the Corps. Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old kid. What the hell did I know? She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it? I stay with Tess and I never get to see you guys again? Not a single phone call? Nothing? God, man, I don't understand this. You won't forgive me, but you'll forgive Pop? That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them. But I forgave Pop. Just like I forgave you and Mom. Yeah. I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do? You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make! I can do this. I'd doing this! I'm doing it! I'm gonna fight him. Where's Pop? Angle out, hit, and move. Tap, Tommy! Tap! I popped his shoulder. I heard it tear. Josh! Tommy! What are you doing? What are you that crazy? What are you doing? It's over! It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't have to do this. I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry! Tap, Tommy! Tap! I love you, Tommy! I love you!"

No.   No.   He hasn't lied...                            *  It was a trumpet!   Wasn't it?   Wasn't it a trumpet? No. I'm done.    Find another cab. Leave me alone.  I'm collateral anyway, so do it and                      * stop making me a part of this!                           * * I don't wanna know you!

She's in the hospital. Yeah.   What difference does it make? So? No. I can't take you to see my mother... Waste of money.   Won't mean a thing to her. Hi, Ma. I got caught up at work. * I brought you flowers. You're gonna cheer up.  See? * I didn't buy 'em. He did.                              * Mom, Vincent.   Vincent, my mother, Ida. Hey, mom. How many times do I have to ask you not to do that? Talk about me like...I'm...not...in the room, here. Mom, Vincent's not interested.  Let's go. I came to see you. I saw you.     You look fine. Let's go. You'd do her a favor. Bullshit. Jazz. Don't start. She hears what she wants to hear.    I don't disillusion her. Whatever   I tell her's never good                       * enough.    It's always been that way... My three   older brothers...their wives made 'em   move outta town. Where on Whittier? What's at El Rodeo? How do you know? Mothers are worse. What happened? Then what? I'm sorry. It's not bullshit. You gotta get cash together. Insurance, bond, maintenance, tires. Staff-up. Client lists. It's not get the car, put asses on seats. 'Cause Island Limos will be more than a ride...like a club experience, a cool groove you don't want to end. Like that. So it's gotta be perfect.                    * Perfect. Plus I got bills. She's been dying of the disease since I was in high school... Why? In case who searches? Felix?   Okay.    What's he look like? Who is he? I don't get it.  Why don't you go?                   * Why me? I can't. VINCENT They don't know what I look like. And                    * I don't meet people. Like in risk                        * management. Protect anonymity. And you're not going to screw that up. How'm I gonna be you? No. No. If...if I don't pull it off...? I can't do this. If I pull it off, it's gonna get other people killed... Uh, how long you been doin' this?                        * In case he asks. You get benefits? Uh, hi... I'm here to see Felix.      He has something for me. Uh. Say...say it's Vincent.          I'm Vincent. I'm Vincent... I lost my stuff. Yeah. Dedos? I'm sorry. No. No. I think... I think...  ...I think you should tell the man behind me to put that gun away.  I said. Tell him to put the gun away. Before I take it and beat his bitch                       * ass to death with it. I picked up a tail. You tell me. How do I know? So I tossed the list and work-ups to protect...in part...  ...your Hermes, Facconable sorry ass. You think I like comin' here? Like I got stupid all of an instant? Shit happens. You gotta roll with it. Darwin. I Ching... The fat man. The penthouse guy.      The jazz man. It leaves two. In six years, have I ever not? I never do. And as a token of appreciation...I want to offer you a discount. Yeah. All my services, here, tonight... Twenty-five percent off. Hell, make it fifty.  By the way. Daniel said he was sorry. ...I'm very impressed. Twelve minutes. Why? Who? I don't know. All I owe a fare is a ride, Vincent. Don't shoot! I'm not Vincent! I'm Max!   I'm a goddamn cab driver! Oh, man, am I happy to see you!     I don't believe it! I can't believe it.   I can't believe it...!  ...fuck off. You had to kill Fanning?! That cop!  Why'd you have to do that? You couldn't wound him? The guy had a family, maybe parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was a good guy, and he believed me... No, not just that. Yeah, so, what's wrong with that? Some living. What's downtown?  One more. Whyn't you kill me and find another cab. You're full of shit. 'Cause that's what you said... What'd they do? That's the reason? Then what are you? What's with you...?                                      * Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said: ""You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person across the street, there, what they think, who they are, how they feel, or I will kill you""...they'd have to kill you...wouldn't they...?  'Cause you don't have a clue...about...anyone.                                   *  ...I don't think you, you have a clue,                   * period. Did anyone ""do"" for you in your life...? Ever? When you draw breath in the morning? Open your eyes in the a.m.? You anticipate...anything? Want anything? Expect anything? I don't think so...  'Cause you are low, my brother, way low... and some standard parts that are supposed to be there?...with you, aren't. So what happened to you, man? What happened to you? Answer the question. None of your business. 'Cause I never straightened-up and looked at it, you know...?  ...myself, I should have. My brothers did...  Tried to gamble my way out from under. Another born-to-lose deal! Then, ""it's gotta be perfect to go!"" You know? Risk all torqued-down. But you know what? It doesn't matter. What's it matter, anyway? 'Cause we are...insignificant out here in this                         * big-ass nowhere. Twilight Zone shit.                         * Says the badass sociopath in my backseat. So that's one thing I got to thank you for, bro... Until now, I never saw it that way... ...not until now. So what's it all matter? It don't. Fuck it. Fix it. Nothing to lose. Right? Why? What are you gonna do? Pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot...my ass. Vincent? Go fuck yourself. Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?  I'm...fine. Fine. Just dizzy and                        * shit.                                                   * Huh? Sure. Arrest me. Take me in.    Police station. LA County's good. Get your hand off your gun! Look, someone's gonna get killed if I                    * don't, it's...                                           * NO!   I gotta go, see, you don't...                      * HEY, HEY! When did this become a negotiation? Cuff yourself to the goddamn door. Good! Do us a favor. Call the police! I'm going to 6th and Fig.                          * * I got no time to explain...                                * Fuck off!  C'mon, go through, go through...  Annie...it's Max. Max, the cab driver! Listen! Listen, okay? There's a man. His name's Vincent. He's come to kill you!  Kill you! He is coming to kill you! A guy, Felix, hired him! Or people Felix works for. He's already killed witnesses, now he's coming after you! He was scoping out your building when I dropped you off. I don't know what happened, but he got into my cab. It doesn't matter! Get out of the goddamn building... No, no, wait...! 93    OMIT                                                            93 ...he's two floors below you. Where are you, what floor? He doesn't know you're up there!    Stay right where you are! Call 911! Call the goddamn police!   Don't move from that spot...  Hang up. Hang up! Annie, get out! He knows where you are! Shit! Let her go. We're almost at the next station."
priest,PRIEST ,Paul Bettany," This time there was a little girl. I want to see the other Priests. Why? And their reasons for building more and more factories? The sky is turning black. You're my friend. I don't know what's happening to me. (7, Questions. Doubts. I'm not sure what it is. Koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to face. Who is it? Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, Monsignors. Even the Monsignors are uneasy'around Priest. Their leader, ORELAS, leans forward, addressing him. I come before you because I would like my authority to be reinstated. She's my blood, Monsignor. The proper authorities? But Monsignor...they are the enemy. Not so long that we should forget what they are capable of. No, Monsignor. ""Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven"" -- Yes, sir.' Yes, Monsignor. Why won't they listen to me? A beat. Koeppen takes another drink. You know I can't do that. Why? Then ...I go against God. In an eyeblink -- Priest strips the gun from the nearby officer, CRACKING it against the trooper's head, his attack graceful and precise -- a whirlwind of PINPOINTED BLOWS and SHATTERED BONES. When it's over, eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing. Everything goes quiet. Folds his hands into the prayer position. VOONI There's a POP OF AIR and --- oh my God...I am sorry for. having offended you. it was never my intention to do so... His words continue OVER I want so much to firmly resolve with the help of your grace to sin no more and to .avoid the near occasions of sin. All I can do is ask for forgiveness for what is yet to come... I now know the devil lives within me. The sins coming all too easy... Still on his bike, Priest's foot touches the ground, blocking our view as we CUT TO: And all too frequently. Priest REVS his bike, gunning out the doors. UNCONSCIOUS BODIES left in his wake. If I was a vampire you'd be dead already. The cross tattoo, a striking image. Hicks stares, pushing his hat back on his forehead. .Delicious I know. The pack headed in this direction. There's a reservation up that way so that's where I'll start. I'll find her. I need bullets. How many do you have? The clerk laughs... then realizes he's serious. I have this. He pulls out a sack of coins, it hits the counter with a solid THUD. The clerk smiles wider.. Sometimes things just happen. Fault's got nothing to do with it. I'm not so sure anymore. There's a KNOCK at the door. Aaron opens it slightly. It's Sheriff Hicks. Why? How you with a gun? I'll be there. Nothing more needing to be said, Hicks turns to walk out, stops at the door. We don't. Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven... As he continues THE CAMERA slowly moves OUT THE WINDOW and into the night, moving across HALBRIDGE. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. We see the TOWNSPEOPLE: lock their doors, bolting the shutters, tucking their children in safely for the night. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. And now the camera stops on a LARGE SHADOWY FIGURE perched on a nearby roofline. Yes. I prayed. Either way. We have two hours to get in and out. Sundown. Hicks looks up at the sky. The sun tilting towards the horizon. Familiars are illegal. We're not going to find anything out here...We have to get into the crypts. Where's the girl? No? Maybe your Master will know. Wh re is she? Your.Master'll be dead. He shoves the slab more, the light rays hanging just outside the edge. And now The Familiar begins to laugh, a horrible rattling sound. Something in his mood has shifted. Leaps in front. Blocking his way. Not yet. With a HORRIBLE SCREECH the Familiars attack, LAUNCHING at Priest and Hicks. Blades in the air. Now we can do this easy -- He tosses the BUTCHER KNIFE, it sticks in the ground a hairline from a Familiar's head. Or we can do this HARD -- Priest flings another BLADE. This one PLANTS in the leg of the Familiar. He HOWLS. Where is she? They get your gun arm? You're gonna need it. We don't want a fight. We're just looking for the girl. The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one by one, the OTHERS drop from the sky, flanking him. They're scraggly, a little undernourished. You were murderers. We're not going anywhere until you tell us where she is. ,,Yea though r walk through the Valley Of The Shadow Of Death x will fear no Evil -- "" The vampires laugh. Fangs glinting. No need. He'll the at first light. Priest goes to the Familiars still lying on the ground. They're sobbing, having lost everything in the world that mattered. Completely wrecked. He grabs one by the scruff of the neck. Make 'sense. Emerges through the hole, exhausted, the LEAD VAMPIRE'S HEAD in his hand dangling by its hair. He tosses the head and it rolls to Hicks' feet, fangs flashing up at him. Hicks stares at the ghastly visage. Unnerved. How's your arm? Usually. A BEAT as they listen to the popping of the fire. A tension hanging between them. Then - You don't have the stomach for it --head back to Haibridge right now. Hicks glares at Priest. Killing a vampire isn't like killing a man. They come at'you like an animal. Tooth for tooth. What? it just comes. Easy's got nothing to do with it. He pokes at the fire, it CRACKLES, feeding off the bodies. Something about the battle's opened him up. His guard's down. I take no pleasure in it. Killing. I know I've done more than my share -- Whatever they do to me I have it coming. Give me your gun. Give me your gun. Don't anticipate the trajectory of your target. Know it. He stomps his foot into the fire, launching a GLOWING COAL OF ASH into the air. Priest quickly raises the gun and FIRES, the ash explodes, raining fiery red sparks. I'm teaching you to kill vampires. No more wild shots -- There's always-two points. A and B. Know the points and you'll know your target. I see ten crypts ...but only eight vampires. We find the missing, we'll find-Lucy.' What's the next nearest town? Then you better get a good night's sleep. This bunch was easy, their bloodlines watered down by man. How's your arm? You're a halfbreed. A BEAT as Hicks looks to the ground, when he speaks, it's in a voice just below his breath. Miracle? You saw angels? How many? These angels...di.d you ever see them during the day? Home? Vampires sometimes use abandoned structures as a perch.  Watch for booby traps. And with that he enters the-- Stay here. If anything comes up the steps that isn't me -- Shoot it. Before Hicks can reply,.Priest heads down the stairs, darkness swallowing him with every step. No. I should be asking you the same question. Where? Hicks. He starts down the tunnel. The Priestess quickly following. It's too big to fit down here. That's why you're still alive. Leaps from below, darting up the rock, taking advantage of the distraction, landing on the creature's back and wrapping his arms around its neck. Going for the deathlock. With a SHRIEK the creature WHIPS its head with crack force sending Priest flying. The Priestess, still in mid-drop, CATCHES him and they both hit the ground with their feet. Better to keep it contained. The vampire's lathered into an animal frenzy now, wailing and scuttling around the circular wall in crazy patterns. Suddenly -- with a stone shattering BOOM! it BURSTS through the hole, FLYING out into the night. Darts behind a boulder just in time. The creature's talons SCRAPING at the rock before it soars back to the sky, He pulls out his bible, grabbing and tossing a handful of -- This was a Pureblood. .I don't know. A BEAT filled with awkward silence -- when the Priestess kt speaks it comes as a relief for both. An unloosening of things long held tight. I heard that one too. Did you go to The Clergy? Could be. The Priestess glances towards Hicks. He knows. He won't be able to. She pauses a moment, regarding him. Me too. ..Like what? It's a tomb. Big enough for an army. Only one way to find out... You said the next nearest town was Jericho. Then we better go see. We separate. Go through each building, see what we find. On the ground KNEELING. Head down, engaging in some kind of prayer. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they slowly approach, wondering what the hell is going on. As they get closer they see the full We're not going back.  We already are. Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING. She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones, pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools. Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with a He wanted us to find it. It's a clue. Where? He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up. They won't have to. And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO: Retreat! Maybe they were scared of what we could do. With or without the Clergy...we're still Priests. And we're the only ones who can stop that train. No. Whatever happens. .. Wherever it is we go. We'll go together. At that.exact moment something inside Priest shifts just a little bit, a door opens -- never to be shut again. What in greater than God but more evil than the Devil? The poor have it, the rich need it -- and if you eat it...you'lldie. It's a riddle. The Priestess thinks about it. Yes. The good nights. Do you think maybe tonight... I know you're there. A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something just moved through it. Priest quickly turns but there's nothing there. Show yourself. A BEAT as he stands in the ether, waiting. Then -- WHOOSH! Qurye -M onen. ieadjna straight-for pi=. This isn't the time to settle old scores, Rune. I'm older now. We can almost bear Rune smile. It was a war, Rune. Finally showing your true colors. A beat. The Priestess looks at Hicks. He's a halfbreed. Hicks cocks the gun. You've been itching to do this since Nightshade. if she's turned...she's nobody's kin. It's our way. Shoot me and it won't matter if you find Lucy. You won't stop that train -- and you won't save her. The Priestess steps between them, looks at Hicks. Make sure you get on that train, is thrown! His beloved bike FLIPPING across the desert in wild arcs. He hits the earth with a painful skid, using the momentum to roll back onto his feet. He checks his stomach, the wound's of enina t,}g xnorA, staining his shirt bright red. No time for first aid as he turns just in time to see Snaps the chain above his head, bullwhip style, LASHING out. The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a tangled mess. With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger, quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs. Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers. With a SCREECH, their faces burn, bodies instantly SLACKENING in the harsh sun. Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs, knocking the creature off his bike. In a flash, he FLINGS.a helmet into the housing of the last cycle, the bike nosedives, sending the rider across the desert. Eyes brimming with renewed fury, Priest picks up the cycle, VROOOOMI! GUNNING the throttle, mod. ROCKETING towards the train... Seemingly from out of nowhere, motors up to the train car riding the vampire cycle. He grabs onto a gun barrel and SWINGS into an arc, lifting himself off the bike and - .How? Black Hat smiles, baring hi fangs. .They turned you. By murdering innocents? who? So this is how you go about it? One by one killing every last remaining Priest? Yours. I don't believe you. With ferocious instinct, he launches forward, feet digging into the metal. The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact. Rolling across the roof, bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the next car. The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train car after train car passes beneath them. Each leaping at j ust the right moment to land onto the next. But Priest is,outmatched. As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his body dangling over the side. Exhausted and bloodied.  Give her to me! Hurry! -- They'11.get through the door any second! Give her to mei Screeching, ANOTHER VAMPIRE makes it through the opening, Hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot. He picks Lucy up, handing her to Priest. Priest disappears with her, Hicks climbing down behind just as -- the chain finally SNAPS and the door BURSTS open with screeching vampires! Hicks BLASTS away but there's too many of them, they keep coming. He drops into the hole -- Not until we stop the trains But now Hicks isn't even looking at him, his attention caught up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them. What happens next happens fast: Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy, hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as -- E ERYTH ggas BLACK The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition. A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the. Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND HER as if smashing into a building. She doesn't move. A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each other, the cars JUMPING the rails. MMMM gQES BLACK A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the earth, careening through the air. He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching. A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to. A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air. Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful. Terrifying. Then in one horrible instant -- They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits. No, they're not. She knew. He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN as if smashed by the very hand of God. Do you want me to? ""You shall wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit... The words are heavy, each harder than the next. -- As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be. World without end."" sees him but chooses to stay with the Priestess, brushing the hair from her face. .Me too. She reaches up, placing her hand on his chest. Slowly makes his way down the aisle, bruised and bloodied, his very presence a direct affront to this place. A woman GASPS, somebody faints. Stands shell shocked, the level of betrayal staggering. Sends him sailing through the air, Black Hat crashing into a collection of CANDLE HOLDERS, an ancient TAPESTRY catching fire, flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics -- The chamber erupting in an orange blaze! WRENCHES himself from,Black Hat's grip, tumbling. across the floor. WHAPI The cross S LM onto Black Hat, pulverizing hi ! Stares into his eyes and -- Something passes between them something so strong and personal it transcends emotion. Hicks FIRES! But Priest is pone. Hicks looks around -- There's no sign of him, not even the bike."
gamer,KABLE ,Gerard Butler,"  My name's Tillman. My name is Tillman, freak. I killed my best friend. Who's talking? What? Why would anyone want my name? Wait. (he holds the wrinkled photo to the window) How did you get this picture?            Have you seen them?  Turn me around God damn it... Freak. Who the hell is that?  What? Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye. Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot.  But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way. There's a delay... Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls - It's just me. Not interested. Your head ain't on straight. Yeah, probably. - the fuck did you say? Who? How come I can hear you? Gamers can't talk to cons. No. Pay attention to the game. Wait a minute... are you twelve? Bullshit. This is unbelievable. How am I not dead yet? What?

wanted,WESLEY ,James McAvoy," Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic. His wry smile gives way to... Black. And then... It was Rochelle's birthday, which meant there was a certain amount of inter- office pressure to go to Appleby's and sit at a table of twenty-five with my boss Janice presiding at the head even though she's too tight to pick up the bill. Which meant, the poor bastard waiting on us had to split the check twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf, no less -- don't do us any favors, Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of extreme nachos and then polished off a bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single- handedly... The CAMERA DISAPPEARS in the bowl of spinach dip and we... .so by the time I got back to my cubicle, my eyelids were so damn heavy, I had to put my head down, even if it was just for a wink. My name is Wesley Gibson. If you look at the corner of my desk, you'll see the billing reports I was supposed to hand in to Janice an hour ago. The BILLING ORT is highlighted on the screen for just a moment. .then the movie RESUMES normal speed and Janice reaches Wesley's cube in no time... I meant to... I'll do it. I said I'll get it done. I'm sorry. My job title is Account Manager. I used to be called an Account Service Representative, but a consultant told us we needed to ""manage"" our clients and not "" service- them. Onemore ""life sucks then you die."" I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service. Her name's Cathy. She works at Banana Republic. The guy she's humping is my best friend, Barry. She's giving it her best. As her MOANS reach a crescendo, we... I'm sorry, Jesus... uh... what was the question? Well, that's the thing.-  Cycles. Hard market, industry-wide cycles differ from our firm's cycles so I think it's amistake to apply... Sure. Wesley jots down on his pad: ""ACTION ITEMS,"" and underneath it: ""Differential responses... then you die."" He underlines it three times. There are people, everyday you meet them, who you wish could see you in a different setting, a different place... Just then, Nicole, the pretty intern, approaches and starts fishing through the refrigerator. .instead of where you are, what you've become. Wesley sits upright, glad now that no one is sitting at his table. Nicole turns and smiles at Wesley, starts to head his way, when... And you wish to god your eyeballs weren't being sucked out of their sockets by monitor fatigue. That you didn't spend five years in college to do goddamn differential responses. see that he is actually i>laying solitaire on the computer. He keeps checking over his shoulder for Janice, but she is talking on the phone in her office with the door shut. He looks up and watches the computer clock turn from 4:59 to 5:00. He saves his solitaire game and then turns off the computer, snatches up his jacket, waits for Janice to turn her back to him as she is engrossed in her call, and then sneaks away. C'mon, c'mon. After an eternity, the doors open. But at least at the end. of the day... Wesley steps in and turns around. Before the doors close, he sees his boss Janice down the hall, looking at him. She checks her watch and looks back at him, pissed... What? Sorry. Ididn't... I'll be right back. He turns around. I got it. My parents both died when I was born. He grits his teeth as we... The nutjobs I had as foster parents thought any book that didn't contain a red-letter edition was the spawn of the devil... ..so I had to hide my stash like it was a bag of many jane. Stuck in a hole is a copy of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. He moves back around the corner and standing there is his FOSTER MOTHER, pissed as hell... One time my foster mother found my copy of CATCHER IN THE RYE... .she holds a copy of the book in,her hand, getting ready, to strike.. .and God told her to beat me with it. Young Wesley takes a beating, WHAP, WHAP, WRAP! .his face screws up, taking the blows... .But despite them, I thought I was gonna be something special.  I'm sorry?  Sorry? She looks him in the eye. I think you got the wrong guy.  What is this? How d'you know my name? My father died in a car wreck the week I was born... Lady... The Fraternity? What?!! But Fox just leaps into the passenger seat, guns up and ready, as Wesley's legs. somehow take over and he hops behind the wheel. Just then, Cross's ev ll Mound the corner, practically going up on two tires. Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck when it launches forward. He races through the gears and rips around a corner and out into traffic. Where are we going? Hold on! ...whips the car into a rubber-squealing turn... Truck! No! Shoot the tires! Fox looks at Wesley, momentarily stunned by his idea, then spins and fires away at the oncoming truck. The front tires on the truck explode and the truck veers hard right, where it bounces off a Fed Extrugk.,,, hat sends it into a violent roll. Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips forward... right over their car!!! Wesley watches it fly over them, amazed his idea worked... when finally it SMASHES down into the street between them and Cross's Chevellel Cross is forced to slam on his brakes and slide out... but it's too late... his Chevelle smashes into the 4 X 4 before skidding to a stop, a tangled mess in the street. Wesley snaps back to reality and rips the Ferrari off the one-way street and down a side street. Who was that? No. I mean... I told you my father died when I was a baby. She leans right into his face so that their noses are only inches apart. What? What?! I... I guess I'm not sure. Sloan simply picks up one of the pistols and sticks the gun in Wesley's hand. What?! I don't... In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun off the rolling table and ',s -pointing it at Weslev's temple. He begins to count... But I've never heard of... Why would you do that? Sloan puts a hand on Wesley's shoulder, gently. Paternally. Fuck consultants and fuck action items and fuck differential responses. Fuck it all. He takes a seat in the chair, which creaks when he sits in it.  Fuck it all. Is this the beginning of my training? What the fuck are... WHANIlM 4!!!1 The Pharmacist smashes him again. Wesley struggles against the ropes but isn't going anywhere. The Pharmacist rears back. and WHAM! WHAMMM! WHAMQ! keeps hitting him over-and over again until Wesley's eyes roll to the back of his head. You know how when you have a dream and wake up unexpectedly... ...and the dream is still. on the fringe of your brain but you can't quite remember the details? He looks up at his ceiling fan, barely turning, a few blades missing... But then you see that same old busted ceiling fan over your bed and you are so damn glad it was just a dream? He sits up on his bed and checks himself in the mirror. His face has been pummeled; it looks like a piece of squashed fruit. This was nothing like that. Something like that. No. Not really. Same old Wesley. Would you consider me to be an observant person? Just because you have one single iota of tenuous power, you think you can push everyone around? .I understand, Janice, that junior high must have been particularly difficult being called Tubby all the time, but that doesn't give you the goddamn right to treat your workers like horseshit. Sure we laugh at you behind your back and sure we know you keep a stash of jelly doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk... Janice looks down at her fingers, which still have a little grape jelly on them... .and sure everyone takes their lunch an hour before you so we can get an extra hour away from you, and I know that must sting sitting by yourself in the White Castle parking lot every day gnawing on your third burger thinking up ways to humiliate us... Janice's eyes fall to her feet. .you know, if you weren't such a bitch, we might actually feel sorry for you. As it is, I feel I can speak for the rest of the office when I say... FUCK YOU!!! With that, he throws all the papers off his desk, sending them flying! Empowered, Wesley marches toward the elevators as everyone watches him go, admiration plastered on their faces. The loudmouth from the break-room steps out... You were watching? Like I had a gun in my hands. Fox grins as Wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on the pedal. The Diablo's tires smoke as she launches it out of there. They never show you this shit on the McDonald's commercials. .. as the CAMERA FINDS Wesley, who is completely absorbed in the lesson. The Butcher hands him the knife, and Wesley starts to make his first chops at it, wanting to please the Butcher, wanting to get it right... What is this? Computer chips? I suppose you're going to tell me to shoot her first. Mostly B's. Fox cocks her head at Wesley, knows he's lying. Okay, I got a D. I couldn't remember all the rules -- Every day. I don't get it. So we set our own rules. Just the flies. You mean curve the bullet? How? Okay. She moves toward a separate bedroom. Fox? She stops. Really? Wesley looks at her hopefully. She smiles, thinking about the past. You worked with him? My father saved your life? Put a bullet in Burgess? k, What kind of training is that? My father was Burgess, wasn't he? Fox nods, smiling. They step... What? What's this? How? My whole life I thought he was dead. I shouldn't feel any differently just because it happened 20 years later. But, I do. Like I missed my one chance. Can I see his body? These are my father's ashes? Sloan said his heart stopped but there was no entry wound? Can I have a minute? There are two kinds of pain. One is an object. A living thing that crawls around the outside of your body. Cuts, broken bones, bruises... all deliver the kind of pain you can learn to ignore, and they soon disappear to nothing but the sound of a gnat in your ear. Wesley's eyes are starting to lose consciousness. I've lived with a different kind of pain all my life... the kind that comes from two decades of being passed over, pushed around, ignored. But you can't hide from that kind of pain either... Wesley takes a brutal shot to the face. .because it finds you. He involuntarily spite blood as his eyes roll back in his head. No. Fine. Try something else. Nothing. Sloan waits. Wesley realizes it's useless to try to keep something from this man. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center... places it on the table. You told me to hunt down my father's killer. That's what I'm doing. The bullet that killed him. You said his heart stopped but there was no entrance wound. This bullet has a hole cut into its center... You know how a mole buries into the earth by pushing the dirt back around it? I think this bullet does what the mole does... Splits the skin and pushes it back through its center, filling the space it just passed through. Sloan looks at him, like he might have been underestimating him until now. Fox was telling me that my father used special bullets. It looks like Cross does too... which means these are custom made. If we find who makes them, then we find someone who has access to Cross. Firing neurons. What's that? No rules, right? This stops Sloan for a second. What's all this?  This room. The books. Seems low-tech. What's with the red ones? Sloan just smiles... .and THE CAMERA MOVES TO HIS FEET, then PUSHES'IN on one particular street on the map, further in on one RED STREETLIGHT and we... You have stashes... Jesus. Closer. Impressed, the Gunsmith moves the corpse closer to the target, making the angle all that much tougher. Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol starts FIRING next to him. He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &o him, firing at the target. Every shot bends around the body and hits right in the forehead of the target. Wesley smiles, impressed. LIBRARY. Wesley thumbs through an old Fraternity book, which has detailed sketches of an assassination in 17th century Paris. MEAT LOCKER. Wesley working out on a heavy bag, honing his punches, the Chef holding the bag for him, muscles rippling. MAP ROOM. Wesley walks by himself amongst the miniature city, trying to memorize where the red marks are. Cross and my father were tight. But Cross thought he should be one of the heads of the Fraternity so he left and vowed to kill the three heads. Which means my father is dead because of petty jealousy. But I don't see jealousy in those eyes, do you? Fox walks over and slams the binder shut. The journalist who's got a price-tag on his head. Yeah.  Close the gap. Push the body closer to the target.. Closer. Closer. Closer. I'll say when. You wanna go first? Check the target. The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found it's mark on the target. You'll find one entry below the shoulder, missing the major blood vessels there, exiting the back. Second shot went through the abdomen, clipped only the bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, which is partially protected by the ribcage, and passed through the liver and probably part of the gallbladder. Upper left abdomen is a good place, where number four ruptured the spleen before continuing down main street. And finally, what I like to call ""the ,7FK."" Number five entered the mouth, was redirected downward by the upper jawbone ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's the shot you'll find in the middle of the target. Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target.  Fuck the rules. With that, he turns and walks away, a look on his face that is his fiercest, a far cry from the kid in the cubicle. That same expression is on his face as we... One! There is a look in Wesley's eye we, haven't seen before, a burning, searing fire. As he continues to take punches and count them out... Two!  Four! Do you like being the only chick in the Fraternity?  Maybe I have and I'm just not telling you. How did you end up here, Fox? What did you do before? Fox looks at him, a wry smile on her face. No shit? I can't see it. What made them come after you? I mean, I know why I'm here. And yours is? That's terrible. Where's the Diablo? Being a member of the Fraternity was like winning the lottery... Where we headed? You need a new wardrobe or something? A test? Who's the mark? What if I don't? Get down! .and he's looking at a man we recognize from his office... The Consultant. He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of pistols! Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger... .but it lust CLICKS, the chamber empty... Just like my father used on you. Fox nods, as the Security Guards go to help the Consultant to his feet. You were watching me in the office. You've known all along. You knew before I ever broke the urn... Part of my training. There are two things about you I'm sure of right now, little man. One is that you can speak English... Pek War sees that Wesley means business. That my nutsack is bigger than you. Fox snickers. Bullshit. You're as responsible as if you pulled the trigger yourself. I'm only going to ask you one question and I want you to think very hard how you want to answer. With that, Wesley sticks the stiletto into Pek War's side! Relax. The blade is in only an inch or so. The little man starts jabbering to God in some foreign language. See I've learned a thing or two about human anatomy recently. In fact, this blade is stuck just beneath the coastal cartilage of your tenth rib. Just a little push and it will deflate your lung. That's called a pneumothorax. V Helluva way to go, suffocating in a'room full of fresh air. Plus the sound, the sound of all that oxygen hissing out of your lung... pssssssh, like a balloon at a birthday party. Enough to make a man beg for a second chance. So my question is... how do I find Cross? Pek War's eyes go wide, pleading... You know what my foster mother. told me when I was six years old? Fox shakes her head. She caught me eating some jello out of the fridge after my bedtime. I knew I wasn't supposed to but I was so damn hungry, and it was just some fucking jello. Anyway, after she hit me so hard I couldn't bite down straight for a week, she told me... she told me that God had killed my parents because I was such a wicked boy. So I grew up thinking I was the reason I never knew my parents. But now, to find out, that no, my father didn't give me up because he had died... he gave me up because he was Protecting me... well I guess I want to give him something back. Not very discreet, are they? Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley is talking about. On various rooftops we-see FIGURES peering down. looking over the site. No! The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the dock. Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as screaming WORKERS run from the place. He'll be long gone by then. On the pallet. They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching on the pallet on the front. Separate. The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await.  Stay here and cover us. There's no angle for him to hit you if you stay here. Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the machines. Don't let him get up there. And stay clear of the presses! He'll use them however he can. It's what I'd do. With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the machinery. The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a hundred pounds of paper spins through every second. He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that scaffolding. Everything looks clear, until... ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal, until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it to explode! The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and stumbles nearer the printing press... Cross! Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at Cross... who immediately returns fire... .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE. The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each other from sharp angles... Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck, but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man using the same techniques at the exact same time. Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the words ""Action Items"" written on it. He fires at it, and his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!! Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby window, smashing the glass out, He said... he said 'pies on the Fraternity...' Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the whole story. Finally, she nods... Yeah, sure. I think I need.a minute to myself. Naah, that's all right. You need to get stitched up. I'll meet you at that Korean place. Hey. You live here? The kid.nods . Foster home? 4014 The kid nods again. Read this. He tosses the kid the book and heads off. Yes, ma'am. She nods knowingly, sadly. He killed my father... My brother? I'm okay. Wesley sets the key down on the table. Do you know what this opens? Why didn't he just tell me? I'll be back as soon as this is over. Skipped the hospital? I'm all right. Naah. Yeah. Did you know Cross was my father? Did you know? Closer, closer... tight on those pupils... Arrrh! There's a town in Germany called Leverkusen that had a bear hunter named Hans Koblenz. 60 During his life, he was said to have killed over four hundred bears and was the pride of this small community on the Rhine. You want to know how he died? A pair of black bears singled out his house from the entire village, mauled his wife, killed his twin daughters, and then lied in wait for him to get back from the woods. When the hunter opened the door, they ripped his throat out before he could scream. The two bears then curled up on the rug LW in the middle of the floor -- the rug that had once been their father -- and proceeded to bite. each other till they bled to death. Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees beneath it that pearl-handled revolver. The one with the blood on the handle. That's a true story. He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper: My father... he was working on a plan, right? Can I see that for a second? The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is painted jet black, except for one corner of the first floor, which is painted red. Wesley looks up at Anna. Do you know where he got this? Only he didn't know where on the route they would try and hit Helms. That's the missing piece he was t rying to figure out. No. But I know who does. It's me, Nicole. I asked you once if you thought I was an observant person. She doesn't understand... but suddenly we...  Maybe I have and I'm just not telling you. .and now with the gift of hindsight, we see that Wesley meant what he said, and we... Sloan didn't just have one person in my office watching me, he had two. What name do you go by? The Intern? He points at her tattoo. Because I know you have the mark. Nicole's face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a switch. Like lightning, she grabs for a butcher's knife but Wesley is faster. He pins her wrist back, twisting until she drops the knife. She lunges again, but a pistol comes up right below her chin. Where's the Henry Helms hit going down? Where's Sloan? Yeah? Why's that? She reaches over, slowly, so he knows she's not going to go for a knife... and she turns on a small TELEVISION sitting on the kitchen counter. The screen comes to life, showing an inf mercial for the F ob'e. Nicole shakes her head and. flips up the channels... and now we see what she wanted to show him... Motherfucker. Dispose of the weapon...  I'm only going to ask you one more time. Where can I find him? Then this is going to get painful quickly. She stares at that blue flame, fear in her eyes for the first time. He starts pushing her head toward it, closer and closer... Henry Helms. Where is it going down? The first SCREAM from Nicole is lost in... Looks like you missed your chance. Now where is Sloan? The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice. Should've studied your anatomy, fellas. Wesley FIRES BACK indiscriminately at the neighboring rooftops, lying on his back, using the.dead assassin's body as a shield. I remember some dumb shit like that coming out of your mouth. Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out the kniZ2 in his shoulder. They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging off each other as each tries to gain an edge. The fight spills out the front door, and into... But you can hear. So hear this: To cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice- pick style... Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it. ...and thrust down behind the clavicle, cutting side to side. He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over as his gore spills out into the street. But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new predicament... He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end is the chef, and at the other is the Gardener. To make things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him. I'm working off of a different map. With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a Lexus parked at the curb. The three assassins fire relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car, smashing it to bits... as... . on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just as he reaches that cement block... affixed to it is a small SILVER CROSSI Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new pair of sophisticated MA ISHIS I As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we... Where is he? But now you have to dispose of the weapon. Fuck you. Sloan's eyes narrow. Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic. We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve... But not today. With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun, the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they both open fire... .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan does the same. Just like he did with h' father. .But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took the knife. I'm done with this life. Just like my father. And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h It's true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary and-pathetic. Just like you. He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME. But I've learned something in that time. I've learned about the man who made me. I've learned about the man I am. I've learned that all of us are unique, even though sometimes we're too fucking blind to see it. And I learned, the easiest place to hide is in plain sight. .it comes back DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, until it finds... Just started last week. All over the place, really. Nothing too exciting. Yes, sir. Of course. You want to take a break with me? Well, you'll find there's nothing ""usual"" about me. They climb in. THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Wesley's face... This life is ours, to make of it what we can. .until it fills the screen, looking just like the shot of Wesley we started with. And then a sly smile spreads across his mug... I think I'll give it a shot. .and as the doors close, we officially..."
scream_3,GALE ,Courteney Cox," Good morning Hollywood. And today officially starts the Summer movie season. Opening the box office this week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins in Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs in American Pastry, and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer in STAB 2, based off my best selling book the WINDSOR MURDERS. Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed to the occasion. Today we have director of the upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice welcome to the set of Total Entertainment. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman. Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's    your favorite scary movie? Your life? Would you excuse me for a moment? Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me. Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI. So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in? A note? That's Sidney Prescott's mother. I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk. Djr vu-do. Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.  Show him. Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to. Oh come on! Why the hostility?  They're the ones who approved it. Alright Kincaid, no where to? Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around. Shit. Can I even get a ride home? Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective? Who? But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help. Please, call me Gale. Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect? Hey, fuck off. So, what now? Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past. This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again. Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS. Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you? You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else. It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer! It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different. Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you? All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you? Always. And? Someone stole Sid's file?  I'm sorry, this is too good! Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? And who is that? Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to? I happen to work for the police god dammit! Neither are you, Magnum P.I. Fuck! Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker. Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings. I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU. Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting? Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?  AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap? Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business. I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen. Oh use your brain drama queen! Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door? Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in some big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or Chucky? Huh? Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door! Who's phone?  Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want? I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy! No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look! What? Come on! But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it! Four? There are five. OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott. Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott! Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey. Thank you. What'd he say? Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory! Has anyone else every used your phone? Who's this. I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later. I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set? What the hell are you doing? I am Gale Weathers! None. And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch. Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.  No really? Possibly. Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.  Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down. I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me? Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?  Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you. Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?  It may be Maureen Reynolds -- What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'? Dew! Sidney, what happened? We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth. She was an actress Sidney. Minor B-Movies. But now we have a new suspect in this twisted fucking web . . . John Milton. It makes sense doesn't it? It's his big grandiose swan song from the genre. What a better way to end than with a bloodbath? Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay John Milton a little visit. Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom? Nobody said she was an actor. Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth? And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing? Just because you knew her? I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood? Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking. Are you saying she was- Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.  Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus. Oh Dewey I'm sorry. Here. Let me -- Shit. That's gonna leave a mark. Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.  Dewey!  He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!  Awfully late time to be doing an interview.  Sidney, stay away! Dewey! No! Oh God!  Oh God! Christ Sidney hurry up! That fucking lunatic is coming! I know! He killed Kincaid! Let's get out of here! Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here! He can't get us both! RUNNN!  Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain Gale Weathers.  I know all the tricks!  THIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD! BITCH! WHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!  Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly."
gladiator,MAXIMUS ,Russell Crowe,"  A people should know when they are conquered. At the first signal release the catapults.  We'll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat. I hope not, because I'm going to be leading them. Why don't they know they're already dead?  Hold steady... steady... Steady... Brothers -- I salute you!  For Rome! Caesar. I don't think there's anyone left to fight. Should Caesar permit, I'll go home. I've been away too long.  I've forgotten my wife's face and I barely know my son.  Come, Caesar... For the glory of the empire, sire. They honor you, Caesar. Highness.  Caesar, you do the lady injustice.  If you'll excuse me, Highness. What, Gallus, losing your other hand? And the women of your village will crave your touch even more. What's your name, son? The name suits you. You're dying because you love Rome, as I do. Neither have I.  Rome for us lives here... (he touches his heart) ... it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children. Yes, it's a glorious place.  If you want to stay on, I support you.  So do the men.  I'll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place. I'll return after a season at home. Maybe two. Should the Gods so bless me.  I would be thankful. Yes.  I'm going home. No. I'm a soldier, not a politician. I can't do that. My men have been fighting for five solid days.  They're too busy dying to go on dress parade.  Caesar. I never acquired the art, sir. Caesar, I am honored but -- Sire, you brought the light of the Gods to barbarian darkness.  You brought civilization and justice to the farthest -- Yes, Caesar. You're not dying. Caesar, you do me honor -- but your son has pride of place for succession. I shall, Caesar. You have always been my father.  That's not true. I lost too many men. I don't know. I never acquired your comfort with it. No.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired from the battle. I will always serve the ideals of Rome. Yes. Yes. May I be permitted to go, Highness? And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea.  All that was a different life. It was more honest. I thank you for your prayers. Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you for your guidance.  Bring me your solace and your wisdom.  Blessed Mother, come to me in my dreams with the Gods' desire for my future. Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword.  Keep them safe until my return.  Whisper to them in their sleep that I live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air.  Ancestors, true bloodline, I honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me. Quintus -- ? What is it?  Is he ill? How did he die? How did he die? How will the world speak your name now, old man? What -- ?! Quintus -- Quintus, what -- ?  My family?! What about my family, Quintus? Have you ever done this before? Killed a man with a sword? It can be very messy -- you could get blood all over your armor.  You don't want to hack me up now.  You want one clean stroke. One good stroke -- you do know where, don't you? If you miss the spot there'll be blood everywhere.  Quite a spray. Here -- you don't want to hit the vein on the neck -- Put the point of your sword here... you want one, good blow right at this spot --  Am I in Hades? Gladiator. Nothing more.  The Emperor -- will he be there? Have you -- how does one meet the Emperor? Yes. He give it personally? You knew Marcus? No. Bigger arena.  Same killing. No. This isn't my home. Perhaps one day you'll return. Yes, but -- What -- ? I AM MAXIMUS MERIDAS, GENERAL OF THE FELIX REGIMENT OF THE ROMAN ARMY AND SERVANT TO THE EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS! I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE! This isn't your battle. I knew your brother would send assassins.  I didn't think he would send his best. My family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive.  Don't lie to me. Don't. My son was innocent. I want your brother dead. How do you plan it? So the crown passes to your son. What is your son's name? I weep for him. What can you tell me? I was a General. It doesn't take courage to kill. I'm sorry. I had a father.  He wasn't really my father but I cared for him very much. Where is my army? I will not kill another warrior. There is no honor to it. Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus' festival. Yes.  But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus, no one else.  The Felix Regiment will never be defeated. I want Commodus dead. Because one night an old man whispered to me about a dream.  I will die for that dream. He did. As will I, Commodus.  As will I. I only have ancestors because of you, brother.  You killed everything that ever lived alongside me. This is the new home you cursed me to.  And I am safer here from your treachery than I could ever be outside. Why don't you ask your father that? I have more power as a slave in the arena than I could ever have as a free man.  As the Colosseum goes, the people go.  As the people go, the Empire goes. No, Caesar... I will show you. The Felix Regiment will come from here.  We'll face the body of the Praetorians outside -- here.  Once inside, my archers will take up position to counter opposition inside the Colosseum.  I'll enter and join you -- we'll attack here -- -- a covert assault from within. Probably. But if we aren't... think of the glory.  Do you remember glory, Gladiator? Then be worthy of him.  The old Titan who would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and fat. Was it Centurion...?  General...? A soldier knows a soldier. No -- You said something to me once.  You said in this life, we all die.  All we can choose is how we die.  And how we are remembered.  Do you recall those words? Then be remembered proudly.  This is your time, Proximo.  Stand at my side and be what you were.  What you truly are.  One last time. You pox-ridden bastard -- !  A quarter?! You know, if you were half so awful as you pretend, you'd be a terrifying man. Lucilla -- Good. You've told me this already. Lucilla... why are you here? No. Yes. Yes. Yes.  I will. And if I should not survive... swear to me that you will honor my family in your prayers always. Shhh... my heart breaks enough. But -- We were betrayed. You're not coming? Old friend... Where is he? I forgive you. Throw down your weapons or we will kill you.  FELIX REGIMENT!  DO HONOR TO YOUR ANCESTORS!  I SALUTE YOU! Captain?  Where are they going?! For my wife! For my son! For my father! We who are about to die salute you. Rome... you are better than this. Look inside yourselves.  I challenge you to find your true voice.  Help the Senate speak for you.  Make them your champion... And dare to think what could be. I give you back the dream. When everything has calmed down, lead an orderly withdrawal.  Take them home. It doesn't look it now... but soon we'll have it growing again... Next year there will be vines, and then there will be grapes... It will be alive."
enough,SLIM ,Jennifer Lopez," Hi, can I help you? What would you like? Want a menu? Hey Billy. Hey Tom. You take care, Rosie. Sure thing, Annie. Have a good one. That's two straight up. You're good to go. Morning. Hey there. Morning to you.  What? (looks down, sees she's carrying lunch food) Right. Afternoon. What can I get you? Whattaya like? Whattaya want? (rolls eyes; good-humored rejection of a.come-on:) Nice try, bud - And you're only like 299 thousand short of what you'd need for law school. Piece of pie - I don't know... Psychology maybe, I don't know. I know it's not cool to say so, but I'd like to contribute something to society, even if - Ever try the rock, hey? The deodorant thing. It's salts or something, it comes in like a...it looks like some kinda hippie crystal. Perspire, Ginny. You lightly - Waiting for somebody? He shakes his head. She can't help noticing he's very handsome. I'll give you a minute to look over - No. No, I don't tell my name. Oh. Finneaan's Wake by James Joyce. A friend told me it's the hardest book in the English Language. Not the hardest hardest, just the hardest one it's actually possible to read, and I figure if I can get through that one, I can do the others. Six years. I'll be back with your Wanted to find out how smart I was so I told him I was reading the hardest book in the English language. I think he's just a dick. I know - Okay, so he likes me. I don't know him. I didn't notice. He's cuter than me?? tinny gives her a long stare; this is obviously a favorite TB, coleslaw, and so forth. You don't really write books, do you? I don't read Finnecan's Wake either. Who's the rose for? He shrugs. She's busy, so she starts to go: Enjoy your grub, huh? She's seven feet away when she hears:  Was it two hundred or five? No. Hey. Thank you. He nods, keeps going.  I... I can't believe you actually said something. You sure,you love me? For ever and ever? He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions: Oh yeah. How soon can we get out of here? He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor. Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true... It's Slim, is he there? Water is flooding down the barstool; she's miscarried. Well, will you please just... Just tell him I'm sorry, okay? I lost this one too. Who was that? Hey.  Oh. You just paged my husband, right? It's too late to deny it. Tell me your - A rustle on the other end - Don't hang upl Don't be a cowardl Silence. Just your name. That's the least you could do, don't you think? A simple plea, one woman to another... How can you do this to Gracie? He doesn't say anything. Darcelle paged you. That' s where you're going, right?  Yeah. Wow. Mitch? Can you please? Can you sit here with me? He does. She doesn't know where to start, how to talk about it... She's French? No. Yes. Mitch?, I can't... I couldn't stand for this to... I'm happy, I've really been happy, and I don't want to - You... Damn it! You said I was safe with you! I smell her. Her perfume. Darcelle or whoever.  How many, Mitch? How many are there? How many have there been? Including you? He contemplates his answer...and shrugs. No! No! No! I can't do this anymore! I can't! Just take it, and take it, and take it!? I'm not strong enough! I don't know who would be. I love you, okay? I love you and I'm your wife and you can't do this! You understand me?!!! No more! No more! With the same speed he attacked ""Our Hero"" at the diner, Mitch's hand shoots out like a snake striking. Slaps her. A warning: stop it and stop it now. Her face: shock. Confusion. Outrage. She raises her hand to her cheek. Touches her skin where his fist landed... He reads her expression and is almost amused:  No. You can't. He hits her again, this time with a closed fist. It's your rules. And if I don't like the rules?? Tomorrow may be great. Tomorrow will be great. (Without you . ) He appears to miss her inference. Your mother. I'm supposed to bring Gracie tomorrow. Maybe I better cancel.  I gotta pick up Gracie at pre-school. What?? It's your loaf of bread. Where are you? Why didn't you tell me you were going to - When are you coming home? Educate me. I want to be happy. He's not sure of her subtext, but he's willing to give her the benefit of the doubt :  He'll come after me and kill me. Mitch overhears this, smiles. Wow ... whattaya think, Toots? Jesus, are you okay? He scare you? Joe shakes his head - more at Mitch than in answer to her question. I'm dangerous to know right now. At the restaurant? Hey. Gin. You okay? What? What about you and Phil, did you - Get out. I got a bad feeling, Gin. I know! That's what I'm saying! Get Phil and get out of there! Nowt Run, okay?t Ginny?! Runt The line went dead. Joe stares at her, concerned. She presses redial, and we hear THE PHONE start to ring... She- goes to the window, parts the curtain: OUTSIDE in the street, the FBI MEN sit in their car - No answer on the phone. Slim looks at Joe and shakes her head: this isn't good. I know you don't want to see me or know about me, but I am desperate, I had nowhere else to go...I need your belg!  You want me dead? He shrugs affably and leads her into his office - You are my Dad, Jupiter. When Mom died, I wrote you, you didn't answer. I didn't have enough money to bury her, that was really fun. No, you had help. I thought you should meet your granddaughter. And yes, we need money. To survive. It's like a joke to me too. (stunned...} Well. Now I know. Used to be if I did something nasty, my temper got the better of me?, I'd wonder where the hell it came from. Thanks for clearing that up. Wait. Wait. What're you...? Who're you...? Hello? Where are we going? The Driver answers her in a Middle-Eastern language. Gracie looks alarmed. It's okay, Sweetheart, they're friends of Phil's. You're not afraid to help me? No. Phil, wait a minute, I - I know, but - What about the police? The fire. Do they - 2? That's good on a race-horse, Gin, but for Gracie?, to lose both parents? Besides, this is me, i couldn't kill anybodyl Even so. I'm not that kind of person, okay? Ginny nods reluctantly. She's not sure the subject is closed. Yes, I lost my birth certificate - BIRTH CERTIFICATE for Erin Shleeter in Slim's hand - SOCIAL SECURITY CARD, in her hand - DRIVER'S LICENSE, with Slim's photo: her hair's a different color and she wears glasses. The name is Erin Shleeter,. DRESS SHOP: new clothes, new outfits, new look, new Slim - You're not the Queen of England anymore either. Gracie nods fatalistically, stares out the window. Flat voice: I'm thinking. Beat. Anybody talks to you, hit the horn. I need the best lawyer in town. Please. Just a name. Watch how it's done. 117 Slim goes to the Receptionist's desk: Hi. Is Mr. Toiler with someone? I'm not a crazy person. She walks past the Receptionist - I know, but I'm desperate.  My husband keeps trying to kill me, and I need to talk to somebody who's smart, okay?, smarter than me at least.  This is all the money I have - well, all but twenty - it's almost 500, and I'll give you all of it if you'll just listen to what... ... just two minutes, okay? Please? She's so charming and intense and discombobulated, he can't help but give in. He...he already did.  .That's all?  You're not gonna help me? I gotta make you a solemn promise, Grace. Gracie is, of course, fast asleep. Ever since you were born ... well-one day I started to think of all the awful things that were gonna happen. People you'd love who'd die, or leave you, betray you, break your heart... .Physical injuries: broken bones or sickness or guys who hurt you some way... And I thought that if I could protect you even once, from any of those, if I could absorb any part of that myself... Oh yeah? How 'bout Horace? Ginny glances at one of her kids, evidently Horace's child. Rent a car, drive to Denver, then fly to Reno.  You noticed. Dialtone. We watch from a distance as Ginny shakes her head in disbelief, mutters to her kids. As they trudge off, the CAMERA FOLLOWS. I had to make sure you weren't followed. There's a credit card and cash. It's on me, but make no calls home, or to Phil. Think of it as a vacation till the Orca reopens. Toots? Take care of her, okay? Extra ice- cream and... and if you need to reach me...  Just don't call your friends. In an emergency, I'm #1 on the auto- dialer. Or I'll call you. Any calls between us must run is seconds or less. Cake? Ass.  Enjoy it, huh? The custody hearing's end of next month. That's my deadline.  He's a lot bigger. He's a lot stronger. No way. It takes.twice as much energy to swing and miss as to swing and hit. That's not possible - You're saying - For the sake of this exercise, he hits me. He's standing over her. She looks completely vulnerable. I don't care what you want. This almost makes him smile; he's getting to like her. So? Good. .I hope so.  The English guy is good too. What? I thought Jupiter was like all-powerful, king of the Gods? Oh yeah. One more thing. At some point.. .not right now 'cause it'd be phony ...I need you to acknowledge that I'm your kid. She walks away. He stares after her. Hint of a smile comes to his face. You sure this'll work? Thanks, I will. She leaves, taking out her cell phone. FOLLOW HER as she goes: Yes. Tony. Could you please tell Mrs. Tyler that I'll call her around f our this afternoon. It's closed? And I'd guess whoever owns it isn't a very nice person. Why here? People on the street? We were hoping to see some action, but it looks like they're closed. The Shady Character stares back. He is ve skeptical. He watches Slim and Alex walk off down the block. Alex mutters under his breath: She's coming day after tomorrow, then we're flying to L.A. I was thinking after the hearing, maybe I could bring her by. I was out in the country, Mrs. T. I'm in a big city now, meeting with my lawyer, so there're lots of cell phones. No one can trace this. Say something else. They have to think I'm still here, so use my cell phone, tomorrow, to call my dad. Autodial 2. Slim presses the autodial number, then SEND, and motions for Tova to put on Slim's gray coat. It fits Tova perfectly.  Hey, it's me. I don't know, I'm getting some bronchial thing. Yeah. Tomorrow stay in, order room service. Call him twice. Keep it brief. ""Hello, I don't feel well..."" Go around the corner, eat at Guido's. Green trenchcoat. Tova nods and Slim takes off her own wig. Short dark hair. Wish me luck, huh? Luck has nothing to do with it. Tova smiles. I'm in. Can you stay off the phone? I hope so. She hangs up. Retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out tools, equipment, etc. Picks up a screwdriver and starts searching the apartment, checking the phone line, following it to the place where it enters the apartment. MONTAGE INTERCUT WITH FLASHES of Slim' a face: a running tab on her emotions. Intensity, focus, determination, fear,. ..and, as the sequence builds: concern about what she doing... "". .thanks for letting me come talk about Gracie. And I'm glad you're willing to admit your temper, and - let's not mince words - the physical abuse you subjected me to."" And glances at SECOND LETTER: ""Perhaps with your new attitude, we can really work something out. Per your last letter, I'll see you the evening of..."" She puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was. They're not in envelopes; they're loose, open. She picks up the metal detector, resumes her search. The machine beeps insistently around his desk. She can't find anything. Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the drawers: a second gun is in there. With the gun are papers: reports from private detectives looking for her, an assessment of his custody rights... She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper. Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie. Rips it up. Puts the metal detector back in the duffle. Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants. Takes the distinctive red bag  out of the duffle. There's a machine inside. She plugs it in, tucks it behind the couch. Puts her cell phone beside it. You know. What you told me. Beat. On Slim's face as: Yeah. She hangs up, turns the machine back on and stashes her cell phone. With simple ease, she lowers herself onto the chair. Facing the door. Waiting in the fading light... It's me. He nods slowly. You always did forget to turn off the coffee. He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor - It's a machine. Knocks out cell phones. He throws the cell phone onto the bed. Walks out of the bedroom area. Looks around the vast space. Spooky. Slanting light and dense shadow. He doesn't see her. I found that gun too. He stops. Doesn't know where to go. or what to do. Scared? Now is when you decide, Mitch.  Whether you're a coward. If you are, you can run. I won't stop you. Threw 'em away. No. Why not? Woman, Mitch. Fair to whom? As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area between two couches. She has no weapon. She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny. He moves toward her. This is what you wanted, right? What you were going to San Francisco for: the chance to get me alone? He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses. He begins to stalk her. And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in the way she was practicing. Self defense is not ,murder. This stops him cold.. He lowers his hands a moment. Stares at her, trying to assimilate this new information... So far you're attacking me. He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in - She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps over the couch to avoid being hit. He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good, and she's waiting for him as he stumbles - With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose. He goes down. Stays there. For the first time it occurs to him: this might not be easy. He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood. You see? I'm just defending myself. He resumes stalking her. Only he's angry now, and it's scary. I told you. Self-defense. I came here, as arranged in our letters, to talk about Gracie - In the drawer where your pistol was. You just left prints all over them. He stares at her, stunned in every way. Touches his forehead, feels the blood... You attacked me, I fought back. And of course if you never touch me... I'm confused, Mitchy. Aren't you a man? It's a martial-arts cliche, honey. A weapon throws you off balance - You see? He turns toward her, pain on his face, holding his hand - And she truly attacks for the first time. Smashes her fist against his head - He flies back, bounces vs. the wall. As he comes off it, she punches him again - He roars with rage, lunges at her, head first, great speed - She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed - Right into the opposite wall. The top of his head hits the wall. He shudders like someone in a cartoon: a spasm running head to I can't, Gin. Yeah. Listen to me! I did it, but I can't do it! I can't kill him! Behind Slim, out of focus: movement, a soft blur... I know - I know all that! I have to, but I can't! I'm not a killer! I'm not him! Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp. She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side - - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull. Still sends her crashing to the floor. Now she does not move. He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but triumphant. Hi. Gin, he's ...he hit his...he's not breathing. Yeah. Okay. As Ginny talks, Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building. See you soon. She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water. Then the duffle. They both sink. This time be nice to her. Yeah. Jupiter smiles, shakes hands with Gracie:"
scream_2,SIDNEY ,Neve Campbell," I got it. Hello?  Hello? Yes? Who is this? Cory Gillis. 442-8730. Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted under penal code 653M... Enjoy the movie. Nah... I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes. I can't believe I let you talk me into going Greek. Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think? What murders? What's going on? What's going on, Dewey? Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything? Oh my God. How could it happen? It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie. Yeah, right. No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it. You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here. Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat... No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence. I skipped. Too many ""That's her"" looks. Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo. No PDA. This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry? You're not allowed to ask that. Thanks, Joel. It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper. No special treatment. I can do this. C'mon Hallie. Hello, Gale. I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that... Yeah, well... you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews. It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas. My morn was a Delta. Randy? What are you doing here? Cotton... What are you doing? You BITCH! Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.  Any news? The forbidden subject. It's starting all over again. I'll get my jacket. Hello? Who are you? What do you want? Then come and get me. Derek. He's in the house. Help... me... Please, I have the perfect excuse. Gotta. Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way. This is exactly what I don't want. But... My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends. What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?  ""Pain, yah, such pain. Pain."" Shit. Did I? Yeah, right. It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside. I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please. What do you want? Do you work for her now? Me, too. Randy. Me too. Wanna get outta here? Yeah. Cotton. I don't think that's a good idea. What do you want from me, Cotton? I did that. How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life - how do I apologize for that? Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist. Did it? What? I don't know. I don't think Cotton did it. It's too predictable. I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive. I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. Thanks for the movie, Randy. No, it's not. It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men. I'm sorry, Derek. Excuse me? Did your computer just freeze? I'm not signed on. He's here. He's in the room right now. No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me. Someone else has been killed. I'm fine. I wish people would stop treating me like glass. I'm not gonna break. I'd really just like to be alone. Dewey, there's no such place. No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright. But who would operate your camera? He's cool, Remy. It's not a good idea, Hallie. Whatever. Where are you taking me? I feel like Eddie Murphy. SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY! Oh God, help me. We have to call the police. Do you have keys? I need to get inside. Shit! Mickey? Mickey? Oh God, no, Mickey... Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here. He's after me. I'll be right back. Watch out. Don't panic. Watch out. Hey. Hallie? Hello? Hallie? No. This is a set up. Why? You're not going to get away with this. Gale! Okay, look, you guys - I applaud your methodical expertise but I have a question. What's going to happen after I die? I thought the heroine is supposed to live. But nobody wants to see that. It'll never go. They'll rewrite you. You don't want that. You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos... Mrs. Loomis? Oh my God. Why Mrs. Loomis? You'll never get away with this. NOOO! Please, Cotton, don't do this. It's over, Cotton."
copycat,M.J. ,Holly Hunter," My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that. I'd feel a whole lot safer with Sister Loretta for my backup.  Look at this guy: you shredded him! It's sloppy shooting.  It's in character, Ruben, but unnecessary. And bad for your career. Perp's holding a hostage, the shoulder on his gun hand is gonna be exposed. Answer it. You hit the brachial nerve... You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them. The problem is between your legs. You told your shrink about that?  Don't take that mess in the car. Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already here. I just got here myself, Susan. I just got here.  Talk to you later...  What the hell does she want to do, scare everybody to death?  That the Landlady?  You wanna talk to her, Ruben?  Who was first on the scene?  I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer? You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me. I'm seeing ligature marks on her neck here, petechial hemorrhages in her eyes.  Strangled. That's real old material, get a new writer... Hello? What is this about, Ms Martinez? Anybody find it? Cover her up, please. Mike.  Why don't you tell me what's bothering you? Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later. Who came in after you? Well, it's all right, then, Mike. Thanks.  Get me good faces on the crowd here.  Get a couple of harness bulls to grab anybody who starts to run... You messed with the scene. You messed with the evidence. Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not. The stocking around the neck. Right. Right.  Good. Because it's your job, that's all.  Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...  Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers... Who is this? Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here. I'm really interested in your ideas.  The moon bike.  What is that? No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help. Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...  That's an opinion, not evidence...  Helen Hudson.  Get Ruben back here? Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.  Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control. Who? Because of your phone calls.  You talked to me.  Do you remember?  I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you. You called us, Doctor Hudson.  Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love. Would you want to work with us on this? I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours. Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good. You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out? We'll get the paramedics... Tell her we're sorry we bothered her. Tell her to ask for me... Snotty neurotic bitch... Sure.  She likes you, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.  Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef. The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial. What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson. Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help. That's always your privilege, sir. Yessir. Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.  Oh, I know. You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business. Well, you outranked me, Nikko. Don't put yourself down like that. I never used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!  God, you're cute when you're mad. He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson? Honest to God, Ruben! Tell it to your shrink.  For months... last October.  How do you know that?  Nothing. How did you know they were stockings? Why imitate a dead serial killer? Work with me. Let's get out of here... Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach. I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon. So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information? How do you know that? How did you do that? Can you make a copy we can show on our computers? Why would he send this to Helen Hudson... I'm going to put a guard on your door. He won't. We'll show that to... Oh, maaaaan?! We could use a little help. We saw it.  The unknown target is kneeling, she's gardening.  Red hair, high cheekbones, mid- thirties, height I don't know, she's not overweight, she's zofting... She's in front of a house that looks like... ... the Marina area, there was earthquake damage repair on the house it looked like, a little garden.  The light was late afternoon.  Say about cocktail hour.  He was bringing out drinks, margaritas by the look.  So we got a house facing west, on the east side of the street.  Full sun, so there's no high trees or buildings, residential both sides. Tell her about what? I don't look at pictures.  I look at the real thing.  I don't feel infected. I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen. A forgery of the Mary Sullivan murder scene, he's done it perfect. Except for the sign. Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that? For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's talking to you. Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in your computer? My promise. That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going? I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.  Somewhere down the line we're doing to find a connection between him and you.  I want you to worry that idea like a loose tooth.  Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here. Tell me what you see. What about her arms? Look at her legs. If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up? What the hell are you doing?  The Mouth and the Haircut are right down there, thank God they didn't see that. Niccoletti, they're on the wrong side of the tape, you want to push them back?  Now. Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report. Yeah, everything's different. Get the pictures, and casts of footprints. That's all we need... Detective Niccoletti? Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on the wrong side of the tape.  We're still trying to find any footprints or tire marks and we don't want to chew up the ground, okay?  I'll talk to you later.  You, too. We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement... Ruben, put the light on... Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody inside the case! You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of evidence? The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. Anything.  You're like some horny little teenager. Anybody who's ever watched TV knows about that corner. Everybody could see you -- unshaved, same clothes from yesterday, reeking of sex.  Park the car.  Call the lab.  Get Doc to lean on the coroner for a really fast prelim on the sperm. When you get it, call me. It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests... You're damn right I do. I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it. Helen Hudson... Because I think I'm wrong. We've got another one. But it's a different m.o. She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says ""no dumping.""  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and posed... Something's wrong with it. Who turned off the Internet computer... He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch? Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is intense.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate. Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside. Hello, Ruben...  So that's that... Ruben, Dr. Hudson wants me to thank you for taking care of her last night.  Lab report on the new one.  At least two guys penetrated her. There were two kinds of sperm.  The poor thing.  What it must have been like. So far nothing they test for comes up positive.  That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning. That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots... I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...  Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.? He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...  You're afraid of him.  I'm giving you Clint outside. Halloran. I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own. Because I'm all you've got.  I like the real smart Helen Hudson a lot, I'm Goddamned sick and tired of the hysterical little girl, Helen.  You asked your way in -- I don't forget that.  You've got a nickname around here -- ""Deep Throat"" from all the phone calls, I wonder if you know that.  Go take a xanax, I've got to got to work. Was this on?  When you found the car was the tape player on or off.  Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work... Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young. Helen... excuse me, we... Tony! Let me see the slug outta the door! What's that siren? Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam? Helen, Ruben's going to drop by. He's got some questions. Answer me!!... I need a unit at 19809 Lorenda Drive.  Tell them to approach code 2 and wait for instruction.  Find the goddamn officer supposed to be on security.  Ruben's on his way. He'll go in alone. Over here. Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't... Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop... She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes. How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson? Okay. What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together... If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.  Give him thatpompous son of a bitch. Yeah.  Addressed to you.  ""Don't lose your head."" He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem. I put my ass on the line, giving you that. It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba. It's clear he thinks he knows me. He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't lose your head.'  Is that a threat? Does he want to cut off my head? Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else? Kemper.  Did Gacy?  Rivkind?  I think Rivkind did. They get fan letters... Thank you for your help, Warden Hillyer.  As soon as you can. They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: ""you make that your little job.""  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum? Thanks, Warden.  She'll talk to him. Do those things really help? I brought back a gin-seng popper for you.  Guaranteed all-night orgasms. Save it for Helen. Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place... I gotta have Ruben, and a...  Lieutenant...? The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect... I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's... Or the F.B.I.? Give me Ruben back... I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up... Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten? Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm... Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious... You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten. Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself... You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number. You already made the delivery? What Friday? Hey, you... Gigi!  Dock 47.  I need a couple units to drag the area... Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say? You're in terrible trouble, Nikko. Who gives a fuck? You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up... Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he... I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both! A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch married men!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?! Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work. What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?  Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.  Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech... I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here? I've got to go.  I've got to go. How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep? Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out. Like the others -- he'll pick the most extravagant murder -- Bundy's three murders in one night at a... ...Chi Omega sorority house.  Find out how many Chi Omegas there are on college campuses this area. Hundred mile radius. What are the FBI doing? You want to get onto the DMV, we want records on all gold or yellow colored VW bugs, any year.  I want an in-person check on every registered owner.  If it's rental -- check rental first -- get names and location of who is driving one now. Alert Campus Security on college campuses, all of them.  They should warn all female students with long straight dark hair parted exactly in the middle -- I'm serious! -- to avoid any strange male contacts and report any man with an apparent handicap who tries to get them to carry groceries or books, or push his car...  That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning? You or us gonna do it? Just horseshit luck. Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top. Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go. This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk. Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous. Police business -- take your heads off. Don't make me pull the gun...  Call the police!  Now!  Call Qui...  Call Quinn and Saks. Jesus that hurts.  You think the rib is busted? I'll take some Tylenol and codeine, instead, how about a lot of number six?  Oh, God. She's in no shape to give her statement tonight... You could use a long hot bath, you know that?  You better get somebody to drive you home.  Well, thanks."
backdraft,BRIAN ,William Baldwin," Who asked you? You wouldn't let me die, would you, Dad? Sure! Dad... If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing. I want another shot, Sir. If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top -- I need another one, sir. No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.  See you Monday. Sir. Completely out of control. A beer, Willy! It's in my blood, Willy. Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need. Management were pin heads. Coffee sucked. I was ahead of my time. Engine 115, right? Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments. Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.  Mrs. Viatkus...  Jennifer. You look great. Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today. So... I see you're still in the neighborhood. Yeah? What have you been up to? Really? No kidding. Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends. Backdraft. I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me. Not likely.  Hey, you forgot... this. Hey, Sean. What's goin' on, man? It's Uncle Brian. Y'know.  ""Spinach? We don't need no stinking spinach"". Remember? Hellooo... Hi, Helen. Man, you look great. Four months. I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department. That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant. Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle? Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway? Oh, man, I'm sorry. Hey. I talked to Helen... ...Man, I thought dad's boat was finally retired to the family graveyard. Don't you worry about falling out of this thing? I like what you've done with the place. Been ripping off fire stations? Bachman Turner Overdrive? (looks through music rack) ...Buffalo Springfield?... Stephen Bishop? Oh man... My God, an actual operating 8-track. In the Field Museum once. It worked when you were in sixth grade. Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors. Yeah? What about Laura -- I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games? Hey! You don't know me -- So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood? There's only so much technology can do. (picks up his tool box) Thanks for the beer. Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt... I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.  Goddamn it, Stephen... I'm Brian. I'm in heaven, Lt. Hey! Hey, I think it's coming from a different staircase. I got one! I got somebody! I got somebody! Is she... Is she alive? Shit... Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right now. -- C'mon, Stephen. Goddamn it Stephen! -- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did! My Lt. might have something to say about that.  John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...  -- Never mind. This is your city job? Have you guys got something against dalmatians? Do you have to do that? Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning. What's going on? Thanks. Hey.  With grenadine, right? Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun? Carrying Swayzak's notebook? Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy? -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt. What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard. I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II. What?  What's going on? Yeah. Big fan. Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman. No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin. Every little boy's fantasy. I have a job. Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young. Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire engines sorta run in my family. Politics don't. C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth. So now you suddenly care about my future? Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them. You don't need a drink, man. You need to get outta here... So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what? C'mon, let's crawl home.  This? Having fun, fireman? What, are you kidding? By myself? What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time. No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me. Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna quit. You hear me! Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team... I waited... I would have fucking waited... Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance? You're right, Stephen... You win... You're the best, man... I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it. Yeah... Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant. Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere. I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city. Where are you going?  Hey, do I know you?  What the hell are you talking about my -- What do you want me to do with --  What are you listening to? Glass? -- Another backdraft. No it couldn't. I mean you'd be right -- with normal wire. But that's gauge ten in that plug -- industrial stuff. Who knows why they put it in here -- but it won't melt at less than 12,000 degrees. And no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot.  In another life I was in high-end electronics. Don't mention it. Hey, Tim.  So, you surviving without me? Swayzak's not my boss. Grindle, scrape down that wall for me, huh? I would myself, but the tie 'n all, y'know... Yeah? Where? Thanks for the insight. Just leave me alone, okay? Uh, I don't think that's in my contract... ""Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"" ""During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium"". Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder. And the putty around the door? But the right guess on this is arson. Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case. Arson. Hey. Boss and I are up to about three words an hour. I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here. Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...  Call ya back. Jesus! What? But he killed these guys. What reason? That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience? Are you going public with this?  Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what? Sorry.  Are you dating anyone? Well, you did invite me here. Nice boat. Okay. No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one. Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked. In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah. Thanks for the invite. Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies. This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think? See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know? When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman. I wanted to be a good one. Old firehouse trick. Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose. This is a six inch playpipe, cast bronze to keep it firm during hard flows. (picks up another item) This is our pipe extender, used in forward lays...  This is our hard suction line... Our adjustable insertion nozzle... (comes around back of trunk) ...And this is the hose bed. Excuse us. Is he... Do they think he'll pull through? I should have been there. You had to do it, didn't you? Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen? He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him. You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news. -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers -- -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.  Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""? Leave Stephen out of this -- -- I work for the city. Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight. I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot. Backdraft? Fire. Somewhere between zero and no way. Go talk to the building owner. Our book lists the owner as Dekom Trust.  Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb. So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants... Nice bunch of guys. Hi. Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden. You could check. It'd be in his files. Yes. Your boss is lying, Jennifer. Jennifer? What is -- I'm sorry. You're right. Yeah? Airtight? I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along. Then who wrote the report? How ya feeling? Did you pull me out? Did I say thanks? Just wondering. So what do you want me to do? I'm close... but I can't get who it is... Who's doing this? Then who -- I don't have a story. What? I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal. -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything... The outlets. Trychticholorate. Who the fuck is doing this?  Who's doing this? Oh Jesus Christ... Oh goddamn it Stephen... Just... Just wanted to say hello... You're selling dad's boat? I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do. Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other -- It's okay, Stephen, I -- I saw it. When dad died, I saw another fire... I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die. I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on... Sometimes right when you're looking at them. Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?  -- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's -- I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people! How do you know? -- What were they doing there? What are we going to do about this? We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen. Oh, Christ. Stephen... Where are they? Where's 17? Stephen -- Did you do it for Tim? Just come down, John. Just -- -- He killed people -- -- Stephen, this is bullshit -- You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen? ""You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"" Stephen! NO! You're gonna be all right, man. Hey! Over here! No... No more. Another time, friend. I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't. Oh man, don't you die... Don't you die... Goddamn it don't you die now... Not now! Yeah. Like it never happened... See that glow flashing in the corner of your eye? That's your career dissipation light. And it just went into high gear. I think your boss is going to need some spin control.  What'll you do? I'll see ya around, huh? You're doing it wrong."
changeling,CHRISTINE ,Angelina Jolie," Walter...time for school, honey. Sorry, champ. You can sleep in all you want tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are for. Now hurry up or your breakfast will get cold. We're here, sweetie.   Come on. Okay Sandy, what's the prob-- Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor, ma'am, what can I --  Yes, I can see that you're on a party line, ma'am, what can I --  I know, it's unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in on party lines. We hope to have private lines installed by --  Well, what's he doing when you're on the phone?  Are you sure? Maybe there's a problem with the phone line. He could be asthmatic, or --  Oh. No, I...I've never heard of anything like that before either. Guess there's a first time for everything, right? No, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or... themselves. I'm sorry. I -- Unfortunately that was part of the problem. If you'll excuse me.... Hey, sport. So how was school? What happened? Did you hit him back?  Good. Rule number one: Never start a fight, but always finish it. So why did he hit you? Wait...you hit him first?  Why? Your dad never even had a chance to meet you...so how could he not like you? Well, the same day you were born, something else arrived. It came in the mail, in a box just slightly bigger than you. You know what was in that box?  Something called responsibility. Now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it's what you live your whole life for. Other people think it's the scariest thing in the world. Yup. That's what I thought. Walter, I decided a long time ago that I would always tell you the truth, that I would treat you like a grown-up. I can't expect you to respect me unless I respect you.  I've never lied to you. Your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box. Pinky-swear. First one to the corner store gets ice cream! I'm afraid so, sport.   Come on now, time for bed. Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin playing down at Grauman's, and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman. I don't know. Nobody does. That's what makes him so mysterious. Not for years yet, Walter.     Not for years. Hello?  Oh, hello, Margaret. I'm fine, thanks. No, I was just --  You're kidding. When did she call in sick?  What about Myrna? I know she could use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's just...I promised Walter I'd take him to the movies today. There has to be somebody else....  All right, I...guess we can do it tomorrow. I'll get there as soon as I can. But just until four, okay? See you in a bit. There's a sandwich and milk in the icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours, just to -- Of course you can. She's coming by to check on the house, not you. Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies. Then we'll ride the Big Red down to Santa Monica and walk on the pier. How's that? That okay?  Good. I'll be back before it gets dark. I know you're not, honey. That's how I raised you.  Be good. See you in a bit. All right, get me the Omaha routing station, see if we can put the calls through their switchers...and let's get that console running.... Thank you, Mr. Harris, but I -- That's great, Mr. Harris, I really appreciate the vote of confidence. I'm sorry, but I really have to go. We'll talk on Monday. Good night! She races out to Wait...wait...hold on, just a -- Walter? Walter...? Walter?   Honey? Time to come in. Susie honey, have you seen Walter? Mrs. Riley, I'm sorry to bother you at dinnertime, but I was wondering if Walter was here. Do you know if Jamie was able to look in on him? I'm sure it's fine, I just...  Thank you, Mrs. Riley. Walter...?     Walter.... She starts walking again. Faster now. Looking around trees and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide. She hears children playing. Laughing. She picks up her pace, homing in on the sound. Yes, Operator, give me the police. Yes, hello, my name is Christine Collins, I live at 210 North Avenue 23...I'm calling to report a missing child...it's my son, he.... I'm not sure...I just got home from work and...it could be since late this morning, it could be just an hour -- Yes, of course, I -- No, he always stays around the house when it starts to get dark. Can you please send someone down here? POLICE DISPATCHER I'm sorry, but our policy is that we don't dispatch units on missing child cases for twenty-four hours. What?   But that's -- That's not Walter, he doesn't do that. Please, I -- The police are doing all they can, and frankly I could use the money. It's been almost a month, and...it wouldn't do any good to find Walter and bring him home if he doesn't have a home to come back to, right? Excuse me, can I have your attention? Listen, everyone, I appreciate your consideration, but I'm not made of porcelain. I won't break down and cry if the station to station call to Kankakee doesn't go through.  Actually, I...promised myself that I wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself cry...until I knew, one way or another, what....  Point is...I like the noise here. So don't be afraid to talk and...push buttons, and drop things. If it wasn't noisy, how would I know I was in the right place? -- well, if you do hear anything, would you let me know? Thanks, I appreciate it. Goodbye. Missing Persons department, please.  Yes, hello, this is Christine Collins, I...yes, fine, thank you. I was just checking back to see if you had found any missing or lost children that might match the --  I see. No, I appreciate that, it's just...it never hurts to make sure all the lines of communication are working. I mean, that's what I do for a living, right?  Well, I'll try back next week. If you do hear anything in the meantime, would you be sure to let me know? Thanks. Goodbye. Missing persons department, please. All these reporters...you didn't tell me -- Oh, my, I didn't expect -- Oh...yes, of course, they've been great. Well, there was that part about having to wait twenty-four hours before filing a report, but -- Yes...other than that, no complaints. They've all been wonderful. Walter...Walter! He's not my son. He's not my son.  He's not my son. Mistaken? I know my own son. It's a common name, it -- It's not Walter. A trial basis? I...look, I'll take him home, but only because I...might not be thinking clearly right now, and -- It was...it's...hard to explain. I -- Was the sandwich all right?  Would you like some more milk? No, thank you. ""WALTER"" No, thank you. Now you need a bath. You're covered with soot from the train ride. I found you a pair of pajamas. I bought them for Walter but he didn't like the fabric, so -- Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself?     Let me see -- ...circumcised.... The last time I measured Walter -- the last time I measured my son -- he was four inches taller than you are right now.  Who are you?  What are you doing here?  Who are you? He's not my son. I don't know who he is, or why he's saying he's Walter, but there's clearly been some kind of mistake. He's four inches shorter than Walter. Boys his age don't shrink. If anything, he should be taller. He's circumcised. Walter wasn't. Made him smaller? Captain, please -- -- why won't you listen to me? Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce back as my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof. I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter. But you haven't found him. He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt.... Oh...yes, of course. Thank you for coming. I'm surprised Captain Jones moved so quickly. I was starting to think he didn't believe me. Doctor Tarr, I thought you were here to help me. My ""motherly concern"" isn't for him because he's not my son. He's four inches shorter than -- What about the circumcision? Look, doctor -- Wouldn't I know whether or not he was my son? I'm his mother. What're you -- Dr. Tarr -- Before we go...Mrs. Riley, do you have the time? Thank you. This is absolutely outrageous! Captain, I...no, listen to me, this so-called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who couldn't even recognize her own --  He found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find, but it's not --  No, I am not reassured. I thought we had an understanding, I --  That I was embarrassed isn't the issue, the point is you're wasting time when you should be looking for my son, I --  Then I want to see this report, so I can refute it, before it goes to anyone else, all right? Fine. Yes.   Go on up. Stop saying that! I'm not your mother! And you're not my son! She moves toward him, her anger coming out at last. WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY SON BACK! I was wrong to yell at you. You're still a child, and I think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing. Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but I need you to understand. Walter is...he's all I have, he's everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where I can help him.  Whatever the police think, whatever the world thinks, we know the truth, don't we? We both know you're not Walter. Getting you to admit that may be the only chance I have to straighten this out before it's too late. Maybe you're afraid of getting in trouble, that you're in too deep. But you're not. You don't have to tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you're not. Just... tell them the truth. Hello? Yes?   Who is this? Oh, yes, I heard some of your radio broadcasts after my son...you were very supportive, and I appreciate -- No, I -- ""Acting on the request of the Los Angeles Police Department, Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child specialist, examined Walter Collins to determine the cause of his loss of weight, paleness, confusion and run-down condition noticed since the return of the boy to his mother last Saturday.""  ""I examined the boy quite thoroughly, Dr. Tarr said -- Captain Jones promised he'd let me see the report before it went anywhere else. Why are they doing this? Thank you. I've been trying to get someone to say those words since...god, I was starting to think I was losing my mind.  Thank you. At least someone believes me. Reverend Briegleb...I appreciate what you're saying, and what you're doing...but I'm not on a mission. The only thing I want is to find my son, that's all, and I just -- If they honestly thought I was wrong, that'd be one thing...but if they don't care, if they're just trying to cover it up.... What do I have to do? Well? And...? Does a gap like that get smaller with age? Because that's what they'll say. Will you be willing to sign a letter saying that officially? Well? What do you think? Is that the Walter Collins that you remember? Good morning. My name is Christine Collins. On March 10th, my nine year old son, Walter Collins, disappeared. A four month investigation resulted in a boy being brought to Los Angeles from De Kalb, Illinois. They told me, and all of you, that this boy was my son. They were wrong.  The Los Angeles Police Department made a mistake...a terrible mistake. The boy they found is not my son. That is the reason for the supposed ""transformation."" I have letters from his dentist, his teachers and others confirming that this boy is not my son. The letters are being reprinted now, and I should have them for you tomorrow. I have given the police department every opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son. Since they have refused to do so, I have no choice but to present my case before the public. I hope this will persuade the police to finish the job they started, and bring my son home to me.  Thank you. Why are we using the back door? Is it? She allows a moment of quiet satisfaction as she's led into It wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone. JONES No, of course not. You just told the papers we can't tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we spent working on your case. Are you trying to make fools out of us? Is that it? Do you enjoy this? No, of course not. I had to get your attention, I had to make you understand...he's not my son. That's not true! I don't know! All I know is that he's lying! Just a minute -- JONES Because either you know you're lying, or you're not capable of knowing if you're lying or telling the truth. So which is it, Mrs. Collins? Are you a derelict mother? Or just nuts? Because from where I sit, those are the only options. I'm not going to sit here and take this -- Yes. Wait...what are you doing? No...wait, you can't -- Wait...please, this is a mistake.  Please...you have to listen to me. The police are doing this to punish me. They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son, but it wasn't my son, and now they say I'm crazy -- Oh, god...oh god, please, no.... No, please, you have to listen to me...wait...please! Why? That's not necessary -- The morning? But...wait, I've got to talk to someone in authority -- Then if I could just use the phone. Wait...please! There's been a terrible mistake! I'm sorry, I -- Can I see the doctor?   Or someone in charge -- But I -- Christine.     Christine Collins. I won't be here that long. As soon as I can talk to a doctor, they'll realize there's been a terrible mistake and -- Then I'll just have to prove that I'm not insane. You seem to have given this a great deal of thought. What about you? But how can they -- Fine.   Thank you.  Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable. Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind. No. Not at all. I'm sure it's... standard procedure.  But...at the same time...I imagine that it would be...would probably be upsetting to...some people that someone else might...suspect that of them.  However inappropriate that might be. I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just...not the right boy.  They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing. People don't change, doctor. That's not what I -- No.    Of course not. That's right. What for? ORDERLY Medication. What kind of medication? I don't want to relax...I'm fine, and I won't take something unless I know what it is! Just listen -- Doctor...Doctor Steele -- I don't know what's going on, but I'm not taking anything until -- I don't have anything wrong with me that I should have to take medication. That's right. Yes. I won't sign it. I won't sign it! I was not wrong! That boy is not my son! And I am not going to stop telling the truth about this! And you're not going to stop me, and the police aren't going to stop me -- -- I will tear down the walls of this place with my bare hands if I have to, but one way or another -- STEELE Orderly! No! No, I won't let you!     Someone, please, help me! Carol!   No, leave her alone!    What're you -- Carol....! You shouldn't have done that. I won't...I won't. That's hardly appropriate language for a lady, now is it? And when's that? Fuck you....and the horse...you rode in on. No. ...what? Next door. I am out. I don't know...but I couldn't go without saying goodbye -- I will...but I want you to know: once I have my boy back, I'm coming back here...for you, and the others. This is wrong, and we can stop it -- Watch me. No...god...no.... A little better, thanks. The sleep helped. Anything new outside? I want to go home. I've been giving that a great deal of thought ever since I got out of that...place. All those women, and what they did about Walter....  They're going to just keep on doing it, aren't they? Nothing's going to change...unless we make it change. I used to tell Walter, ""Never start a fight...but always finish it."" I didn't start this fight...but by god I'm going to finish it. ""Always finish it. Always."" Hello. HAHN Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences on your loss. Yes...of course. Mr. Hahn, was it? I appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the...remains... as Walter's. Yes, but...I guess I still can't accept it. It doesn't feel real to me. I'm sorry.     Please, sit. I've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it's not necessary. Then we'll just have to hire a lawyer...bring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call for a hearing by the Welfare Board.  I see.... Of course. One thing, though. A personal favor. When we've finished here today, could you spare a few minutes to come with me downtown. HAHN Of course.     Where downtown? It's all right...everything's going to be all right now.... Reverend, what -- I don't understand. I see...well, I...thank you.   Can I get you anything? Where is all this traffic's coming from...? Briegleb glances back. The police car has popped its doors, and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine stops a man passing in the opposite direction. Excuse me, can you tell me what the problem is up ahead? He didn't mean...he couldn't mean -- Oh...my.... But...shouldn't we -- I'm up here, Reverend. When Walter was...when he was here, I'd walk past his bedroom when he was asleep, and even if I couldn't see him, or hear him, I could...feel him in here. That's why I don't think Walter is dead. I can still feel him, in this room. I know what the police said. But the remains...what they found on that ranch is so...most of it can't even be properly identified. What if that boy made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture? Maybe. And maybe he'd want me to keep looking. Maybe he's waiting for me, somewhere. Ten minute break? We'll see.     Thanks, Ben. Yes, hello, this is Christine Collins, we spoke yesterday about my son...fine, thank you. I was wondering if you'd had a chance to go through the file on runaways in your area in case anyone resembling Walter had --  I see. No, thank you, I appreciate the information. Would it be all right if I called you again, in a month or so? Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, hello, I was just -- From who? Why? No, I'm...sure I'll be fine. No, I don't smoke. That's where they do what? Mr. Northcott...you asked me to come to see you. You said if I did, you would tell me the truth about my son. Well, I'm here. Now what? What? Why not? Mr. Northcott...look at me.  Look at me. Did you...kill...my son? Mr. Northcott -- No, wait, please -- Did you kill him? Did you kill my son? Mr. Northcott...Mr. Northcott! Sandy, you guys blew out the phone lines between here and Baltimore, someone has to clean up the mess, and that's me. Besides, I've got a radio right here, I can follow the whole thing. Positive.    Go on, have fun. I said I can't go -- Ben, that's very sweet, and I wish I could...but I really need to stay and finish this. Ben...? I put down two dollars on ""It Happened One Night"" for best picture. Seems I'm the only one here who thinks it has a chance against ""Cleopatra."" If I win, how about we have dinner tomorrow night to celebrate? MR. HARRIS You've got a deal, Christine.   Good night. 'Night. I'll be here. Over-rated.... Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert.   I rest my case.  I knew it...I knew it!   I told you so! Ben, it looks like dinner is on me, I -- Yes, this is she. Mrs. Clay? No, of course I remember you, how are you? Is everything -- When? Where did they --  No, of course...I'll be right there. Are they sure it's -- But how -- I am. Why not? Three boys made a run for it that night, Detective. If one got out, maybe either or both of the others did too. Maybe Walter went through the same fears he did. Afraid to come home or identify himself, afraid he'd get into trouble, that people might think it was his fault. Either way, it gives me something I didn't have before tonight. Hope."
confidence,JAKE ,Edward Burns," And I think it's because of this redhead... The Anti-Christ? Gee... What makes you say that? Just the last three weeks. I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened. I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him! Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes. LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me! Help me. Come on. Grab his arms. Lionel... He's dead. Yeah, maybe you didn't pull the trigger, but you were standing right there and watched me do it. Help me. Grab his arms. If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up. Then shut up. Relax, porkchop. Then go. What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now? Stop waving that thing around. And you know I hate guns. I told you, use less powder. Then these go into your cut. Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill. What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you? What? I can feel you looking at me. Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back. Ten percent. Confidence. It's just confidence. What are you talking about? Ten's standard. We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite? All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack. We can't all be model citizens such as yourself. Isn't it always? It's what makes us run. And despite what they say, it can buy you love. It can buy you a new and better you. It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist. It can make you think you're on top of the world. And if you believe that money can do all that for you, you're the perfect mark. Jack Kerouac said that if you own a rug, you own too much. I don't necessarily like Kerouac and driving cross country isn't exactly my idea of a good time, but the guy's got a point... If you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose. And when it comes to money, finding it and losing it, you always gotta remember how much of it's just luck... Dumb fucking luck. Yeah. Miles... Big Al used to send money to his Father, some Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind in a VA hospital in Cleveland. Al was like that. That's why Al never played the Inside. Well, this is just fucking great... A bird flew into my house last night. It's bad luck. He'll find us. We go talk to him. You know what we're doing with the money. Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too. The Euclid was our place. Gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot in a card game. We used it every now and then for a rag, but mostly it was our office. Our Power Point. That's it? Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you. Tonight. Just me. Meet me at my place later. I'm getting a ride. I try. You the one that did it? You the one that got Al?  Uh... Which one's the King Pin? Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there. I have a good crew. Minus one. I guess it lacks a certain style. You can't cheat an honest man. I apologize for the inconvenience. I can't do that. Let me rephrase -- I won't do that. Because you killed one of my crew. I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square. No. Just confidence. We got caught. So you know it won't happen again. Why? I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley. Just a tip. You never know when you can use a crooked cop. So you want to know how to play the Big Con. First thing about being on the grift... You're only as good as your Mark. The Roper's the guy who finds them. They all have money one way or another. Some of them come from money. There's that saying -- Show me an honest man and I'll show you a natural born liar. There's always that little bit of bad no matter how much good. It's that little itch on the back of you neck. You may not even know it's there, but it is. A good Roper knows how to scratch it -- You the outdoorsy-type? ""I was just fly fishing out in Montana"". You play the market? ""I just got a tip on a tech start-up IPO."" You saw ""the 'Riverdance' twice? I had a roommate in college who was gay."" Whatever... It means that in fifteen minutes we're on good terms. Thirty, I'm your buddy. In an hour, I'm your best friend. Give me a day and you'll let me do your wife and daughter at the same time. It's too late for you... I have your confidence. I tell you the ""Tale"" -- It's the story of how we're going to make easy money. No one gets hurt. And here's the guy who's going to help. That's when you meet the Insideman. The Insideman's the one with the know-how, the scoop, the angle. But maybe you're the suspicious type. So I give you the ""Convincer."" We both put up a little and we get a little back. Just a taste. Just enough that when I tell you we can make more off of it, you agree. That's when I put you on the ""Send."" You put in a little, you got a little. Put in a lot... I ""send"" you out for more. As much as you can get. Doesn't matter what the con is. Insider trading, a line we got on a bookie club, insurance scam, whatever... You saw the money and you want it. More of it. Who cares if you have to bend the rules a little? As long as no one gets hurt. Then someone does...  Frankie Suits always said, that what you have to understand about any confidence game, is that it's like putting on a play where everyone knows their part... The Roper, the Insideman, the Shills... Everyone except for the Mark.  Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.  You should be running out the door, desperate to forget this ever happened, ready to repent your greedy ways!  Then there it is again... That little itch. There's a guy holding a smoking gun, a guy bleeding all over the floor and still, all you can think about is the money. You twisted fuck. So we gotta give you the ""Blow-off"". We make sure that you never, ever want to look for us again. We get you off our backs. Forever. And that's why you need the ""Fix""... The New York Police Department's finest. Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer. We're working for the King. No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill. Breasts.  Oops. We're not cops. Yes, her. Where's my wallet?  You interested in a little work? Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right? You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me. We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up. Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job. We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious. I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before? You get an equal cut. Just play a part. A little acting. That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark. Morgan Gillette. Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect... His grandfather used to run liquor during prohibition and his father made a bundle in illegal importing and exporting. That makes him a third generation crook. He's been tied into pretty much everything; drugs, mob, money rinsing... There's a story going around that he helped fund the Contras back in the eighties. Most of his money's clean. A lot of it isn't. The best part is that we know exactly where it is. Two million. We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King. That's why we don't go after him directly. We find a doable guy in Gillette's bank... Someone about mid-level. Not too high, not too low. We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need. We pay better. Our guy gets us approved for the start up capital. But, the money can't be transferred to any one person. On the given day, the money's wired into a corporate account in an off-shore bank. That same day, I show up in the Caymens with the proper I.D. and corporate papers to make a withdrawal. What? Good point. It's bank policy not to release this money in cash because it's under a corporate account. So we cash the check at another bank. Now, this is the most important part -- You can't just walk into the United States with a suitcase full of cash without evoking the words ""cavity search"". That's why you need someone on the inside at Customs. Then we disappear. It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs. Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run? Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before. We're getting a little old for running. I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo? No, not ""whatever."" You're either in or you're out. I agreed with Miles. It was, hands down, a dumb fucking idea. But they bought it. Now I had to deliver and I needed help.  Yeah, it's Jake. How'd that tip work out? Factors that weren't clear to me until now. Let me tell you something about Moonan... He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars. Just watch every thing you say around him. Every word, every move... It all goes back to the King Pin. Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance... No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker. I'll worry about Customs. Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something. I think two million. I need you to stake me. I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here. No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape. Excuse me? Fine. You want me to take it off, I'll take it off. You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you? No thanks. I'm good. I am not going -- I think I just broke my hand. You get all that? We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank. What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit. Guy like me, with people like that... I'll tell you what you're looking for without even meeting you. It's like a personal ad you wear over your head. No. No. No. What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's got nothing to lose. No friends, no family, no life. You're looking for a guy who doesn't own a rug. Him. I'm sure. Now we had the con and the mark. We needed to look the part... Frankie Suits was a legend in certain circles. He was on the grift since he was ten. Back in the day, Suits made money running fight stores and the wire with a Fix so tight it was like a legit business. I never understood what the point was if grifting became like a regular job. We need wardrobe. Aces, Suits. Pretty much. Pretty much. Huh? Oh. She's alright. A little bit of both. Can't say. The King. I can handle it. It's not history. I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it. Yes I can. Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one. We're Jake. Don't worry about it. You need to get a haircut. And some new clothes. We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can. I don't trust anyone.  Oh yeah. This is good. This will do nicely.  This is about confidence. Your confidence and their confidence. You get their confidence by giving them yours. Mr. Lewis? It is you. Hello! Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice. Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis? Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson. You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson. My wife and I are just taking a little vacation. Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily. I'm sorry, honey. I'm almost done. Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her? Very much so. I told you. My wallet was stolen. Please... Check again. Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?  That'd be a great help. You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster. A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one. Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks? I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..? I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...  This is embarrassing. I'm sorry, sir. Thank you very much for doing this. And please tell Carolyn hello for me. Happy anniversary. Smile. You just got a present from the man of your dreams. Now we gotta give him a strong finish. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It was all in play. Everything... Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match? Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck. Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad. Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.  But if you wanna talk about bad luck... Redheads. FUCK! Top three all-time worst red-heads... Lizzie Borden... Axe murder. Judas... Betrayer. Shirley Vig... Abandoner. You just put a mother of a jinx on us. But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house... A bird enters your house... It means death. You have no idea what you've done do you? No idea! What is this?  What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead! Like that matters! You can't fool bad luck! You can't get by on a technicality! You can't trick karma! Anybody says a word I swear to God... My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million. She's up for it. She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean. So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, ""You're fired! Your whole team's fired!"" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo -- Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses. What do you do over at your bank, Grant? Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing. Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan. A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part. They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course. We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22  Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com? Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan. Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.  Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little. Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help. Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off. Lupus! When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al. I'll find the time. For what? A couple hundred bucks? It's what I do. It's my job. Are you asking me if I have something to prove? Not in that repressed anger sort of way. Good quality porn has it's place in the world. I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it. Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would. No. You have another part? You'll know what to do. Intuition.  Don't ruin this for me. You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden. Then she fucked him over with an apple.  Redheads...  How do you deal with --  I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that? Maybe. Even if we don't, you'll be alright. You're not in the hole with the King. Sounds respectable. You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now? Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me. You guys got busted. This is a great neck. Glenn talked you out of it. He was looking out for you. Lily... Jesus Christ... Did, uh... Did you kill him? No. You trusted him... You were just getting square. Sorry, honey. But I figure if we can't all share at a time like this... We had to finalize the deal. This has to happen fast. There'll be red flags. You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer. You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you. Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch. The standard ten. Two million. And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow. Eight A.M. flight. We'll use the Euc. That tip not work-out for you fellas? Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business. Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther. Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks. Wouldn't dream of it.  Something stupid. We go way back... About four years ago, we were working in Miami, turf fixing for some local goon. Turns out this local goon was being watched by the Feds, which means we were being watched by the Feds. One in particular. Special Agent Gunther Moonan. He didn't really have anything on us, but I figure, maybe this guy's good for a Fix. So I ask him out to dinner. These guys we have now, sure, give them twenty bucks and they'll look the other way on a parking ticket. But a Fed... You get a guy like that as your Fix... It was probably a stupid idea. There I am, Armani and Rolex. There he is, JC Penny and Timex... So I took a shot. But now he had me on attempted bribery of a Federal Agent. That's when Gordo comes in with the Hazelnut French Roast. And that's how Special Agent Gunther Moonan and I became friends. No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time. There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk. What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up. No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers! Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there? Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either. There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over. What about what? So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology? I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut. That's it. Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet. Of what? They're both crooks. My fucking heart bleeds. Point, Lupus. Give us a point. I was doing it for them. It's not true. No. She won't. She's not going to be a problem. Uh huh... Uh huh... Okay... I understand. Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck. Aww, shit! We were back on. She walked. Sorry. I didn't know... Today? Started off great... Ashby was going to call us with the exact time of the transfer. The King was waiting on us. Just to be safe... Gordo went down to the Caymens instead of me. I needed Rottovich and Sobozinski to keep Moonan off our backs and the only way I could do that was to stay in town and cut them in on the deal. So they waited for my call while Miles and I waited for Ashby's call. Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light. And we got rid of the red head. They say a good chess player can see up to twenty moves deep. That means that in some games, you've calculated every possible move in your head... The game's over before it's even really started. Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep. In order to ensure that we weren't going to welch, Ashby's pay-off was to be directly deposited into his own offshore account which he could confirm electronically. In this age of e-commerce, paper currency has become more of a liability than a commodity. Especially to us.  Go. Gordo was making the withdrawal from the Grand Laymen's Bank. They check the papers... ...They stick. Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens... We called them Green Twinkies. Miles was on his way to the airport to wait for Gordo to land. I made the call. Yeah, it's me. I need an escort. Not a ride, just an escort. You wanted in, this is in. Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control? Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here. Gordo. What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane! He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this? That was fucking deep. What's up with you? Bladder infection? It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it. That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different. Egg Foo Young.  Stand up. Stand up. I said stand up. This is probably about where you came in. Eww-Whoa?  Eee Oott Auught! HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched! Aaaaiiit!!! Ooopusss!! I never thanked you for that. What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right? Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government. It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark. Guess so. I do trust you, Lily. Trust... It should be a four letter word. So I'm dead... But maybe I can't blame Lily. Maybe I just should have just trusted her to play her part. Because playing the big con is like putting on a play. A play where everyone knows their part except for the Mark... Just watch everything you say around him. Every word, every move... It all goes back to the King Pin. Get it? You have no idea what you've done do you? No idea! What is this? You tell them the ""Tale"". What do you want? An apology? And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head... Then you give them the ""Blow-off"". You get them off your back. Forever. But most of all, you need the ""Fix"". That's how Special Agent Gunther Moonan and I became friends. Like Suits said, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Rottovich and Sobozinski would ask how the drugs got in that suitcase. The King and Gillette would ask where the money really went. And all of them would ask what agency Special Agent Gunther Moonan worked for. But what do I care? I'm dead... No one's going to ask me. Drop something? Redheads..."
shrek,SHREK ,Mike Myers," Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast. This is the part where you run away.  And stay out! (looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) ""Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.""(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.) Aye? Oh, really? You and what army? Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa! Oh, that's great. Really. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? Why are you following me? Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends. Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I? No! I'm an ogre! You know. ""Grab your torch and pitchforks."" Doesn't that bother you? Really? Oh. Uh, Shrek. That would be my home. I like my privacy. Uh, what? Of course! No. Okay! Okay! But one night only. What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No! Oh! Outside! I thought I told you to stay outside. Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder.) Ow! Enough!  What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table. Huh? I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy? (He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, no. No! No! What are you doing in my swamp? (this echoes and everyone falls silent.) All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey) What? By who? All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all? Anyone? Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! You! You're comin' with me. What did I say about singing? No. All right, hum it. So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.) Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The attendant runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc.) It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?  No. No. No, no, no! No. All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.  Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey. Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint? No? All right then. Come on! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! What? Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! Exactly the way it was? And the squatters? What kind of quest? You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you? For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think. Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. Yes - - No! No! No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he heaves a sigh and then walks off) I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later. You know, I think I preferred your humming. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.  It's brimstone. We must be getting close. Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs...then the laugh turns into a groan) Oh, aye. Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves. You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time. Really, really. Just keep moving. And don't look down. But you're already halfway. Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back. Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the bridge) Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces the bridge again) Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across the bridge) You said do it! I'm doin' it. That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks towards the castle) Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. No. Shh. Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs. The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. I read it in a book once. Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the... Donkey, look out! (he manages to get a hold of the dragons tail and holds on) Got ya! Wake up! Are you Princess Fiona? Oh, that's nice. Now let's go! Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? I don't think so. Uh, Shrek. Thanks! It's on my to-do list. Now come on! (takes off running and drags Fiona behind him.) Yeah, right before they burst into flame. Well, I have to save my ass. One of a kind. (opens the door into the throne room) Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. Oh! Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon. Run! Uh, no. I have helmet hair. No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st. What?  That wasn't in the job description. Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet. Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. I'm not going to. No! Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who wants to marry you. Good question. You should ask him that when we get there. You're not making my job any easier. Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right?  I'm a delivery boy. (he swiftly picks her up and swings her over his shoulder like she was a sack of potatoes) Ya comin', Donkey? Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the ""measuring"" when you see him tomorrow. No, that'll take longer. We can keep going. Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest. Hey! Over here. Homey touches? Like what? (he hears a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona who has torn the bark off of a tree.) I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding. And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for. No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench. You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it. Our swamp? We? Donkey, there's no ""we"". There's no ""our"". There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land. No, do ya think? Never mind, Donkey. No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things. Why do you want to talk about it? I'm not blocking. Donkey, I'm warning you. Everyone! Okay? Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff and sits down) Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone. Yeah, I know. Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. That's the moon. Donkey, wake up. Wake up. What's all this about? Uh, thanks. What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. You know, you're not exactly what I expected. Princess! Hey! That's my princess! Go find you own! Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from? That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that? What?  Oh, would you look at that? (he goes to pull it out but flinches because it's tender) Donkey, I'm okay. What are the flowers for? Ah. Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'. No, it's tender. What you're doing is the opposite of help. Look, time out. Ow! Ow! Not good. Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall over with Fiona on top of him) Nothing happend. We were just, uh - - Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just- -  Ugh! (he turns to look at Fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile) Ow! There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you. Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move on. What? You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down? Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner. Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style. Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weed rat stew. Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it. Um, Princess? I, um, I was wondering...are you... Are you gonna eat that? What? Good night. Oh, what are you talkin' about? You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm - - Yeah. An ogre. To get... move firewood. Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh... I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go. Perfect! Never been better. You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last night. Every word. Oh, I understand. Like you said, ""Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"" Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at him in shock. He looks past her and spots a group approaching.) Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something. As promised. Now hand it over. Yeah? So what? I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home? I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues with what he's doing.) What are you doing? Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it. Oh! Your half. Hmm. Back off! This is my swamp!  Let go, Donkey! Stubborn jackass! Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks away) Well, I'm through with you. Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back! (goes into the outhouse and slams the door) Go away! Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking. She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about? Donkey! Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me? Right. Friends? So, um, what did Fiona say about me? The wedding! We'll never make it in time. Donkey? Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a noogie) What are you talking about? I don't have time for this! Yes. Yes. Yes! All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line? What do you see? Oh, for the love of Pete! I object!  Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first of all. Very clean. Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding... Fiona! I need to talk to you. But you can't marry him. Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king. He's not your true love. Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona smiles) No, no! No! Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! Fiona! Uh, Fiona? I - - I love you. Really, really. Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right? But you ARE beautiful."
platoon,CHRIS ,Charlie Sheen," Ants.  I got ants on my neck ...  I'm okay ... I'm okay.  Somebody once wrote Hell is the impossibility of Reason.  That's what this place feels like.  I hate it already and it's only been a week.  Some goddamn week, grandma ...  ... the hardest thing I think I've ever done is to go on point, 3 times this week - I don't even know what I'm doing.  A gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired.  We get up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m., dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or a 3-man listening post in the jungle.  It's scary cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't even want to know your name.  The unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer that much.  I can believe that ... If you're lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4 hours a night, but you don't really sleep ... I don't think I can keep this up for a year, grandma - I think I've made a big mistake coming here ...  No ...  Yeah she's real pretty, you're lucky ...  Uh hunh.  Sure.  Yeah.  Hey Tex - you're ten minutes fast. Junior! Shaddup!  You're snoring ... Shhh.  ... 'Course Mom and Dad didn't want me to come, they wanted me to be just like them - respectable, hard- working, making $200 a week, a little house, a family.  They drove me crazy with their goddamn world, grandma, you know Mom, I don't want to be a white boy on Wall Street, I don't want my whole life to be predetermined by them. ... I guess I have always been sheltered and special, I just want to be anonymous.  Like everybody else. Do my share for my country.  Live up to what Grandpa did in the First War and Dad the Second.  I know this is going to be the war of my generation.  Well here I am - anonymous all right, with guys nobody really cares about - they come from the end of the line, most of 'em, small towns you never heard of - Pulaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend, Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania.  Two years' high school's about it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for 'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing, they're poor, they're the unwanted of our society, yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom and what we call America, they're the bottom of the barrel - and they know it, maybe that's why they call themselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can take anything.  They're the backbone of this country, grandma, the best I've ever seen, the heart and soul - I've found it finally, way down here in the mud - maybe from down here I can start up again and be something I can be proud of, without having to fake it, maybe ... I can see something I don't yet see, learn something I don't yet know ... I miss you, I miss you very much, tell Mom I miss her too - Chris. Wake up! It's your shift, man ...  I'm hit ...  Doc ... tell me the truth, don't lie to me.  I was not ... it was your ... Do you ... do you know you're gonna die ... Big Harold? ... do you feel like ... like ... everything's gonna be fine and then ... It's not ... so bad ... dying.  How long .. it ...  I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant, Junior ... Okay - got light duty, three days. What you got there - beers?  Uh, looks like it? I got light duty, Sarge.  Doctor said to take it easy couple days. ... 32. 332 days. I volunteered. Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam ... Didn't make much sense.  Wasn't learning anything ...  And why should just the poor kids go to the war - and the college kids get away with it. Nah ... No, thanks ... Don't feel it. ... you know that night we got hit ... I ...  I think I'm starting to feel that stuff ... What are the heads? What? Yeah.  Yeah.  No pain in my neck now.  Feels good.  ... But what'd she do? But what'd she actually do? God! Elizabeth? Jennifer?  Dawn ... New Year's Day, 1968.  Just another day.  Staying alive.  There's been a lot of movement neat the Cambodian border, regiments of NVA moving across.  A lot of little firefights, ambushes, we drop a lot of bombs, then we walk through the napalm like ghosts in a landscape ... Where? We had to get to the village before dark so we left Elias with some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers ... But it was King who found him ... about 1000 yards downriver, not far from the village - It was the end of the mystery. ... the village, which had stood for maybe a thousand years, didn't know we were coming that day.  If they had they would have run ... Barnes was at the eye of our rage - and through him, our Captain Ahab - we would set things right again.  That day we loved him La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE! They're scared?  What about me!  I'm sick of this shit man, I""m sick of this shit!  They don't want us here!  Who do you think they're fighting for!  GET OUTTA THERE! Get up out of there! ... You see I didn't wanna hurt you.  Why didn't you come out, when I said so hunh! Why? WHY! WHY? DON'T YOU LISTEN ... WHAT ARE YOU SMILING AT HUNH! FUCKING ASSHOLES!  DANCE YOU ONE-LEGGED MOTHERFUCKER, DANCE!!! LET HER GO!  YOU HEAR ME!  YOU ASSHOLE!  LET HER GO! NO - YOU STUPID FUCK ... DON'T ... DON'T ... YOU TOO BUNNY.  MOREHOUSE.  OFF!  NO!  DON'T ... DON'T!  It's okay ... it's okay ...  It's okay, it's okay ... Where's he form? And he still wanted to come back? Does he have a metal plate in his head? Where's Elias come from? Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes ... ... I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time. ... beautiful night. That's a nice way of putting it. Barnes got it in for you, don't he? And you, do you believe?  You really think so ... us? Do you believe that stuff about ... knowing you're gonna die? ... You ever think about reincarnation, all that stuff? What's going on? Who's on point?  Where's Lerner? Oh Jesus! Lerner!  Lerner, can you hear me man? Gator!  Gator!  I'm gonna get you out man.  You're gonna be okay Gator ... okay? Take care of him Doc!  Please! Hang tough, Gator.  Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK ... just hang on. I'll go with you. GET EM!!!!!  Yeah!  I got two of them fuckers ... ... See them go down?  Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie!!  Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick! ... Crawford! Oh man!  ... man!  ... but 'Lias is still out there.  He's dead!  Where?  ... You saw him? He killed him.  I know he did.  I saw his eyes when he came back in ... Proof's in the eyes.  When you know you know.  You were there Rhah - I know what you were thinking.  I say we frag the fucker.  Tonight. Then what do you suggest big shot? Fuck this shit! You're wrong man!  Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer. I was wrong. KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!! They sent us back into the valley the next day - about 2,000 metres from Cambodia - into a battalion perimeter.  Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force and Charlie Company had been probed that night.  There were other battalions in the valley, we weren't the only ones but we knew we were going to be the bait to lure them out.  And somewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA Regiment. ... there's nobody. Who gives a shit! Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it? Not just me ... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it!  We just don't add up to dry shit. Hey that's great King, that's great ... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King ... got your address right?  You know where you can reach men, man.  Anytime! I'll walk you out ... Uh sure ... Trip flares! ... Rodriguez's hole. RPGs!  Shit! Over here! Rhah!  What's going on.  Rodriguez's hole just got Hold it!  WHO IS IT! No! It's the ambush!  In here, man!  Hurry. You go. Oh no! There!  Out of the hole!  Fast!  Goddamit Francis!  Move your fucking ass.  Now ... THEY GONNA BLOW IT! DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!! YAAAAAAAAA!!!  DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!! Barnes! Nooooooooo! Yeah.  How 'bout you?  You bet. I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us ... The war is over for me now, but it will always be there - the rest of my days.  As I am sure Elias will be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called possession of my soul ... There are times since I have felt like the child born of those two fathers ... but be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life"
brazil,SAM ,Jonathan Pryce,"Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is it?  The electronics here are up the spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry sir - I'll be there. Jack! Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem? You sound worried. Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late. Even later. Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins. Really? - God, how time flies! It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle. It's not our mistake! Information Retrieval. Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer Don't worry. I've told you before. I'd turn it down. Really.  What a BITCH!  I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.nan Huh! My God, it works. You're not listening, mother. What is it? Are we? Mother, I thought we were going to be able to talk .... Oh God, she's got what's he name with her.  A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...  I don't know which numero.  Mother, will you listen to  This isn't rare! Look - please - I'm sorry - but honestly, mother, this is - What? Now? It's my lunch hour.  Mother! Stop this!  I'm not being promoted. I'm not going to Information Retrieval! (he scrumples promotion notification which he has been holding and throws it on the floor) If I want you to stick your oar in, mother, I'll tell you where to stick it! Look - I've got to get back - I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.  NO, NOTHING. NOT EVEN DREAMS! I'm taking you to a safe place. A place where they will never be able to get at us ... ever. There's no way they can approach us without being seen. You're safe here.  Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning This is an emergency! Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer What? How do you know my name?  Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...  What? You mean you've got ... What do I have to do. Hello ... hello ... Who's that?  What? Who is this? What is this?  Who the hell are you? Tuttle! Are you from Central Services? But ... I called Central Services. What? Wait a minute, what was that business with the gun? Are you saying this is illegal? Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services? The pace?  Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount Can you fix it? Fine. No. Wait here. Yes? Uh - what? - I ...  No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed. I mean it fixed itself. Look, I'm sorry about your wasted journey No you can't. Just a minute! Have you got a 27B/6? Have you got one or haven't you?  I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?  Thank you. Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be - What do they want you or? Thank you very much. How much will it...? All clear. Hey that's a dead end. What have we got on today?  A cheque.  Tuttle? I've never seen a Ministry cheque before. Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque. Hang on. He is dead. Try next of kin. There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque? Into memory. Now ... Central Banking ... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit Problem. She doesn't have a bank account. You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option. Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop. I'll do it for you. Authorise the cheque. What's the address? Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.  Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.  Here. That's it.  Don't mention it. See you later.  Excuse me. Can you tell me ... Mrs Buttle  Uh, Mrs Buttle? Mrs Buttle ... Are you Mrs Buttle? My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I'm from the Ministry of Information.  I've come to give you a cheque.  It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.  Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human. Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms. Um ... Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid I don't know anything about it ... I'm really just delivering the cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind signing these receipts (producing blue and pink receipts) I'll go and leave you in peace. Uh ...  It's you ... it's you ... Wait! Stop! Come back!! Girl ... fair hair ...  Wait! It was nothing to do with me! Go away. What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who? Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?  He will be pleased when he comes home.  A ""personnel"" transporter? They've got it wrong. I had a personal transporter. I'll do the paperwork tomorrow - I delivered it. Yes. Damn! Blast! You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you? I know that.  I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I? I never signed the form. What! Shit! Yes ... No ... I don't, know. What the - ? How did you - ?  I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here. What is it? What? I fixed it myself. Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this! Er ... Thanks ... Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually - Oh, right ...  Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago. Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.  Mother? Is that you? Is Mr Helpmann here? I want to talk to him. Actually, I've decided ...  Congratulations ... Really?  Whatever happened to you?  Actually, there's someone I want to meet ... I ... uh ... Can I get you a drink, Shirley? Look ... Shirley ... your mother ... and my mother ... they seem to have got the idea ... I mean, I'm terribly flattered, of course, but, um, the thing is, I don't want you to be under any false ... Hello, Jack! Hello, Alison. You look different. Er, I knew you looked different. What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real. Your ears?  Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false. That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.  Well, I ... Sorry ... Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late? Well ... well, I ...  My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren. Er, don't you want to search me?  My I.D. cards.  But I could be anybody.  I'm Lowry, Mr Warren ... Sam Lowry. Hello. Sam Lowry. Ah. (he pauses - looking around) Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console? I'll bring it back in ten minutes. Yes.  Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.  I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something  What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes. You haven't switched it on.  Gillian Layton, age twenty three, eyes, blue, hair, black, weight, one hundred and twenty-one pounds, distinguishing marks, blemish on right shoulder, scar on left elbow  Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001. (switching off the machine and getting up) That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much. What's that? I'm looking for Officer 412/L. Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?  Er, excuse me!  Excuse me.  Jack!!  Are you officer 412/L? Thanks. Are you officer 412/L? Yes, thanks.  Ah ... I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.  I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want. What is it? Am I? How do you mean? Not much.  Not really, no. B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it? No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on. You got the wrong man. You killed him? I'm sure you have So how ...? What has Tuttle done?  He's a freelance subversive?  What's she done? Er ... no. Er ... but I would've found out anyway.  Tell me about Layton. A terrorist? Ah ... thanks.  But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ... Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?  Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family. Why? Hell, not for any reason ... Out of kindness.  So what are you going to do about her?  You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department? Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her. Trust me. You do trust me, don't you? And you're mine. Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us. They weren't at school with us. Take her off the list. Say it was a mistake. Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while. Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.  Trust me. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Shit ... it's here somewhere. My name's Lowry, Sam Lowry - Expediting ... can't this wait?  Sorry, it'll have to wait. STOP! Let her go! Well done ... uh ... excellent work ... quick thinking. I'll take charge of her now ...  Come with me, please. Don't look back! Act naturally!  Ow! That hurt! Oh, God ... no!  Well done, that's it ... Let's go! Vrmmm. Vrmmm.  What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!  Sam Lowry. Hello. This sounds insane, I know, but I've been dreaming about you. Even before I saw you you were in my dreams. Weird isn't it. I mean ... I don't know what it means ... but it might mean something ... mightn't it? I hope so. Anyway you're in danger and I think we should get out of here, now, quick! Come on!  Bloody hell! Do as I say!  Please!  Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer - (he checks the number somewhere. On the badge?) DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.  Oh, sorry. ... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ... Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you. I don't know. (realizing that this includes him) Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.  You know, smoking's bad for you.  Yes, of course. Sorry. Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away? Why? Why not? What? Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.  Where are you taking me? What's going on here? OK. What's in the parcel? It's heavy. I'd rather trust you. Looking for you. Really.  Suit me? What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists? Things would be worse without Information Retrieval. Well, no system is. Well, all wars do - Well, terrorists of course. Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day. What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.  Every day? Turn around! They'll be there waiting. Security. No. Please. They're going to arrest you. Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! (he grabs for the emergency brake)  Will you please turn back.  Turn! I was right! Step on it! Now you're the one that's out of your mind. Oh God! What have we done? It wasn't supposed to happen like this. ""And your children all gone."" ""Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone"" ... Do you think anyone's hurt? This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie. Please, Jill ... I love you. There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat? You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet. I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special. ........... It's a bomb isn't it? I'm going to open it! Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.  I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?  Er, yes ...  Are you alright? JILL Yes.  You don't deserve to be! You should be dead, or maimed like them .... How could you ...?  What a bloody stupid thing ... I should. have made you open it in the lorry DON'T TOUCH HER!!  Where is she? Is she here? Jill! Jill! Are you there?! Is here a girl here? Tall, fair hair, blue eyes?  I've got to find her! Jill! Jill! Jill! Jill! Mr Warren ... I have to find out about ...  Lime, I need to use your computer Shit! Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.  She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.  You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league? It could all be coincidental. Jack, she's innocent!  Yes we have, Jack!  Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright? What happened to you after ... No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...  Are you sure?  C'mon, we've got to get you off the streets. For God's sake, what's happened? What have you done to my flat? What is it? C'mon. We've got to get out of here. My mother said it would be all right. Well, she's my mother, not yours. How long will she he away?  Thank you, Matthews. Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long. I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office? And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information? Thank you, Dawson. Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?  Jill?  You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead. Everything is going to be all right.  She's dead. Check the list!  JILL!!! Where's Jill? What have you done with Jill?  Where's Jill? What's happened to Jill? I'm not guilty! Not guilty you stupid bastar...  Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?! Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.  Help me! This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?! I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here! Please, I've got to find Jill.  Dead?  No, no ... I did that... Jack? Jack?... Jack? Jack, I'm innocent! Help me. This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off. What? Help me, Jack! I'm frightened! Jack ... JACK!! ... You can't ... No, don't! Where is she?  what? ... Oh ...  Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...  I don't dream anymore."
limitless,EDDIE ,Bradley Cooper," They found me. I might have five minutes. I'll never know how they got past security in a half-billion dollar building. They've become sophisticated. Before they couldn't have done this. But now...? I will never let them touch me. My neighbor must've heard the noise. Opened his door to complain. He bought me half a minute. I wish he hadn't. Last thoughts are self- pitying and mine are no exception: the waste. The waste of it all. I mean, how many of us ever know what it is to become... the perfect version of ourselves. I'd come that close. To having an impact on the world. And now, the only thing I'd have an impact on... ... was the sidewalk. Not so long ago, this was me. I was a writer. Two years after my copywriting job at Dexter & Kerr came to a non-mutual end, I had, in an extraordinary burst of desperate energy, bullshitted my way into my first book contract. This was it: Now, at last, I was ready to write. Gearing up, that's all. Getting psyched. A few days did pass this way... maybe a few months... Friends fled. And banks became attentive. But just in case you think nothing ever happened to me.... Just like that. I was kind of under the impression you cared a little more than just-- Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to Mark on Friday. If you could just wait, see what he says- And it's all shit to you now? Then you know I could use a friend. Well -- what'll work, then? Not with that enthusiastic invite-- She knew what was beckoning: the lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in Newark. We'd even had sex on it once. And it was a thing to be pitied and avoided. Lindy. I really thought I had it in me to do something. --I wasn't getting around it, but it was fucking there. And now, I, ah... don't think it is. There. --Anything. At all. If, what? I never think about Melissa--! --Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't tell me what happened yesterday. You got it--?!  You deserve it, Lindy. She was right. I was almost 35. No one talks about ""potential"" at 35. I had missed the on-ramp. Soon I'd be sleeping in the lower bunk of my childhood bedroom... my father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory... Of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs, is there any more useless than... the ex-brother-in- law? But who's counting. Sedentary job, you know... As a matter of fact, I've got a book contract. How about you?  Still dealing, Vernon? No. Nah, I should go--  Enticing invitation. Thanks. It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern.  Fuck. So... how's Melissa? I'm making conversation, Vern. How don't you know? You're her brother. A couple of kids... Who's the husband? It's just a question, Vern. Is that what she said--?! ""A coke thing.""  How's it going... Well... I'm behind. I'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know. Not one fucking word, Vern. Oh, no-- no, no, no- You're still dealing. You mean a lab in some little Yalie's basement? Give me a-- Okay, what is it? What's in it? I'm too old for this, Vernon. Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good? I smoke too much: my chest is sore. A fucking corpse has more energy than I do, I've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions. One of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and I'll keel over dead. My life's in the crapper, and I DON'T think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if I do some brand new, shiny designer DRUG! I don't want it, Vern. All the way home she was back on my mind ... Melissa. She'd been so smart. Smarter than anyone around her. And oh, how she loved to provoke people... I thought, by now, she'd be curing cancer, directing movies, running for the Senate... What had happened? Her life made no sense. I mean, I could see a direct, plausible link between this Eddie, broke and buzzed at three o'clock in the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie... ...vomiting on his boss' desk during a presentation... ... or stealing his dying Aunt's Percocet. But there was no link between my Melissa and this upstate Melissa dumped, cold-calling people from her living room. 40 long blocks later I was ""home."" Well. There was less than nothing to lose. I didn't want to see anybody. Especially not my landlord's nasty young wife. Tuesday. Just tell him- I suddenly had extra reason to get away from her. I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance. I had gotten remarkably little information from Vernon about what this drug would do. ...What if it was a hallucinogen... oh my God... listening to her rag, if I were tripping...? I'd jump out a fucking window. And then... I felt it. Levels more, layers more, 3-D more... galactically more. But the same. Just the depth and beauty... of clarity. What's wrong? ""I was blind but now I see."" You don't like me, and I don't blame you -- you see a schlumpy energy- sucking defeated sack of shit sponging off your husband. You're hoping I'll blow my brains out. But my existence shouldn't make you this upset. What is it? Something wrong at school? People who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about Dorothea Lange. I just saw the book-- I've seen it before. It was true. 12 years ago. In college... ...sitting on the couch of a T.A. I was trying to make, waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom... hoping she'd have a condom... Somehow, my unconscious had served that up... a memory I'd never even recorded. Or was it there the whole time... and all I needed... was the access? Vern was right. This was no recreational drug. If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use. Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor. Information from the odd museum show, a half-read article, some PBS documentary, was all bubbling up to my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information. She didn't have a chance. We'd really worked on her paper, too. In 45 minutes it was a polished gem. She was pleased. One nice little side effect...? I stayed hard for hours. Happy and sore, I returned home. ... But it couldn't be my home, could it? Who would live like this? What was this drug? I couldn't stay messy on it, I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours... ...hadn't eaten... So. Abstemious and tidy. What was this -- a drug for people who want to get anal? I wasn't high, wasn't wired --just clear. What I needed to do. And how to do it. The next morning, I sent a little probe down into my brain. No surge of brilliance came up to greet me. I felt thick and stupid -- a shuffling zombie without my coffee and cigarette. In short... I was back. But something remained. No. Yes. Three pages. That's all you have to read. If you read them in the next hour, and you don't want to keep reading I'll give back the advance. But how would I finish? It was ""enhanced"" Eddie who displayed all that brilliance. Not me. Vern! It's Eddie. Vern -- last night 90 pages just wrote themselves! I totally chucked the novel I pitched them --I suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole societal economic class struggle -- and its solution -- didn't have to be futuristic or fictional -- it was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in our lifetime -- and I could just lay it out, like, like a manifesto, or something, like Mein Kampf except not by a crazy racist fuck!  Okay, I won't talk any more about this if you let me in. WHAT HAP- Yeah. That stuff's amazing. VERN- What's... um... what's it called? ""The boys in the kitchen...?"" Vern, that doesn't sound FDA approved. Okay, so what did we have here? Some unknown, untested, possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere, given to me by a highly unreliable guy I hadn't seen in years. Yes. Definitely. Uh... sure. It was amazing how quickly it all slotted back into place... ..the dealer-client dynamic...... ...the easy sacrificing of dignity for the guaranteed return of a dime bag, or a gram, or in this case a little pill that was going to cost me a month's rent. Yes... I... I need to report a murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J. I won't. It took them forever. And the longer I sat there, the clearer I saw... Vern had known whoever had done this. He'd opened the door. And one guess what they'd been looking for. At least you got your last meal. You never did like to cook... Heyheyhey! I'm the one that called you! ... No, ex-wife's brother. I just ran into him on the street and he invited me up to, you know... Wha-- No! Talk! What're you -- He was -- I don't know, I heard he was sort of an antiques dealer. Yeah... of, uh... Viennese kind of... chairs... sort of curlicue leg kind of things-- Melissa? I hadn't heard her voice in 10 years. Right before. I'd just run into him on the street. Melissa --you don't think I had anything to do with- Not on this line, no. Melissa... maybe... Then... I'll see you at the funeral. Okay. But I knew, when his attention wandered to something more pressing, that he was going to let me go. Only then did it occur to me that someone could have followed me from Vern's apartment. Probably not. Hopefully not. Worth the risk? Back on MDT, it was obvious what I should do. Vern's cash... ...combined with an unprecedented surge of motivation... ...enabled me to finish the book in four days. A tablet a day... kept the torpor away. And what I could do with my day... was limitless. I now had cultural appetites. Learned to read music in a week... The only cloud was the nagging feeling I was being followed. Was I? Or did MDT create paranoia? The focal point of my existence quickly became... protecting my stash. Call it a homage. I had a new, improved game.  So you're saying that any author who's commandeered adjective status, ""Orwellian, Dickensian--""? Which means a prosaic author's work rests on a foundation of acclaim- So you're saying praise and fame are unrelated to achievement, that the greatest hits CD cannot possibly contain good songs? That Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity? Well, then I'd guess you'd rather not hear about what I, personally, think could launch a thousand ships? Fish in a barrel. And it wasn't just women. I was, for the first time in my life, a presence... Of course, all this seemed to work better with people I didn't know... than with people who knew me... ...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally mis-invested -- these guys are have done ONLY the most Pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the stock --  Okay, remember when I explained default flops? Did any of that stick?  CDS's? CDO's CBO's? I quickly returned to the unfamiliar audience. --Sure you get a short term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years? Against aggressive over-expansion? There aren't, because there are no safeguards in human nature. We're wired to overreach -- you look at history, I mean, all the countries that ruled the world? Portugal? With its big, butch navy? All that's left is salt cod and cheap condos -- the Brits? Now they just sit on their dank little island, fussing over their suits. Nobody stops and thinks, hey, we're doing pretty well, we've got Poland and France, and a big Swiss bank account -- let's not invade Russia in the winter! Let's go home and pop a beer and live off the interest! Hey, I want in on it! My brain was just pouring this stuff out. Everything I'd ever read, heard, seen, was now organized and available --here it is, here you go.. Thank you so much. ""I must have a portfolio."" Very well -- if I must, I must. But Vern's cash was low. And it takes cash to make cash... But it takes cash to make cash... I'd like to re-negotiate my advance.  This isn't going to work. Yes, but I now see that writing, as a profession, is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else. No, I mean it, look at the life. Incarceration, loneliness, burrowing down into your own psyche, increasingly insulated from any truth, because you're not in the currents of the world any more, you're rattling around inside the cage of your brain, self- cannibalizing... Oh, if you're good, there's some remuneration, eventually, after paperbacks, but at best your career'll be oozing along like a snail, a few thousand more copies, whoop-dee-doo, you're ""developing a readership,"" -- for what? So you can end up in Phoenix on a Saturday night reading from your own work at some holdout indie book store to a bored audience of ten? --Half of them there for the wine and cheese?  I don't think any goal will be really achievable, Mark, until I'm sitting on a large pile of cash. I would have to start very, very small... in a down market. No one was making money. But no one had MDT... Armed with Vern's last 800 dollars, I made 4000 in a day.  It was too slow. Next day: $7,500.00  Still too slow. I needed more capital... Why not? Because I quintupled my money four days in a row. It's not luck. You think? And that's a problem for you because--? I won't. And what if I do? You think I keep detailed records of my investors? You'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened. My new friend, Kevin Doyle, showed me how you could leverage two and a half times your cash at a day- trading firm... I'd been upping the dose for over a week. It seemed to cut my learning curve. It was instinct. But informed instinct -- instinct based on huge amounts of research, which, thanks to MDT, was conducted more rapidly and comprehensively than anyone at Lafayette Day Trading would ever know... But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into. That's still on. Should be announced in a week. At the end of the week my brokerage account contained... over a million dollars. I'd heard the old metaphors about the stock market: it was a collective nervous system, a global brain, a numerical representation of the will of God... Whatever it was, I was jacked in, booted up - my mind was living tissue inside the greater, functioning whole.  By the end of the second week I had 2.6 in the bank.... The word quickly got out. Four job offers... my bank, raising my line of credit... a reporter...  All my new friends. And finally, Kevin Doyle, trying to sound casual. Apparently he does. Self-improvement month. Someone gave me a wake-up call. Why? It stuck, didn't it? Who says I didn't? So what -- it's not getting over? Is that it? Begging for what. Gosh. This is so unexpected. Of course, we started up again. Her place... My place... Every place. Nothing. No. With success comes enemies. No proverb. An inevitability. Then... I found myself at the door. With no consciousness that I had moved. It had been three days. I'm eating, Kevin. Have a toast point. Medication. I'm on special medication. --Yes, that's partially what I'm SAYING--  Of course, not everyone can understand the patterns. Look, there's no time for human judgement anymore. You see a chance, you blink, and it's gone. We entered the age of decentralized, online decision- making, with the decisions being made by hundreds of millions of individual investors around the world, people who don't even know each other -- making a killing in less time than it takes to sneeze. Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works. Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce. I don't have delusions of grandeur. I have an actual recipe for grandeur. But these companies aren't the question, are they? Well -- you're upmarket energy -- what do you want with these little solar/windmill/hippie outfits? --Unless you wanted to play both sides of the fence, control the whole energy enchilada. But these wouldn't get you there in emerging markets. You'd need... Whoa, whoa. This must be some big- ass merger you're contemplating. And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon Associates... Carl, it's just rationalization. Is Hank Atwood going to go for it? Come on -- the two of you together? The world would have to come to you begging for energy like Oliver Twist with his little bowl of gruel. It doesn't matter. It won't come off. You'd have to back off Libya. I don't think you'd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home. Ooh. Now you're curious.  It's getting late. I'm at your disposal. The Spartans weren't big on amenities. I didn't go in. I wanted to walk, move, digest, ingest... There are moments in life, moments when you know you've crossed a bridge, your old life is over. Van Loon was my bridge. One week, two weeks from now, I would be hobnobbing with ambassadors, flying to Dubai for meetings, blowing off supermodels, vacationing in Medici villas... And that too, was only a bridge... Suddenly... There was another skip. How had I gone that last 20 blocks? I got another ten... ... then... I was back uptown. What bar was this? Was it Harlem...? Same bar? Different bar? How long had passed...? And it happened again-- And again... And again... And again... When it finally stopped, I couldn't account for the last eight hours of my life. There was nothing to do but walk home. It was my first sleep in two days. Should I? Would I start ""skipping time"" again? Even off MDT, I decided to give Van Loon's files a shot. They were fucking hieroglyphs. I can't make the meeting, I'm, uh... I'm sick. I need to, ah, analyze this data- Already I recognized it... the thick tongue, the leaden synapses. It was regular Eddie - the Eddie that, now, was unbearable to be. Well, I can't pass a fucking test right now! Okay, Kevin. Okay. It was my first morning off MDT in a month. The beginnings of a headache was curling around my head like a big fat, greasy python. But the time-skips had me scared. My thought -- such as I had one -- was to tap dance with Van Loon until I could find out more about MDT. Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot of Colorado... What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone knows about Atwood. Nowhere. Yeah, his Great Leap Forward. Excuse me. I couldn't have. ...or could I? If I could walk, talk, conduct business, seduce a woman, fight-- with no memory... could I kill someone? Was it even me? Who was I?! Melissa--? Melissa, I want to talk to you. Please. Meet me somewhere... Nonono -- at Charlie's, across the street. At two. Please. Melissa -- it's important, please come -- you have to tell me what you're talking about! I realized that there were other people who might know about MDT... Vernon's other clients. Hello, may I speak to Paul Kaplan, please? I'm a journalist. From Electronics Today magazine. I'm... I'm so sorry. Goodbye. I, ah, may I speak to Jerry Brady? Uh-- Bill Johnson. Oh my God. What's wrong with him? Of all the people I called, three were dead, and the rest were sick. In the end, my stupidity saved me. What was I dealing with? Who could tell me? I hoped against hope... that Melissa would show. Melissa...? You... how are you doing? I guess I lost some weight... Since when do you read the Post? Melissa, what do you mean? No. Why? And...? A lot. Yeah. Finish your story. How many times had I thought of her, my first real love... But that Melissa had unraveled in time and space -- she was a ghost now. I was never going to see her again, never bump into her in the street... But when I run out-- Who invented MDT? No one seemed to be watching my apartment, maybe I could chance it. I was getting sicker by the moment. Luckily I had one pill on me... I... I... ahh... I'm here now! I'll get you a check. Gennady, look- I wasn't thinking. Look, we just need to go to my bank- OOF! NOTHING-- It's aspirin. That's the whole thing, plus twenty. Aspirin and vitamins. I had to get my stash. I'm sorry -- I'm sick. I wasn't going to make it home- IT WON'T HELP--! I need to get-- it's very simple: I need my pills. They're... for my headaches... It's... complicated. Not... the way you... No. That won't-- Hello? W-what? I knew what was going on. It was supposed to be legal. I have a supply... stashed... I just need... to get it... Not to my apartment. I moved it. I was smart. I was on MDT. Hi -- Have you got it? Are you sure? Don't get out. Call the cops. LINDY--!!! Yes. What's happening? Just be still, stop talking. What? Listen to me. Can he see you? Can he see you?! There is something. Listen to me. Reach into the bag and take one of the pills. Yes. You will know what do to, Lindy. Take one, and you'll know. You'll come on in thirty seconds. And yes, you will think your way out, that's what it does. Are you taking it--? Lindy. I love you.  --Lindy? Are you there? We'll stay here for a couple of days. We'll be powered up, we'll be able to think our way out of this... I'm back. All right? I can take care of you now. A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you. Looking for me? I was under the impression that our business was settled. So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman. What shit. Well, so do I. You took the last one. I can't get more -- the dealer's dead. Nothing. I. Can. Do. A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on-- I might... be able to get ten.  Ten. And no guarantee there's more. Self-pity and MDT were not compatible. One has to go on... ...Patch up what's left... I was sick. I shouldn't have gone to the meeting. I tried to cancel, but Kevin imploded on me-- A hundred and five, is what you were talking to, Carl. Delirium. I sent over my revised projections-- I know, but I think if you look at THEM- I'm sorry. Two months after I started MDT, I was helping broker the most important merger in corporate history. I found that if I maintained an even dose... remembered to eat... drank no alcohol... the blackouts didn't recur. I was quickly back up to speed... Is it possible to construct an... imperceptible compartment? Quite large. I would never again stash my MDT, not in an apartment, not in Fort Knox. I don't want it known that I have any security. You won't precede me, you'll follow me, never less than ten steps behind... `inconspicuous' doesn't begin to describe you. You're not there. You're a CEO'S wife -- you're wallpaper. Safer though my stash now was, I was not sitting around until it ran out. Can you make more? Meaning...? That's too long. Two million dollars if you do it in six. It was all going to work out... I thought we straightened this out, Detective. What is it about? Luckily, I could now afford Morris Brandt, the best lawyer in New York. Time was bought, and I was released -- for now. I don't remember. Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood remained unaware that soon, I would be in a witness lineup as a possible murderer. ...well, a unified front between Van Loon and Atwood would be lethally effective, and not a moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Mexico that both our companies are secretly sniffing out... Well, the governmental bribe structure is, in itself, corrupt, so of course information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought. And there are other barbarians waving cash at the gates. I have a list here, in descending order of threat... It flew. Of course, he's not going to tell you right now... Might be an act. When this is over?  I don't know. You haven't given me the answer. All right. If all this comes off... what's my take? I trust you. Well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty. Let's say forty- five. What is the asking price? It was, as it turned out, a good moment to move. No one knew, or would ever know, that I now carried the pills with me at all times. Right away, it was obvious he was on MDT. Next week? You can fuck yourself.  Not that you'll feel anything. Obviously, this could not go on. But there is very little on this earth that 45 million dollars can't solve. And tomorrow at nine, Atwood would sign the papers. Okay, the decision could have changed -- that makes sense -- but the discourtesy doesn't.  It's still on.  I saw his eyes: it's on. I realize that this is a useless platitude, but... if there's anything we can do... Cagey fuck like him giving away power of attorney? But Atwood wouldn't get better. Because Atwood was out of MDT. Well. Why be surprised? How many other meteoric rises might be explained by MDT? At least I had some; my life wasn't in jeopardy. Only my money... ...and my liberty. Why? Of course. Who was out there? The woman's husband? Was some bellboy I undertipped about to end my life? They'd kept me all day. I'd missed my meeting with Gennady. But I had more important business... Not a word, Carl. Personal time, Carl. Phone off. You're not telling me there's been any movement. A coma? It had gotten out, somehow. But I felt thick, stupid, tired. A small pain was starting behind my eyes. I'd been unable to take my MDT, and I was overdue. Was it Brandt? Or someone else? The police station? A coat room? How? How? In an hour I'd be useless. In two I'd be sick. In 24, dead. I couldn't think. Only MDT could help me. I had no MDT. And then... One thought.  Was there anywhere... ... anywhere at all...I could have left one pill...? I had to keep thinking. Somewhere safe... It wasn't downstairs security, alerting me to a visitor. And so... here I am. I knew they would kill me, slowly and horribly. But this choice would at least be mine. But we're instinctive creatures. We want to live. It was possible. And possible was enough. I'm plum out. Not much of a triumph, was it? Because I would die here, too. Only MDT could help me, and the last of it was in this fuck's bloodstream... Later, it would be noted that my neighbor was in the music business. One of his drug deals had obviously gone bad...  And the night was still young. I'm sure you're curious about what's happened to your boss. I certainly am. If my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, to save his life, then why is he dead? At what point was the Pony Express supposed to ride in with the life- saving medication?  Or, did the Pony decide that he should be running his own Pony show? Minus the dog. I would not go back. I would not be stopped. I have a lunch. Who's that? Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they -- research? Nice to see you. We appreciate everything you've done for us-- Maintain? What are you saying? Have you been watching me from the beginning? Who's ""us?"" How did it get on the street? And what about for you? Why don't you take it? And in return...? I do what. And later...? What will you be ""bothering"" me with? And if I don't like your ideas? Luckily I can do that myself. My lab? Which one? You sure? Tell me something. Did I kill that woman? After you. Please. Don't underestimate your own creation. I mean, you invented it. What does it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks. You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours. Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it. What if I just ask the drug... how to tell the drug... how to fuck itself? I mean, isn't it like the 8-ball? It always answers."
fargo,MARGE ,Frances McDormand," ...  Oh, my.  Where?...  Yah... Oh, geez... ...  Okay.  There in a jif... Real good, then. ...  You can sleep, hon.  It's early yet. Yah. That's okay, hon.  I gotta run. Aw, you can sleep, hon. Aw, Norm. Thanks, hon.  Time to shove off. Love ya, hon. Hon? Prowler needs a jump. Hiya, Lou. Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's the deal, now?  Gary says triple homicide? Where is everybody? Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez. Here's the second one...  It's in the head and the ... hand there, I guess that's a defensive wound.  Okay. ...  Where's the state trooper? Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal. I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd. Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from his footprints he looks like a big fella - Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf. I'm fine - it's just morning sickness. ...  Well, that passed. Yah.  Now I'm hungry again. Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs. Let's go take a look at that trooper. There's two of 'em, Lou! Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy. For Pete's sake. Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy.  It's a real shame. You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya? Somebody shut his lights.  I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back. Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open yet? No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers. You look in his citation book? Uh-huh. I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou. Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates.  DLR? Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685? Yah. Hiya, hon. Yah. You bet.  Thanks for lunch.  What do we got here, Arbie's? ...  How's the paintin' goin'? Aw, hon, you're better'n them. They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them. Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me. How we doin' on that vehicle? Geez, that's a good lead.  The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35? Oh, yah? Where you girls from? Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like. In what way? Can you be any more specific? Was he funny-looking apart from that? So you were having sex with the little fella, then? Is there anything else you can tell me about him? And what about the other fella? Yah? Uh-huh. Yah, that can happen. Oh, yah? Oh, you bet, yah. ...  Well, I'm turnin' in, Norm. Hello? Yah? ...  Well, yah.  Who's this? ...  Mike Yanagita! Yah, yah, course I remember. How are ya?  What time is it? No, that's okay. Yah. Yah, that's me. Okay, ya know.  Okay. Yah - how are you doon? Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike.  It's great to hear from ya. Pretty darn good, ya want some? Whatcha got there? Mm. Uh-huh...  A what? Uh-huh. ...  Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then. How ya doin'? Real good.  I'm Mrs. Gunderson, I have a reservation. Is there a phone down here, ya think? ...  Detective Sibert?  Yah, this is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd, we spoke -  Yah.  Well, actually I'm in town here.  I had to do a few things in the Twin Cities, so I thought I'd check in with ya about that USIF search on Shep Proudfoot... Oh, yah?...  Well, maybe I'll go visit with him if I have the...  No, I can find that...  Well, thanks a bunch.  Say, d'ya happen to know a good place for lunch in the downtown area?...  Yah, the Radisson...  Oh, yah?  Is it reasonable? - Wednesday night? Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace? Anyone else residing there? Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning. It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling. ...  Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole - Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater. Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide... ...  I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that. So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya? Mr. Lundegaard? I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here - Huh?  Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here. ...  You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard? Well, you can help me.  My name's Marge Gunderson - Uh-huh.  Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera? ...  Mr. Lundegaard? Yah.  Yah.  Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there.  So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then? Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.  I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then. Mike! Yah - easy there - you do too! I'm expecting, ya know. Just a Diet Coke. ...  This is a nice place. You're livin' in Edina, then? Oh, yah, a long time ago. Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss.  What about you, Mike?  Are you married - you have kids? No, I -  Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that. No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck. No, no, that's fine. I think I remember Linda, yah. She was - yah.  So things didn't work out, huh? Well, they're a good outfit. It sounds like you're doin' really super. I'm sorry. No, I didn't... I'm sorry, Mike. Better times. Well, I always liked you, Mike. It's okay, Mike -  Should we get together another time, ya think? It's okay... It's okay, Mike... Norm? They bitin'? Oh, pretty good.  They bitin'? Oh, fine. No, no. Had dinner at a place called the King's Table.  Buffet style.  It was pretty darn good. Yah, not too bad.  So it's nice up there? No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd. Mm.  But ya think he's all right? I saw him last night and he's - Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' - Linda. Linda Cooksey? So ... they didn't... Oh.  Oh, my. Oh.  Geez. Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a suprise. Hello? Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother you again.  Can I come in? I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real short, then.  I'm on my way out of town, but I was just -  Do you mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying a bit of a load here. Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday.  I was just wondering - Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates.  And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected. So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently? but do you know that for sure without - Yah, but - I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir?  Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of - ...  I'm sorry, sir? Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me.  I'm just doin' my job here. Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson? ...  Mr. Lundegaard? Sir?  Right now? I'm sorry, sir, I - ...  Oh, for Pete's sake. ...  Oh, for Pete's sake... ...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the interview.  He's feelin' the interview... ...  Detective Sibert, please... Uh-huh. And his wife? Geez.  Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought.  You call his home? Oh, my. Boy, this thing is really ... geez. Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding. End a April. This'll be our first.  We've been waiting a long time. Oh, yah, I know that! You have children? Oh, now he's adorable. Oh, he's adorable. Where'd you get him that parka? Oh, no, I can't let you do that. Well, okay - thank you, Detective. The day of our homicides. And this guy is... Gustafson's accountant. But we still haven't found Gustafson. Sorry - didn't copy. Copy.  And Lundegaard too. Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake. Yah, the loudmouth.  So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson? Copy. There's the car!  There's the car! My car!  My car!  Tan Ciera! Copy.  Yah, send me back-up! Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters. Stop!  Police!  Turn around and hands up! ...  Hands up! ...  Police! ...  Halt! ...  Halt! ...  Halt! ...  All right, buddy.  On your belly and your hands clasped behind you. ...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard in there? ...  I guess that was your accomplice in the wood chipper. ...  And those three people in Brainerd. ...  And for what?  For a little bit of money. ...  There's more to life than money, you know. ...  Don't you know that?...  And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day... ...  Well... ...  I just don't unnerstand it. Oooph! They announced it? ...  So? Your mallard? Norm, that's terrific! It's terrific! Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps! When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones! That's terrific. ...  I'm so proud a you, Norm. I love you, Norm. Two more months."
slither,BILL ,Nathan Fillion," Your uncle Barry left her for a stripper up in Winnsboro. Right. Come on now, honey, door's this way. She's just scared, Margaret. She ain't a bull, Trevor! Get back. It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's gonna hurt you. That's right. Just gonna pull this cord out. It's gonna be all right. Hell, she took a phone. Now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night. That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger. Hell, you don't know that, Margaret. You're right, Jack.    Margaret, you're fired. Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked. Sorry. Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass. What you up to? Pretty, ain't they? Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot. There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope. Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me. Oh, will you now? Hey, Grant. Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you... Oh yeah.     Fuck you, fat ass. Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez? Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ? She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved. The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant. The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me, we also saw him that night, with mud all over his slacks. Have him call me right away, okay? Starla?!!   Starla, are you in there?! Starla?! Starla. I talked to the CDC. They didn't have nothin' on file consistent with Grant's... symptoms. New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her. You all right? Shit. 'Mornin', Jack. Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business. Don't worry, we'll find him.  Anything new? Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe. Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria? What? And that makes you look like a squid? Rorschach. I see we're fucked.   Three ranches in three days. He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it. Wally, come on. Trevor and Margaret, get some folks together. I think I know where he's gonna hit next. So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went missing from here, the Raglans' ranch. Two nights ago, a mare was stolen from this property, run by Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with the cleft palate. Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally. And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit-storm took place. And if he sticks to that pattern he'll be here next. Belongs to a family, the Strutemyers'. Now I know y'all are tired and you've barely seen your families. But we're gonna have to go there tonight, lie low and wait. Just remember, we don't know what we're up against here. So let's be careful. Can't hurt. Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go. He tried to kill you, Starla. Starla, it ain't -- Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night? Starla here's twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there?' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along. I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, I think it's you. I'm gonna have to decline.' Yeah, maybe I did. Starla, where you...? Fire!   Fire! Starla, get the hell out of here! Oh... Brenda, um... Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's -- what's happening here, exactly? I think we best get you to a hospital right quick. He led us here. Margaret, cover your mouth! Don't let 'em in your mouths! 11-41. We're gonna need paramedics out here right away. We got four men down. Shelby, you there? Shelby, this is Bill.     We got an emergency here. Goddammit. Shelby? No reception out here. No. I'll go. The three of you, you wait here. Get these folks, out of the barn. The stench and rot can't be any good for 'em. Hey! What's -- ? What's going on here? What happened to you, Dwight? Okay. Y'all just wait in this spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics for you. Kylie can come with -- Come on. Shit.   Ammo's in the trunk. Trevor!   Margaret!  Where are you?! My friends are still in the forest. We need their weight. Dumbshits. Come on! Shelby? Shelby, you there? Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast. Shelby -- Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right? Are you nodding? I can't hear when you're nodding. We'll be there in ten minutes. Kylie, honey.    Please. A lot of bad things have happened to you today, we know. But we need your help to find out what's going on. The worm? Who?  Who? A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.  So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant? Shit. Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up. Do it. Hey, Starla. Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love. Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too. When you wanted to run away, I called your dad. I'm sorry. Hell, Starla.    I always regretted that. Fuck me. Shelby! Shelby! Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away! Come on. Just block the doors, any way you can. What are you doing?! What? No, Starla!   No! Nooo! Hey. Starla, over here. Yeah.   Good. There you go. I'll get it for you.      Ibuprofen or aspirin? We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh? Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody -- It's my nature."

mimic,SUSAN ,Mira Sorvino," We'll see... With the aid of genetic labs throughout the country, we recombined cockroach DNA with genetic information from termites and mantids. We were able to create a biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if you will... Blattida Traditor. The ""Judas Roach"". The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers, with a short life-span and heightened pheromone emission. The female is basically a sexual magnet; common males travelled miles and fought for the right to mate with them. When they did, they took away something else we added -- a hormone, passed through sexual congress that causes their metabolism to go into overdrive.  No matter what their food intake, they starved to death in a matter of hours. Please. Do you think we did the right thing? You know what I mean... We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of... We just don't know.  We're down to a ""couple"" now, huh? Don't worry, I'll save your honor. Maybe I'll even marry you. ...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let me tell you why. Insects have no hands. All they have is this set of mandibles. See?  This little piggy will grab the prey. Then this little piggy will tear it in half... ...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth.  These are precision tools here. Can you remember that? Good.  Then get it right. Don't tease.  Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they? Trust me. I've never been this late. Never. If nun's pee is what it takes... You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that. I'll be late. Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions... ...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.  Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here. What? Oh, Jesus. Come on, darlin'... What's this? Hello.  I suppose so. Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been upstate?  I guess they got lost in this city. You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars? Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you catch will be in better shape. Alphabet City kids- there's much worse things they could be selling. Siri?  Siri?!  Can you...?  Could you...help me...? I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay? I have no idea.  Are you ready?  It bit you. This wing configuration. I've never... And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult. My God. It's breathing. I know.  Help me get a sample. Hold on, big guy, hold on... Hold on a second... Call security.  I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel. This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts! Don't you get it? It's more than that. You know why insects don't grow larger? Because they don't have a complex respiratory system. What I saw did. It had lungs. Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen. I did a PH test on its tarsal pads. There's only two species who match the enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant in the Amazon... The other we released here two years ago. Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop... Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it? Pull over! Metaxonycha Godmani. We're here to deal. You sure you didn't see one of these? An ""Ootheca"". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh ""weirdbugs"" inside. You okay? There's something under here. Let me try.  My hands are smaller. No, there's...  That's wonderful!  What grade are you in? I guess that could be arranged. I heard how you talked to him. He was just doing his job. No such thing, baby. I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.  Right. Oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. Least that's what I thought. I was just late. Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are... Siri... Siri! ...you don't even know what you're looking for. Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you... It didn't bite me. You tell me. What about Siri? You think it's some form of Strickler's, don't you? Oh, my God. What's your name? Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you? Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!  Where'd you find it? Posterior sternites are gone...half the protonum rotted off. Near hatching.  Thing must've died about three weeks ago. Do you have a polaroid? It's me. Can you hear me? I have. I'm on my way. I've got something for you to look at... Okay.... Peter? HELP!!!  Don't. No, Jesus, no.  Peter...  It doesn't have a heart. Just inner chambers... No... That's what it wanted you to see.  That's camouflage... This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic their predators. A butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar can copy a snake... This has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator it's ever had... Us. Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code... This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud? All these...they're like tunnels of an insect colony. Once these things hit a certain population density, they'll have to move out, form new colonies. We have to get help down here.  Burn the tunnels before...  The lights! I got it! Hurry! Please! Oh, God.  The blood... His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor! They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired! Exac...  Give me your razor. Rub it on the windows! Just do it!! Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other. But the power... Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV! Peter-  The scent won't last... Manny... We'll find him. We'll be back and find him. You're going to have to keep it really slow.  Their eyes react to sudden movements. Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...  That's it. That's it. Breathe easy. Open it. Choke on it, motherfuckers.  The scent's fading... Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!  THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR! Peter!! Run!! Peter!!  GO!! What? MOVE BACK!!! You all right? Which way? We're no leaving you! There. I can't tell if it's working! Oh, come on, come on! Your arm, you can't... We're gonna make it! Ah... Peter... Don't look back! No...  They've come up..."
freaked,RICK ,Vincent Hammond," Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie Lee? One day I'm a hot young movie star, and the next day I'm a hideous mutant freak, covered with festering lesions. Well, it's kinda long, but okay. It all started when I signed a deal to be spokesman for the E.E.S. conglomerate...  So, what kind of crap do you scumbags want me to peddle? Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a star, got it, Hertz?  Rico, give these misguided clowns Tony Danza's phone number, and let's get the hell out of here.  Noxon? Wasn't that just banned? But I heard that shit's lethal. Santa ""Flan?"" What kind of shitty name for a country is that? Wait a second-- Look, it sounds great, but-- Uh-huh.  Where the fuck is Ernie? IT'S THE ERNIE! WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! Yeah, why? NO!  Let's get the hell out of here! If all the world is a stage, then let us shine the spotlight on truth, integrity, and a deep compassion for all life. Leave me alone, troll!  That was before I got an entertainment lawyer. Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good. ALRIGHT! In the bag. AHHHHHHH! You gonna eat your peanuts, Ernie? Here we are Ernie, Santa Spam. World famous for loud music and hot sex! Give me a few hours. Sure glad that wasn't our plane. Wait a second... Forget them. I got a better idea. If I can just find the right disguise... Hey, how'd you like to make a quick hundred bucks? Here. Help! Ow! Give me back my crutches! You monster! Oh, the pain! The agony! Thanks. Don't worry about me. What's one man's pain weighed against the global injustice of corporate tyrants like EES? Go. The fight must continue. Josh. Josh Tavner. Same here! You could ride with us. Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard of an idiot savant? That's Ernie. Except for the savant part.  Ooooh, my pelvis.  Well, he's got a few problems. Well, with a script that bad, Coogan deserves an Oscar for coming off as good as he did!  I mean, that's what I read.  SLATER!? I could act circles around that one-note hack! He was shittin' his diapers when I was the toast of Broadway! I made grown men cry! I made crippled children laugh! Now all I ever hear is Slater! Slater! Slater! WELL SLATER CAN KISS MY ASS! YOU HEAR ME? You think Slater could improv like this? Make you believe he was an invalid!? Huh!?  Human worm... Dog boy... Hideous frog man. Kind of like a family reunion for you, huh? Real stupid.  Let's go. This place is dead. Nah, you seem like a regular dumbshit old redneck to me. Drop dead. We're deeply honored. But no thanks. And to think we could be in the limo with those stewardesses.  ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!? Hey! You're not supposed to have that stuff!  Let me go, Skuggs, or else! Yeah, that's me! AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGGG! Huh? AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Oh God! This was my good side!  Great use of the space. Ernie? Julie? I know that voice. That's the voice that said,  ""Cool, a freak show. Let's check it out!""  ""It's so real."" Is this real enough for you? I'm friggin' Quasimodo! Okay, here I come.  Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas yourself. You're lucky I've got a strong stomach! Get away from me you, you... No thanks. I don't plan on staying long. How many of you are there in here anyway? Huh? This is nuts. This is crazy... Besides, it was Tatum O'Neill. Get away from me. Get away! I'm not like you. You hear me? I'm Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK! It was your fault, anyway. You wanted to see the freak show. Ernie! ""So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak-- Now What?"" Forget it. Not me. I'm not like those other god-forsaken animals. Yeah. Says you.  You're right. Well that EES guy should rescue me any minute. Then it's straight to the plastic surgeon and back to sunny old L.A. I wonder how many of my beautiful, anatomically correct girlfriends will be waiting for me. Thanks, Stuey. AHH! A phantom troll!  No. In your dreams! Now get lost, troll! Arrrggg. I am Beast Boy. I will eat you. Arrrghh. (he throws down the SCRIPT) I can't do this shit! Damn it! What's keeping those guys? Well, let's see. I've been kidnapped, hideously disfigured, imprisoned with a bunch of mutant freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A., and this dialogue makes ""Hey Dude Three"" read like ""Dr. Zhivago."" So?  I'll be right there.  Thank you Worm. I don't really know how I can repay you for this.  Ha-ha! Always the wit, eh Worm? Now is the winter of our discontent, Made glorious summer by this son of York, But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor made to court an amorous looking glass, I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion, Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time, {I'M UGLY} Into this breathing world, scarse half made up, {I'M REALLY UGLY} And that so lamely and unfashionable, That dogs bark at me as I halt by them. {I'M F KIN' BUTT-UGLY, ALRIGHT!?} Why I, in this weak piping time of peace, {BLAH, BLAH, BLAH} Have no delight to pass away the time, {I NEVER GET LAID...} Unless to see my shadow in the sun, And descant on mine own deformity! {BECAUSE I'M UGLY} I'm saved! Haha! You sorry mutants are gonna rot in this hole while I'm sipping mint juleps by the pool! {AS FORTUNE SMILES O'ER MY FATE, SO DESTINY SPURNS YOUR ACCURSE'D PATE}  I mean, um, I hope you have room for all my friends, heh-heh. What are you saying!? EAT SHIT! Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in? Look! I'm sorry for what happened at the show. Can't you just forget it? You have an escape plan? What's the matter with all of you? You trust your lives to a guy just 'cause he can lick his own privates?  Fine! I'll just come up with an escape plan of my own then. I will! Forget it! I don't need you, EES, or anybody else! I'll get out of here all by myself, you... you.,. crud sucking pus monkeys! Damn.  Psst! Hey, you. Milkman! Just the man I'm lookinq for. Be a pal, and give me a hand will ya? Okay. Guess I'll just have to milk the world's biggest breasted woman all by myself. Sorry to bother you.  Ooohh... Milk me! Milk me now! Milk me hard!  I've only got two hands, all right? Geez. I don't care if Elijah did give you skim milk on the right side, chocolate on the left, and eggnog in the middle. Shit. Damn! This guy doesn't trust anybody! AHHHH! No thanks. Well, okay. (he scoops some into his MOUTH) Well, are you gonna torture me or kill me or something? But I thought I scared everyone away. Yeah, but she loves everything. Look Skuggs--Elijah--I've been in show business all my life. The public does not want to see disgusting, depraved violent filth.  This is your big plan? A dozen milkmen? Isn't that a little unusual? Fine then. Go ahead. Hope you like reggae, ya flea bitten bastard. Ah, shit. Look, you'll all be killed. You don't know about Elijah's giant Rasta eyeballs with machine guns...  It's suicide! I can't let you do it. You know how men are. Besides, it was a pretty good looking squirrel.  Julie, compared to this, sex with Julia Roberts was a thankless chore. The Laughing Man!  Holy shit! Read this. I grabbed it from Skuggs' office.  After that. Elijah's up to something big, and we have to stop him. Mmmm. Jasmine. Alright guys, listen up-- I haven't said anything yet.  Tomorrow night, at the show, I'll be turned into a homicidal monster and forced to kill you all. But we might have a chance if we act fast. And I'm prepared to be your new leader. And I've got a plan. If we can get into Elijah's lab, maybe we can-- Oh. Well-- Um, maybe-- Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I was going to say was-- Right. Well, what about-- Well, actually, I was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys, train them to fire guns, and make a break for it. But if you want to go with this other thing, I guess that's okay. Hey, look at this! It's Old Faithful! (foriegn take: ""It's the Blarney Stone!""] C'mon Ernie, let's go.  Hurry! Scrappy! It's been ten years since you chased this ball into the sewer! I thought you were gone for good! Listen Scrap. Go home. Get help. Understand? Good boy! Now go! You never know. Keep your voice down, Ernie.  Oh.... Right. You did it, Worm! Way to go!  Here, hold this.  Thanks.  Look, I've been a freak all my life.' I realize that now. Up there on that screen, humiliating myself for every fool with six bucks in his pocket-- Alright. It doesn't matter. Look, I'm talking about the ultimate human sacrifice. Hey! In case you haven't noticed, I'm about to commit a noble and selfless act here. Oops.  Okay. Let's do what we came to do, and this time, no more screw ups. No. Here goes. We have to wait. There's no way to speed up the machine. It's plugged up! You go ahead. I'll catch up. Go! Paul saved our lives! This is no time to lament over a cadaver! We've got to get moving, or we're history! Now c'mon! I said enough! Okay, listen up, everybody. We cracked the code and made the ointment we need to bring Skuggs down for good. But we left it in the lab. But wait! I found some macaroons! And there's plenty for all of us!  I don't believe it. What's Hertz doin' here? So EES is in bed with Elijah C. Skuggs, eh? Figures. Cut the crap, Hertz.  Really? AAARRGGGGHH! Holy shit. Oh no, not now, Stuey!  Hey. That's Elijah's lab!  Stuey! Are you really in the lab? Stuey! Stuey, can you hear me? I want you to try and escape. Get the cup from underneath the instrument table and bring it to me, okay? Yeah, right. Get movin'. Take the tape off your mouth, idiot! They didn't tie your hands! Great! There's no time to waste. Are you being followed? What a geek. Stuey got caught. There's no way to get the ointment before the show. No. It won't be me. It's some inhuman monster Elijah used me to create. As for me, the real me, I'll always be your friend. Before I have to rip your heads off, I'd like to say goodbye to each of you.  Worm... I'll miss your brains, the smell of your pipe, and the funny way you always go on talking until everyone wants to strangle you. Cowboy, I'll miss your good humor, your down-home wisdom, and of course, the frothy milkshakes were udderly delicious, heh-heh... Bearded... Lady... I dunno. We'll always have Paris... Nosey, I never really liked you. Frog Man, I think death is probably the best thing for you now. Ernie... Julie... I have mixed feelings.  On one hand, I'll remember you as the best friend a jerk like me ever had, and a low down repulsive slimeball. On the other hand, I really respect you, and more than that, I, uh, well, I wish we'd had the chance to boink. Today I make the proudest boast a man can utter: ""Ich bien ein Freak!"" Uh, I'm a freak. Stuey! Where are you?! Oh no! Nahh. Wait! Wait! (Elijah pauses. Rick RECONSIDERS) Nahh. AHHHHRRRGGG! And then... Sorry. Well, let's see, the other freaks were lined up in Elijah's sights, and I was about to shove a pipe through Stuey's skull, when all of a sudden, I heard a voice... Raarrrrrrgh! Maybe you'll feel this ... What antidote? If you ask me, you skimped on the coconut! Scrappy! Atta boy, Scrap! Great. But how did you-- No! It can't be! Exactly like you two, I swear. Same faces, same outfits, except they had these really big, hideous feet... Yes... Yes it is. Stuey! Thank God. You know, this adventure has taught me something.  RICK When man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earth's natural order, the only thing he'll create is havoc."
unknown,MARTIN ,Liam Neeson," I'll do this. You check in. Liz pecks his cheek, gets out. Martin leans forward. How much do we owe you? No, this is our first visit to Berlin. We're -- -- he stops short, staring at their bags, stacked on the luggage cart. He turns, tracks the their taxi, already pulling out of the drive... Tegel airport. Arrivals. Quick. The driver pulls out into traffic. The rain still heavy. Martin stares out at the wet city. Eyes track as the shadowy columns of the Brandenburg Gate pass by. He lets himself relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm. He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view. Young, female, shortish hair. Tomboy cute. Smart eyes, older than her years. Layers of clothing. GINA. She glances into the mirror, catches Martin watching her. .I wouldn't know. First time. I think you missed... He stops, smiles as he realizes she's navigated around a large construction back-up, saving them time. What do you do, when you're not...? She laughs. He smiles, nods. Okay, dumb thing to say. Sorry, I didn't mean anything -- They say your whole life flashes before you... but it's the little things... the details... the moments. Its like looking at a painting. Stand close, all you can see are the brush strokes. It's only when you step back that you get the whole picture... I... I don't... speak German... . American... A beat. Farge signals the Nurse to come in. Speaks to him slowly and clearly in English: Martin... Harris. Doctor... Martin Harris... Farge exchanges a look with the nurse. To Martin... My wife.. ? Thanksgiving... but my wife... she's in Berlin with me. Where is she? Why isn't she here? Oh, Jesus... Liz doesn't know... She'll... she'll be worried sick. Yes... yes, she does... it's... I can't remember... His voice trails off. A long beat. Farge asks gently: Thanksgiving. You told me that. I remember... almost everything. But I don't know how I got here. Another beat. He shakes his head. Scared... Yes, yes... okay. My wife...? Meine Frau... ? Beat. The nurse shakes her head, apologetic. Martin watches a FAMILY, a wife and children, pass his door, visiting another patient. He turns his head, stares at his belongings... .She gave it to me, our anniversary. The Nurse smiles, shakes her head, not understanding. Martin sets the watch down, picks up the little blue book beside the watch -- 'Horticus' -- the classic botanical reference. He flicks through it, reads the handwritten inscription: ""For Martin, that he may discover the worlds inside..."" A distant smile... Hotel Imperial... I'm here for the Forum... Doctor, I've been gone for four days. My wife is out there, in a city she doesn't know. She must be terrified... I need to find her before -- Yes, fine, but look, I know her. She's looking for me. You're married, aren't you? What would you do? Farge tracks his own wedding band. A long beat. He sighs. Not happy about this at all. .Liz? Liz! I'm here, I... A HOTEL MAID appears from the bedroom door. Startled as she sees Martin... My wife... Meine Frau... I'm looking for Mrs. Harris... She suddenly gets him... nodding, pointing down. No... I mean yes... Distracted, still looking at passing faces... I don't have it with me. My name's Harris, Dr. Martin Harris. I'm on the list. My wife is Elizabeth Harris. I'm trying to find her. I've been in the hospital. As the guard checks a screen, a crop-haired man in a cheap suit nearby tracks them: HERR STRAUSS, head of hotel security. He approaches, also checks the screen as the guard speaks to him quietly in German. I've already told this gentleman, I've been in the hospital. I was in an accident... Martin sees someone through the crowd... Professor Bressler! Words lost in the noise. Martin pushes toward him. But: That's Professor Bressler, right there. He knows me, he can confirm who I am. No, I'm done being patient... Martin stops short. Staring past them: That's her, that's my wife. Over there. By the buffet table. Seeing her. The look on his face. Processing... an overwhelming mixture of confusion and relief. That's her. That's Liz, my wife. Strauss stares at him blankly. Martin starts to lose it. Look I have been missing for four days and she has no idea what happened to me! So you need to take me to her, right now. Heads are turning. A beat. Herr Strauss mutters to the guard, then beckons Martin to accompany him inside. Liz... Liz turns fully. That beauty. A flash of surprise as she sees Martin. His clothes. The suture on his head. Oh, Jesus Liz, I -- Moving in to embrace her... abruptly she steps away from him, a flustered look of confusion on her face. Beat. Liz, I... I was in an accident. I was in the hospital, in a coma I'm so sorry, they didn't know who I was --- Liz...? Please. It's me. It's me. Martin. Your husband. Liz half smiles, glances around. Is this a joke? To the security guard, flustered: Is this some kind of a joke? -- because it really isn't funny. Do you have any idea what I've been through? I've been in the hospital for four days! Where were you? Were you even trying to find me --?! Moment's strained silence. Strauss unsure what to do, signaling a guard. Martin B steps in... -- who the hell are you!? You. Whatever you think you're doing, you need to stop it. Get out of my way --! Guard GRABS Martin's shoulder. Martin shakes him off. Guard grabs him again. Martin elbows him. A scuffle. Liz --! Please... . Martin's hauled back... away from Liz.  Great! That's the first good idea anyone's had. Call the police. Call the God damn Army!  It's not funny. I was hurt... Liz just stares at him, afraid, anchored to Martin B's arm. There! Right there! ON THE VIDEO: Slowing to real-time. Liz, arriving at reception, speaking with the Receptionist, gesturing outside. That's Liz, and I... I must have been outside, I... I can't remember. The video plays on. Liz thanks the receptionist, leaves. He's not Martin Harris. I am Martin Harris. The man downstairs is pretending to be me. He's forcing her... he must have-- This... this is insane. He stares at their faces. He calms himself, trying to get a grip. A memory resurfacing... My lab number... at Dartmouth... Call my assistant, she can verify who I am. Call her right now... He picks up a pad, scribbles down the number. Beat. The female detective picks up the phone, dials. She switches to speaker. RINGING TONE. CLICK. A recorded message... it's Thanksgiving... no one's going to be there till Monday...  Rod... Rodney Cole... he's a colleague. A friend. I know his number... 603-389-4457... Female detective dutifully dials the number. RINGING again. CLICK of a machine. Then a jovial male voice: Professor Bressler, talk to him. He's why I'm in Berlin. But it has!... That man has taken everything from me, don't you see? You have to arrest him... I told you, I was in an accident. I lost... I lost all my -- Wait, what are you doing...? The Female Detective listens to the radio response, nods to the Older Man who checks in with Strauss. Oh God... You're going to arrest me. You're going to --  I'm sorry... you're probably right. Faces look over, interested. I... the accident. I haven't been remembering things, very well. Perhaps this is just... perhaps I'm confused. Martin remembers something, fumbles in his jacket and produces Farge's card. This is my doctor, at the hospital. He warned me this might happen. I should go back there. I'm really embarrassed... Strauss LEANS in, half convinced. I... I don't know. Please, I won't be any more trouble. You can call the doctor. Please. His gaze FIXED on them as the cab starts to move again... Wait! Stop! I've changed my mind... Martin thrusts a few bills forward, steps out... Rodney it's me, Martin. Rod, I'm in Berlin for the conference, but it's Liz. She's... I'm in trouble, Rod... Phone issues a DEMAND for more money. Martin fumbles for change, drops a crumpled ball of Euros into the GUTTER. Are you going to give up? Can I help you? Hello? The guy points to his headphones, shrugs. Martin STARES at his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music seeping from the earbuds... nothing. Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods towards the back. Martin moves past college kids on Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked ""Manner,"" and what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked. So. I'm guessing he doesn't know where she is. Please thank him for his time. You know where she is. You paused. I could tell. Please, I just want to thank her. She saved my life. Biko eyes him, wary... I thought, maybe she could use my help. Maybe I could give her some money... Martin. Martin Harris. You remember me. You know who I am. She finishes the Turkish coffee, starts another. I was in your taxi. No, you do. I was in your taxi, we crashed. Why did you leave? Why didn't you talk to the police? Hey! She puts up a hand, calming him. Your friend, Biko.  It's not his fault. I told him I had money for you. No. I mean, not now. I -- Gina laughs, shakes her head, tries to push by him. He gets in her way. Eyes from around the room track. Please. Listen to me, I've been in the hospital, since the accident. My memory, it's... I don't remember what happened but something is going on and there are some people I need you to speak to. I need you to tell them what happened. Gina ducks back behind the counter. Look, things have been happening to me. I think I'm being followed. That got her attention. Her eyes lift, scan outside. You're my only link to before everything went... Yes, crazy... but it's true. You have to help me -- She rounds on him. Patience snapping. Pushes through doors, gesturing him with her into... You're not listening to me -- But you know who I am. Martin Harris, Doctor M -- But I'd just arrived. It doesn't make any sense... She raises her hands, enough. He looks at her, takes in the bruise on her face. You got hurt, too. In the crash.  Thank you. For saving my life. Thank you. No. You can't be sure how you'll act. Not until something like that happens. No. You don't understand. As I explained to the last guar -- who went home by the way -- it's not about Credit Cards. Someone has taken over my identity. Someone is pretending to be me. Here. In Berlin. Spiegler nods, sensing this won't be an easy one. Yes. They... They believe the other man. I need a new passport, papers to prove -- Spiegler sighs, a mixture impatience and sympathy. Because... Because my wife. He's staying with my wife. They must be forcing her -- Spiegler suppresses a small laugh, looks away. You don't think I know how it sounds? Let me ask you this, if my wife was having some hot and heavy affair with another man, why not just leave me? Why this? After all, we're in Europe, right? Look, I need a passport.  I need the documents that this embassy is supposed to provide. Monday?! They've kidnappedmy wife. You need to find out who this other man is, you need to be in contact with my wife -- Spiegler exhales, cuttint Martin off. He picks up Martin's Rolex, glances at the initials. Looks at his copy of 'Horticus', the inscription on the inside cover. As he does, a slip of paper comes loose, Martin picks it up. I have a meeting with Bressler... Excuse me. I need to find Professor Bressler's lab. I have an appointment at 12.30... I'm late... The female RECEPTIONIST behind the desk consults her screen. Beat. Frowns. Dr. Martin Harris. The professor knows who I am. We scheduled this meeting weeks ago. Well, we haven't met, but we've been corresponding. He invited me here to discuss my thesis. Dr. Martin Harris... She frowns, rises from the desk. Is there some sort of problem? No answer, she disappears into a back office. Martin shakes his head, exasperated. He scans the building plan on the wall... 'Bressler. L.P - Molekulare Botanik - 305'... Suddenly about-turns, heads for the stairs. The woman out of the office. SEES him. Professor Bressler... Martin B turns, sees him. His eyes harden. But it's Bressler who speaks first. Alarmed, indignant: It's all right, Professor... Professor. He is not Martin Harris. I am Martin Harris. I called the police, you sonofabitch --! Drakea Drakensis... Miss Drake was wrong... . the PLANT SAMPLE on the table behind Bressler. A single insect was attracted, but she couldn't see it. It's too small and it moves too fast. Thynnidae. It's a kind of wasp, but it looks like an ant. Only the males have wings. The orchid re-produces the pheromones of the female wasp to lure it in. It's a trick. It's pretending to be something it isn't... Bressler looks to Martin. Surprised... curious now. Martin sees his opening. Hope in his voice... We talked... you and I... on the phone... we discussed your interest in alternative forms of propagation. I told you about my father, a school teacher... his passion for science... how he passed that on to me... I said I'd like to do the same for my kids. You talked about your children... Two girls... right? Yeah... their -- His voice falters... tails off into silence. Searching his memory. Expression shifting to one of panic... You... you told me their names... I can't... I know them... I... Martin B picks up for him. Icy clarity: No! That wasn't you. Don't you remember? We spoke of how brave our wives were to marry --- I... this isn't happening... . the POLICE suddenly there. Two OFFICERS. Bressler signals for them to stay back. Martin lifts his eyes... I... I'm... He's not... A beat. Martin B shakes his head. Doctor... Do you know what it feels like, to become insane? I can tell you. Martin looks over, Farge almost RECOILS at the intensity in Martin's eyes. Fear. Loss. Anger. .and what you believe. His hand moves down his body to his chest, taps his heart. He LEANS towards Farge. .who do you think wins? Martin SMILES. Tight, hurting, fatalistic. Farge, almost afraid, nods to the nurse who slips the needle in. his mind struggles to compute. The sudden overwhelming realization that he's not insane. This man is HERE. His eyes DART as the other orderly glances over, the man from the train tunnel. Call him SMITH. He smiles at Martin, polite, nondescript. Ghostly in his disinterest. . pulls himself upright. Tries to stand, but his body is like Jello. Reaches out, grabs the leg of a steel equipment trolley which TEETERS... CRASHES to the floor, showering Martin with a CASCADE of instruments and dressings. It's okay... I'm fine... Paramedic would do something, but his colleague's YELLING at him to hurry. Just has to watch Martin go... That's where Spiegler worked for you? The secret police? I always have it with me. It was a gift from my father... Jurgen flips it open. Notices the inscription, the NUMBERS written inside the front endpaper. A beat. No. It's my wife's handwriting. My schedule... for this week. It's everything I remember. Jurgen turns over the card. German print. A cheery cartoon Uncle Sam: 'Uncle Sam's Bowling & Billiards'. My friend Rodney Cole told us to go, said it was a blast. Professor Bressler. He knows everything... They tried to kill me. Do you believe me? A beat. Jurgen pours them both another brandy. of money... ? It's all I have. I'll pay you in cash as soon as I can. Jurgen nods, picks up the watch. Turns it, looks at the engraving on the back. As Martin turns to leave... Thank you. I'm sorry. Please. I had nowhere else to go... She starts to respond, holds it back. Nods. I just need to know. The man you picked up, the man who's life you saved. That was me, right? It was me. She looks down at him, moved. Eyes track his wedding ring. I... don't know. .Five years. Yale... I was a teaching assistant. Liz heard me lecture. .You don't have to believe me. It's crazy, I know. Gina pauses, stares through chain-link at the cars below. I'd still have my memories. Thank you. He takes a sip. Then another. Gina watching him. Muffled TV and arguing VOICES in Turkish from the floor below. Oh. I'm sorry, I just... I'm sorry. Did you do these? No, you're right...  I'm sorry. They're beautiful. You should -- Your eyes... It's the one thing I remember about the accident. Your eyes in the mirror... He tails off. Face-to-face... BANG! BANG! Pounding on the door. Gina motions Martin out of sight as she opens the door... .It's Biko, the soft-spoken Somali taxi-driver. He grins. Tries teasingly to peek past her into the apartment. I'm... I'm just going... in here. Biko looks at Gina, raises an eyebrow. No, look! She tracks his gaze: Down below, Jones exits the building, looks up amidst other onlookers. Wipes blood from his face. Martin looks around, wild, for anything, his gaze settling on: the far wall. Flames FLARE in, growing. We have to go up... He starts to pull her, but she's FROZEN, staring in horror. Martin tracks her gaze: Biko's body, tucked under the stairs. Lifeless eyes stare back. The keys. Where are the keys? Gina stares at him, lost. Martin reaches into her pockets. Finds Biko's keys. He HAULS broken panes, debris off the car, manages to get it open. He bundles her inside. C'mon. C'mon... IN THE REARVIEW: The Range Rover, making a U-Turn, heading their way... C'mon...! Running side-by-side. Train horn BLASTS as they cross right in front of it as the Range Rover, cut off, SPINS 90 degrees, races down the tracks alongside it. Martin and Gina scramble across tracks, towards a tunnel... . the Range Rover passes the back of the train. HARD right, over the tracks. Too Fast. The car catches air... . BELLIES down hard onto the next set of tracks. Front tire EXPLODES... . Range Rover SPINS... rear wheels SLAM into the track. Another tire BURSTS. Scraping STOP, car straddling the rails. Jones shifts into reverse. Rims SPIN against metal. Gina... .Yes. I think so... I don't remember... how it felt exactly. She approaches him, leans in so she can see his eyes... .For the same reason I would. If I thought it was the only way to protect her. Gina nods, distant. Martin presses on, difficult. I keep having a dream. Liz is in the bedroom of our home, although it's different somehow. Her hair's different... she's smiling, about to say something. Then it ends. I can remember places, details... I just can't remember... how I felt. He stops. Just the low pulsing BEAT from the other room The lights revolving over them. Gina watching him. Looking back at her. That connection again. He looks away. She shakes it off, produces a borrowed joint, offers it to him. He shakes his head no. She shrugs, sparks it. Inhales deeply, eyes close. She leans back. You'll need to get out of town. There's a man who's helping me. He can -- We're you... I won't let anything happen to you. I'll protect you. She opens her eyes again, looks up at him, smiles, on her way to sleep. Thank you for coming. Martin glances around, edgy. Jurgen watches him, glances at Gina long enough to let Martin know he's spotted her.  I... I didn't do it. Jurgen studies him, hard. Looks back at Gina. These numbers, are a code. The first number refers to the page of a given book. The second to a specific line on that page. The third number to words on that line. If I didn't have the exact edition of the book, the code would be unbreakable. That's where it breaks down -- the words are the Latin names of two plant species... Calochortus Albus... and Umbellularia Californica. Fairy Lantern... and California Bay. Both common flowering plants... ""The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination."" Correct. Yes. Look -- In a way... they're opposites. Bressler wants to end world hunger. Open research... universal access to all his data on crop cultivation... They're both progressives. Fahad knows we'll need food long after oil. New agricultural patents are worth billions... He's got balls, that's for sure. Another beat. Jurgen slides the 'Uncle Sam' bookmark card from the pages of the 'Horticus'... turns it over, Martin's remembered schedule scribbled on the back. It's in our suite. Champagne and hors d'oeuvres for Bressler and a few of his guests. Yes. Bressler invited him... Martin trails off. Starting to get there... Oh, Jesus... You can't -- Jurgen flips his notebook shut. Gets up. Jurgen may have nothing.  I need your help. Yes, hello, this is Dr. Harris. I have a message for Dr. Bressler... .The zoo. She loves Polar Bears. I never knew exactly why. Gina nods, looks over to the restaurant. Looks back at Martin who hasn't moved. She checks her watch. This shouldn't take long. I just need to see what Bressler wants. Liz's gaze settles on the painted sign for the zoo. Standing across from her in this protected space. A strange numbness. Doesn't know where to start... . Liz. Just that syllable. She stares back, features tense. Liz. What's happening? Why --?: I have to know why, Liz. Are they making you do this? Are they threatening you? The zoo. The Polar Bears. You can't what? Come with me, right now. We can Who are they? She shakes her head, tormented. My case...? She closes on him. A wave of emotion as she's almost in his arms, her hands on his face, searching his eyes. Cuts up a small path rising up from the Polar Bear area. At the top he turns, hiding himself, looking back. .Nothing he can do now. He turns away, moves to the top of the path where Gina waits for him. They walk in silence... The combination. For the lock. It's 2... 8... 0... 6... A beat. The woman and Gina both looking at Martin. The woman enters the numbers. The locks pop open. She lifts the lid, picks something up. A pause... then her expression softens. She turns it toward Martin... gazing at it. He runs his fingers over its dock-eared corners, every bump and crease. Looks up to find Gina watching him. A long, awkward pause. She reaches over. Takes the photo from him. Studies it. .Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. She's my wife. She's in danger. I have to -- No, wait. I meant what I said. We can take care of you. I can get you money, arrange -- Gina stops, turns. A beat. Sadness, anger. Rodney? What are you doing here? Yeah... but how did you know --? What are -- ? What the hell Rod! You're my oldest friend! You know who I am. It's me... it's not that other guy. He's not -- No... That's insane. Liz, she---- That's not... she... But... I... who am I...? A pause. Cole shakes his head, pats him on the cheek. Wait! WAIT! Martin breaks free, walks unsteady to the rear of the van, locks eyes with Cole, trapped, clawing towards the back... Martin puts a hand out... and takes his briefcase. Is it true...? Stares down at the wreck. Mind spinning... Gina comes up, touches his shoulder. . Jurgen... we were going to meet... I have to see him. I have to! Martin's face. Blood streaking in the rain. Absolute. A long beat. Gina takes a deep breath. he told me I'm one of them... the things he said... the things he said I've done...  How can I be that person? Thank you. No... No... No! Leave me alone. He stumbles away, pushing towards the bathroom. No... I made him up... I made him up to kill a man I've never met. Prince Fahad is going to be assassinated today. There's a bomb in the suite. I put it there. A long beat. Gina's eyes meet his, brief, scared. Sudden shift. Martin stuffs the cash back in the bag. Grabs her by the arm, propels them both outside... Take this... get out of Berlin. Gina shaking her head. Take it and go! Get as far away from me as you can. .Is this what you want? Is this the person you still want to help. Pure instinct and adrenaline. Gina grabs the bag, stumbles across the street, HORNS BLARE as cars swerve to avoid her... And she's gone. You're not listening! There is a bomb, in the Eisenhower Suite. I put it there. I've told you! There's no time to explain this... Do it. NOW. Do it or many people will die. I'm not lying. A beat... Strauss nods to one of his technicians who starts to type into a console... There! Stop! The technician freezes the image: A dapper couple, checking in. He wears a sportsjacket, light-haired, horn-rimmed glasses. She's got short dark hair. Martin points. Strauss leans in, sensing it. Lily, Laurel... The smile... dying. Realization... Bressler's daughters... Lily. Laurel... Calochortus albus... Umbellularia Californica... Flowers... Passwords... He SCANS the many monitors, LOCKS onto: Liz, moving down a corridor, purposeful. Fahad was never the target. It's Bressler! You have to tell Strauss! They're after Bressler! Gina1 Gina! MARTIN is moving, pressing through crowds. No... I won't do it... Bringing the Vun up, pointed at Bressler's head, perfect kill shot. No choice. Finger on the trigger... Don't. Keep your hands where I can see them. Please... GROANING from the hotel structure. Plaster and cables fall, SPARK across the floor. Martin FLINCHES, tries to keep steady. Liz is steady, cool. Laughs a little. Let go of the knife, Liz. Please, just stop, Liz... Her face, reading him. His fear, his uncertainty... She smiles, just a little... Liz throws the knife! Martin FIRES as the blade sinks into him, sending him reeling back onto the floor. His hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder, SCREAMING in agony as he rips it out, looking up at... They say your whole life flashes before you... but it's the little things... the details... Gina reaches out, takes Martin's arm. Draws him closer. I don't know who I am now, what I would have done. But one thing's for sure... I'm not the man I was. And I'm going to try my best to find some sort of redemption, for what he did. Because maybe, just maybe... Slowly we LOSE THEM among the sea of bobbing heads... I can become the man I was always meant to be."
jaws,BRODY ,Roy Scheider," How come the sun didn't used to shine in here? Right. Probably out in the back yard. The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound? Give me 30 years, I'll get it. Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one! Feed the dogs.  I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it. On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did? Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh? Sexy, hm? What was I before?  I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes. Let's see... Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... Well, what do they usually do, float or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll meet both of you at the beach in  ...20 minutes, okay? Okay.  First goddamn weekend of the summer.  The office. Here? You gotta be kiddin'. Love ya. Christine what? You picked her up on the ferry. And nobody else saw her in the water? Think she might've run out on you? You from around here? You here for the summer?  What d'you pay for a place just for the summer? Pretty stiff. Maybe that's your girl. If this is going to work, you've got to keep current stuff out here, and put 'closed' files in there. The 'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay? Jesus, Santos. Polly, I want to know what water recreation is on for today.  Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs? Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?  Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing. Do I need any more authority? Now tell me something I don't know. So we should set out a smorgasbord? What else could've done that?  Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was! I was only reacting to what I was told. I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.  What?  How's the water? Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water... Michael! Sean! Out of the water. Everybody out of the water! Michael! Get out! Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering. I'm responsible for public safety around here...  I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police... I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland. Larry and I have also decided to close the beaches for a short time. I didn't agree to that! Love a cup of tea. With lemon. Where is he? Son! -- Out of the water now!  I want him out of the ocean.  Michael! Come inside! I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself... That wasn't funny. Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer. Hey! You know how many men that's supposed to hold? What you got ain't safe. You take some guys off or you don't go out. You going out too, Ben? Just back up! No, the other way! Cut it to your left! Your other left! The big boat, your front end is out way too far. Little boat, stay still! Thanks. If that's dynamite, give it here, or don't leave port. Hand it over. You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy. Who are you? Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident. No, it was local jurisdiction. No, we just checked the beach...  You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this? Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him! Sure he is. Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute. What d'ya mean? Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.  She's right. I'm going home. C'mere and give Daddy a kiss. Because he needs it. Swell. How come you have to tell them that? Let's all have a drink. You too, sweetheart... Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach? Something else. Do most attacks go unreported? There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh... Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts? And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing? Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not. I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come? What stinks so bad? What's that? What? What?! How can you tell? He ate a car? What do we do? Chum? What is all this stuff? Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around? Where'd you get all this? You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job? We gotta get back soon... Hey! What the hell? That's Ben Gardner's boat! It's the Flicka! Ben? Ben! What happened? Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat? Why don't we just tow it in? Be careful, for chrissake. You all right? No shark did that to a boat! There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater. There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island. A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake! We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up. He lost it on the way up. We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have. That means closing the beaches. Wait a minute! I need you. Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August. What is this? I signed on the wrong line... I want to thank you guys from local agencies for cooperating, and I hope we won't actually be needing your services. But I'm glad to have you here.  We're all on one channel, so let's keep radio traffic to a minimum, okay? I wish it would rain... I'm sorry, I just don't have the time. Hey Mikey -- ! You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son? Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds. Just a favor for your old man. Everybody out! Out of the water, please -- leave the water, please -- No whistles! No whistles!  He's in shock. Get blankets!  Here --  Take him home. No. Home here.  Got a pen on you? There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.  I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead. Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that? The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs. Just sign it, Larry. This has got to be one big violation... What? I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000. You got it. You got it. You got it. Two cases. And dinner when you land. This is Matt Hooper... He's from the Oceanographic Institute.  Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there... It's my charter. My party. You got it.  Colorful, isn't he? Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this. Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. Tell 'em I went fishin'! Who's driving the boat?  Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there? You got it? The wire's showing! What's the point with hooks and Lines? --  How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking? What do we do? Get some help? Radio in? How're we gonna handle this? Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow. Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...  C'mon. Middle appendix --  What's that one, there? What's that, a ship? What the hell? Where...? The barrel!  Shark! Starboard!  That's it! Radio in for help!  Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call. Some great idea! Now where are we? Some goddamn skipper you are. You're certifiable, y'know that? You're a real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!  Did you get him in the head? I can't stand here doing nothing! What about us? Where'd he go? Have you ever had one do this? There! He's trying to sink us! He's chasing us! I don't believe it.  You gotta go in the water... He's taken him! No... (notices something O.S.) You think we can get back with those? What day is this? Think the tide's with us? Y'know, I used to hate the water..."
life,RAY ,Eddie Murphy," Is Spanky here? Then what's the problem? But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now? Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie? I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too. When do you get off? I sure can't drink that watered-down swill you're serving. Give me a glass of ice.  You have any of that French stuff? Keep the change. Don't I know you? Sure I do. What's your name again? Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.  That's right! Good old Monroe... Sorry, man. My mistake. Watch the threads, Bullethead. If this is about my tab, I've got it covered. Save your energy, Claude. You're gonna need it. Here, this belongs to you. (tossing Claude his wallet) It was empty when I found it. What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny? Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt. Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier. I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man. You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb. You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with. Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out. Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself. Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner. All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving. Understood. I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind. I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full. Tell me about that hot sketch you were hypin' last night. She was a choice bit of calico. You two been seeing each other a long time? Gonna slap the handcuffs on her and stroll down the aisle one of these days? Sometimes I wish I could find me a sheba to settle down with. Suppose I'm just a tomcat by nature. (trying to fill the silence) This little rum run is gonna seriously improve my relationship with Spanky. He's a good man to have on your side. He's got the capital and the connections. That's what you got to have in that business. Spanky's place is pretty plush, but one of these days I'm gonna open up my own establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room. You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room. That's in the groove, don't you think? Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation. Start your job? What kind of job? That's some long green. Nothing. I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me. Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time. Why didn't you take it? You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that. You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller. A loan officer? So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you? How would I get a loan, anyway?  Like this? My daddy gave me this watch. My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time. Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room. When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me? I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut. Man, something smells good in here. How's everybody doing? Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there. Good evening, Billy. We'd like some coffee and a couple of slices of that homemade pie you've got advertised. It says so right there on your shirt. Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way. Got any nigger pies?  Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude. You're soft. I said you're soft. I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft. Yeah, I want some pie. How you doing? We're looking for Slim. Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim? Blacks welcome there? Maybe we will. Nice meeting you. What gave you that idea? Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking... What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward. There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash. There's your gas money. You stay here and watch the truck. And don't worry, I've got the keys. I'll take two. Looks like my sugar bowl's empty, Mr. Hancock. Now, hang on, slick. I ain't through with you yet. Full boat, ladies doing the paddling. Looks like he had a whole lot of nothing in his hand until you came along. Here I am. Still got that ten dollars? That jelly you were talking to right here? So you made a generous contribution. That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight. While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes. He even got my daddy's watch. We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money. He's dead. It ain't here. My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about -- Him? He's just drunk. Winston. His name's Winston. Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck. Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed. If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  ""I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."" Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York. Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean. I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice. Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life! I wouldn't do that if I was you. Told ya. We noticed. Here, gimme that. It's from your mama's neighbor, Mrs. Tidwell. She thought you oughta know that your second cousin Bo died. And your other cousin, Sally, on your daddy's side, she died. Apparently, your sister died. No, it says Marleen here. Oh, wait, looks like Jenny died, too. Then it goes on for a while about how the crop didn't come in on accounta the frost.  She finishes up with something about a tornado and how your mama and your daddy died in that. But don't worry none. She'll take care of the dog. That is, if it gets over the worms. Anybody else need anything read? Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year. He does it all by himself. What is that? Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there? Stop aggravating people. Just eat your food. The fork is the least of your worries, Claude. What's your name? What are you in for, Willie? What about you, Radio? You killed Santa Claus? I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming... He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit. (thumbing down the table) How 'bout him down there? You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place? Greenville, that the nearest town? Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway? Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails. My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread. I thought my mama made good corn bread but this is really something special. Who knew I'd have to come all the way down to this here prison, deep in the asshole of the great state of Mississippi, to find such a tasty piece of corn bread? And who knew that in this great corn bread-making institution I'd come face to face with the biggest, ugliest, stinkiest, ugliest gold- mouthed negro in the entire world. Now get out of my face before I lose my appetite!  Shit, Goldmouth. Back in New York, I know bitches who hit harder than you. Got him good, huh, Claude? He won't be bothering us anytime soon. Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in? I'm talking about a haircut. They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too. Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is. That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town. Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages. Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream. Mama? What are you doing here, mama? Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg. This is a big surprise, mama. I sure didn't expect to see you down here. Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall. I can't take that, mama. I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy. They gave me life, mama. Cookie drew me a map to Greenville. You know what I'm saying. That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there. What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this. You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here. What does that mean? I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan. You mean the Boom-Boom Room? You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun. I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint. Satchmo. He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town. Yeah, things were hot last night, but you'll never guess who's playing tonight. That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.  C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door. Made just for you, Cookie. No problem. Oh, boy! How about some Worchestershire sauce! And clean that damn table. C'mon, Poker Face, what's a club without some dice?  Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law. I'm sure it don't.  Claude. What do you want, Claude? My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet. Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude? Yeah. We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh? On your behalf. What happened to we? Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard. You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me? At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship. I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft. I said you're soft. -- we'll spend a night in the hole. We heard this shit before. New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay? Absolutely. The map is very clear. Cookie didn't draw it. I did. I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map. I'm stuck! Hey, Claude. I just want to say thanks for coming back for me.  Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now... Claude? You alright?! Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure. All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon. We'll just get off at the next stop. That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now. We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street. Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox. I don't know. Who do you want? Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats? They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh? Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.  Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.  You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.  Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!  If you step outside the gun line without my permission, you will be shot. If you trip and fall over the gun line, you will be shot. If you spit, if you pee, if you stick your ass out and take a dump over the gun line, you will be shot... What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent. You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot. Can't be worse than any of these other fools. Told ya. Judge must have money riding on the championship. You shred it, wheat. That there is fresh water. Be cool, man. You can look, just don't drool. Come on, the world hasn't changed that much. So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy? We're like his handlers. He can't function without us. Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that. Whatever. The baby's mine, boss. Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him. These are free papers. Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep. It's 1945. It's a different world now. Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would. Hey, Biscuit...! It's a pardon from the governor. Let it go, Claude. Make 'em throw strikes. One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place. He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it. I don't see you coming up with any plans. Crop duster. My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going. Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks. Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret. Well, if that's the way it is... Then I have nothing left to say to you. Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.  I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you. You don't want to give me a gun, boss. I'm liable to use it on you. Excuse me? Are you talking to me? After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be. I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all. That was five years ago. We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me. You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you. I always wanted to do that.  There is so much love inside of this man. You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something? Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on? You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing. What the hell are you doing? You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?  Damn, it was getting hot in there. You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you? Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk. Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here. (Ray struggles out of the trunk) We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go! Back to New York for starters. This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys. Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys. Don't make me take them away from you. You sure it was him? I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now. I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one. That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune. Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it? Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years? She give you that scar, too? Like you shot Winston Hancock? That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you. I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head. He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike. That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me. He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it. No, I'm gonna kill him -- That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun. I said you're soft. I believe this is mine. He knows nobody wants to hear the truth. Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection. Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment. Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody. They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey. Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right. You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging... I wouldn't be putting that shit up my nose. That came in in somebody's ass. It's like you're sniffin' ass. Maybe that's your thing, but it ain't mine. I got three stool softeners left.  That oughta be right up your alley. Hey, where you going? We got money on the table here! Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here? Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway. It's too late for plans. Hey, man, cover that shit up! Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude! He must still be in there. It'll be too late. I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me. Why the hell not? Just put some mustard on it and eat it. Gimme that damn thing. Have my ice cream. Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude? So? If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead. Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats. Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance. I'm sorry, he's on medication..."
kids,TELLY ,Leo Fitzpatrick," You know what I want to do? What do I want to do?  Why? Because your a virgin? You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff. Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it. I don't know. I just think that you would love it. What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.  You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.  Of course I do.  Virgins. I love 'em. No diseases, no loose as a goose pussy, no skank. No nothin. Just pure pleasure.  Was up bitch? What do you think?  Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon. Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck. Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow. Did what take? Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time. But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good. Take a whiff. Hell's yeah. She was so clean. You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom. You know what else? I can tell that she had just entered puberty. Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right. And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cut when you were little. And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup. And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby. And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl. I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit. Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies. I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.  That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen. I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect. Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys. What do you want? Are you hungry? You wanna go to Paul's house? I'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer. I don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us out. Probably. 78th. Yeah. A little bit. But I didn't really want her to. I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy. I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost. Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it. Yep. You thirsty? You got any money? You down with the boost? Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg? Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it? Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg. I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg? The cartoon? Yeah. Right. Right.  Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.  Can I do it? I just brooke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire. It's me. Telly.  Paul it's Telly. Open up. Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to. Nah. So, how many people live here now? Where does everyone sleep? Jennie who? Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to? But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic. I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know. No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends. All I know is that condoms suck. They don't work. They break. They slip off. It's impossible to feel anything. They make your dick shrink. But I still use 'em. Or at least I did once. Yep. He looks like my uncle. I wanna fuck Darcy. Darcy. Benny's little sister. Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now. Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent. It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember? She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her. I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt. And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on. I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection. At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin. I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her. I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me. I guess so. I gotta stop off home too. I don't understand why you do that. That. Yeah. Why you give money. That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do. Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by. So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks. Right. Shut up. Good luck? Hi mom. We were out trying to find a job. I don't know. Find a job.  Hey can I borrow some money? But then I won't need your money. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Twent, twenty-five, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty. I don't know. How much do you want? Fifteen for me. Ten for you. Get the fuck out of here cat! You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight? Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park. You are? You want some? Why not? You stink. Mom.  I'm gonna go out for a little while. Not too late. Not too late. Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks. All right. None of that twigs and pebbles shit. You think so? He still does. It's not his fault. He had a hard life. You've heard the stories right? Well, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission from his teacher to leave school early and go home. So he walks into his house and hears some strange noises. The noises were coming from upstairs. In his parents room. So, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a little kid and he wasn't sure what to do. So he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used to cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with. So he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in trouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed. Like someone was kicking her in the head. So Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski mask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old kid. And he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second he just looks and watches. And you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything to happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and over. But it was a mistake. So Casper killed his father. He came home with a stomachache and ended up murdering his pops. It was a very embarrassing thing. So that's why Casper is how he is. Yep. No. I was just kidding. I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office. Uh oh. Casper's in the mix.  Darcy!!!  Darcy!!!  Hey Bennie. What's up? Is your sister home? Yeah. Hold up man. Hey. What are you doin right now? Don't take a bath. Come swimmin with us! Come on. Come swimmin with us. Yeah. Come on. I hope so. For now. I like 'em new. Not like you. You look nice. Is it cold? You know I've been thinking about you lately. Yeah. After I saw you last week. Yeah. I was lookin for you all day today. Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up. I was like. I gotta find Darcy. Where is she at? I was lookin all over. Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you? She won't? Why not? Yeah. I can understand that. You should come back with me to Steven's house. Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out. Come on. You can rave on another night. Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug  out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise. Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring. Do you like kissing me? Do you like me? I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed. I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head. No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all. Hey Steven. Yo Steven. Come on man. Steven. Yo, let me get in your parent's room man.  Just fir a litte while. Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please. OK. Trust me. Don't be nervous. I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it. I just know. I know you'll love it. I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about. Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me. I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle. Of course I do. That's it. You're doin fine. Come on Darcy. That's it. Shut the fucking door!!! When you're young. Not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got. When your young. A lot of the time fucking is all you have, hen you go to sleep at night, you dream of pussy. When you wake up, it's the same thing. It's in your face, in your dreams, you can't escape it. Sometimes when you're young, the only place to go is inside. That's just it. Fucking is what I love. Take that away from me, and I really got nothin."
breakdown,JEFF ,Kurt Russell," Done.  Sniper. High-rise. Top floor.        Window in the middle. He sees her. I said he sees her.  No... no... Sniper!   Sniper! Sni-- Me too.  This is it. Sure. There's nothing to talk about. I told you. I quit.   Walked out. end of story. You don't understand... It was different this time. I talked to Reynolds.  He thinks I could still get the job at the San Diego station. Think of it. Low pressure, a steady paycheck. So I shoot city council meetings -- how bad could it be? Who's running? It's good money, full benefits. I'm tired of freelance. We could finally put some money in the bank. Throw what away? Don't you get it? I don't do anything. I sit, I watch, I film -- I let it happen. No, Amy.   It's my excuse. That girl... it's like I was paralyzed. I wanted to do something, but I didn't. I just stood there and watched her get killed. Please, babe, I need this.     Say yes and we'll take as long    as you want -- drive cross-country    and make a vacation out of it.     What do you say? Sorry.     I took my eyes off the road. I'll pull over next chance we get.  Sorry... Thanks. I guess. Is that right? Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you. You pulled out in front of me. How about if we just forget it, okay? I'm sorry it happened. I don't want any trouble. Nothing. Guy in the truck. Thinks I tried to hit him. C'mon, let's go. Later.   Just get in. No, let's just go. I told you. Nothing.  The guy was an asshole. What'd you get? You kidding. It's probably gourmet cuisine around here. I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty cents each and pay off this car. I don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm not -- Sonofabitch!! My camera!        He stole my camera! The redneck at the gas station! He lifted it right under my nose! My brand new Nikon. (pounds wheel in frustration) Goddammit. What's the use. He's probably halfway to Bumblefuck now, the bastard. What the hell? Nothing.   I -- Hang on -- I can't steer! Ow! I'm fine.  I said I'm fine, okay? What's it look like?      I'm trying to fix the car. What?  Look, I really don't want to go into this right now. I'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. So could we maybe just fix the -- Christ, not these guys... Asshole... What the hell? I don't know. Yeah.   Our car broke down. Thanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy, you want to steer? Think you could radio a tow truck for us? How far is that?  Oh. It's a new car. Nice     of you to offer. But we've got a     lot of stuff in the car. I think     we're better off waiting for a cop     to come along. We don't know this guy. Amy, I've got my equipment in the car. All our stuff. What if those guys come back and we're not here? (turns away, quietly to himself) Jesus... don't be stupid... What do you think you're doing?  You're not riding with that guy. End of story. Oh for Christ's sake... Excuse me. I was supposed to meet my wife here. Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt. Benetton shirt. It would've been within the last half hour. She might've been with a trucker? Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving an eighteen wheeler. You sure? Could she have left a message with another one of your employees? I don't understand. Is there another Belle's Diner?  Shit. Excuse me, how far is the next town? Look, if my wife comes in -- her name is Amy -- tell her I was here. Tell her to stay put till I get back, not to move. Would you do that, please? C'mon, you fat-ass.    Pull over. Pull over!    Pull over! I was signaling you to stop. Didn't you see me? Where's my wife? My wife.     Where is she? I checked at the diner.      No one saw her there. You gave her a ride. You were supposed to drop her at Belle's diner. How can you not remember? It was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes!  Your radio works --  What the hell are you doing -- ? Amy?    Amy?!   You in there? I want my fucking wife, is what I want! What have you done to her?! Officer, I need your help! I don't know, this guy has my wife! I don't know what the hell's going on. Last time I saw her she was with this guy in his truck. Now he's saying he's never seen her! Don't lie, you son of a bitch! Our car broke down. This guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone.    But she never showed up. He's lying!  Are we gonna keep looking or what?  Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's it? You're not going to question him anymore?  Go to hell, you sonofabitch -- It was him.    It was this truck. No. I wasn't paying attention. What does that have to do with anything? I don't believe this... My wife did not leave me. This is insane. You're just going to let him go? I want your name and badge number. Don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit. I'm noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52 A.M. Two months old. Yes. Did she come in? You didn't see her, or she didn't come in? Amy? I want to see your order slips. You write down the names.   I want to see them. If my wife came in here, then her name's in that pile. Let me see the fucking slips. Please, I need the phone -- I have to call the police! How'd you know? Did you see her? Please, if you know something, anything, tell me. What?    When? No one's going to hurt you, Billy. Just tell me what you saw. Yes... Another truck? With who? Do you know where they went? Where by the river? Who doesn't? The bartender?      The men in the truck? Billy, I need you to come to the police. If you tell them what you saw, they'll be able to help me. C'mon... work, goddammit... Fuck.  Yes. Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor... Listen, I -- don't put me on hold! I need a favor... I've gotta talk to that friend of yours at the F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's missing -- I said Amy's been -- Fuck! Yes, I'm still here.       No -- don't call back -- Steve?!       Steve?! Goddammit! Shit!  Where is she? There's some... yeah...  I don't -- there's different accounts... the balance fluctuates...  Ninety thousand.  Ninety thousand dollars.  What do you want? You sonofabitch -- How do I know she's still alive? I need to see the manager. I need a wire transfer from my bank in Boston.  What? Right. Here's my driver's license, credit card if you need it, my account number in Boston... How long is this going to take?  Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account only has $5,000 in it. How much can you advance me on my credit card?  My credit card. I've got a $6,000 limit. Can you advance me the whole $6,000? Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer the money, okay? Look, I'm going to tell you something. Whatever happens, just keep filling out that form, okay? There are people watching -- Just... transfer the money. Would you tell the manager I want the money in these denominations? I'm here. The whole thing. Ninety thousand. When do I see my wife? No.   First you tell me where she is. I gave you the money.     Now let her go. What the hell -- Where is she, goddammit?   What'd you do with her? Where is she?! You like that?     How about this? Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you sonofabitch! You want to try 'em again? How about an emergency stop? You want to try that, Earl? Where is she? Fuck you, you don't! Is that what you want? You really want me to stop? 'Cause I bet this baby stops on a dime! End of the line, Earl! How about it? You gonna tell me? Yeah?     Where's that? Where were you taking the money? Where? I know where she is!   My wife! You don't understand!      She's been kidnapped! Officer, please. You gotta listen to me --  Hello? Can you hear me? This is Jeff Taylor. I need to talk to the deputy. The name is Jeffrey Taylor. I just witnessed your sheriff being shot. Now put someone on, goddammit! Hello? Amy?   Amy, can you hear me?  Amy? Hang on, baby. They're in the house; I can't use the lights. I'm gonna get you out. Fuck! It's not working. If I make any more noise, they'll hear. I'm going to get you out of there, Amy. I love you.  Please, God, let her still be alive.  Fuck you, asshole. Give me the key. Give me the fucking key! Don't mister me, you sonofabitch! My wife is locked in a hole in your fucking barn! You don't give me the key, I'll blow your fucking head off!  Your husband's a kidnapper and a murderer is what's going on! Did you know that about him? Huh?  Ever wonder where all this stuff comes from? You don't want to do that, kid. Just put the gun down. Put the gun down. I understand that, Deke. I'm not gonna hurt Mommy. But if you pull that trigger, there's a chance I'll still kill your father. No, Deke, don't listen to him. He's wrong. Deke, no -- ! Don't fucking move! Deke?   Deke?   Get on your feet! It's okay, kid. Go over there, stand next to your mother. Hurry up. Okay... on your feet.   Now, everybody! Let's go.      Out.  Okay. Reach into your pocket and hand the key to your wife.  Do it.  Okay, now unlock it. Good.  Now give me the keys.  Deke, push the door open. Quickly. That's enough, Deke. (gesturing them inside with gun) Let's go. Move it. Deke, I need you to open this. It's okay, Deke. There's a freezer down there with a woman in it. I need you to let her out.  Deke!    You at the freezer? Okay. You're almost done. Just open it up, let the woman out. You got that Swiss Army knife your dad gave you? Good man. Use that.   Make sure you don't hurt her.  You better pray she's all right. Amy!!! Amy, come up here! I know, baby. It's okay.       They can't hurt you now.  Okay.    Everybody in the cellar. Do it! Go to hell. Let's get out of here. Amy, no!    It's not safe -- One of them's still loose.      C'mon -- this way! Hello?   Hello?     Anybody home?  Hello? Anyone home? C'mon, c'mon...  Take it. We may need to get out of here -- (into phone, suddenly) Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I'm reporting an emergency... I don't know the address, the house belongs to a Red Barr -- I mean, Warren something... No, I don't know his name! No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's locked in a barn... Jeffrey Taylor. If you contact the police in -- Amy?! C'mon! What the fuck?! Get down! It's glass!   Use the rifle! Hang on! You all right? Yeah? What is it? What do you mean? C'mon, Amy, push! Push, goddammit! C'mon, Amy, it's all you now... you can do it... I won't, baby... I won't ever let you go... How's the sheriff? What about the leader? Name it."
metro,ROPER ,Eddie Murphy," Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl... Dig in, Cozy Girl...  Roper go. I'm en route. E.T.A. in five. Stay up there, Girl... Where's the damn wire?! SHIT! Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post? ...a car. ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes... What's the suspect's name? Hello, guys. Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl? They're not usually graduate students. What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week? We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor? I have to go face to face. You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there. He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence. We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone. We gonna stand here and talk about it or let the guy in there bleed to death.  Give me a dozen donuts. Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna donut? I ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a -- I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry a weapon. I need to get something straight first. Who's the manager? When did you start keeping longer hours? Really! Because I've been thinking of moving to this branch. It would be really convenient for me -- It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you. I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to do this the right way. First I need you to point that gun away from --  What's your name? Point the gun away from Debbie. Alright! But let's be clear about one thing. If you kill someone, I can't help you. The SWAT guys will take you out. Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City... How ya doin'?  ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway. Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals. He didn't kill anybody, though. This is gonna hurt. It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing. I'll be right back, Earl. Point that gun away from Debbie.  Give me your gun. I haven't had to shoot anyone in three years. Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody. As a rule, I need one hostage released as show of good faith. Give me Debbie. The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie. You're gettin' the car. You two, leave. That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going to get your car. Oh, there's one last thing. You want a convertible or hardtop? Hardtop.  Manual or automatic? You got it. Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I can't live without you. This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you. I worship you. Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name. Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair. Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters. Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.  This Greg is really getting in my way. Please. I'm begging you. Hey, that's my car. Hey, Baffert, what's the story for tonight? You're my hero. Deal. Tell him to give me a raise. What? Depends. What's up? Define concern. Your concern is heartwarming. Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside? Let me see that. Tested high on his intellectual aptitude... Not as high as me but... National marksman finalist... Attended N. Y. C... Went to college. Very impressive. F.B.I. sniper school... Mayorial commendation. ""Additional Skills"": Biathelete, marathoner, lip-reading, speaks Spanish... Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks. Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation? The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress... Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.  And a car. You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.  The car is part of the deal. Repoed this morning. And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...  Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard nothing but good things about you... You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator. Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende? We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin? You ever been in a hostage situation? How do you feel after a shooting. It rarely has to be done. SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know. Try to remember that. Okay, ""Dead Eye"", lesson one... Extract that pen cap without touching or moving the bottle. A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow. ""Phoney Frank""? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar. Yeah, okay. You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization. It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett. Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out. Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up. Then he didn't say 742. He must have said 724 or something, because this can't be right. Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not riding in this shit. I can't roll in no shit like this. Fuck the stereo. What's that smell? You want me to go up with you? Good. I don't want to be late. You want anything on the game? It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.  Get an ambulance!  I want to be put on this case.  I want to be put on this case. Who's running it? Who's running it! Hey, hey, hey... Anything on Korda so far? I don't give a damn what Solis said.  If you get a lead, I want to know. Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy. I'm not drunk. Yet. You heard. Can I come in? That a new picture? Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy?  He heard my voice. How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. You miss me? He misses me. I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone. It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him. I've proved that, didn't I? Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work. Something I guess I can't have anymore.  You think I didn't need you? Ronnie... You expecting someone? This day just keeps getting better. I was just leaving.  What do you got on Korda?  Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration? How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits. And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.  You guys are doing good work. I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that. I don't see much progress here. Very nice... You get an ""A"". Notice... No force required. No damage. So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco? Recruited you from where? With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here? You don't like New York? You'd never been out of New York? How did you like Toronto? You're a real excitable sort, aren't you? I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for ""fast advancement"". I'm not sure. Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version. Which apartment? How are we gonna get him out of there?  Have you evacuated anyone? Is the hostage injured? Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that. Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying to limit the force here. I'm coming in. I'm not armed. I know how you feel, Ray. I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay. Let me show you something, Ray. Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why? Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her. Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything. Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job. I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work. Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count. My name's Scott Roper. NOOOO!! WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? Do you think because the police department issued you a sniper rifle, it makes you God! What the fuck goes on in your head?  You think I've never had a gun pulled on me?! You think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it?!  Not the ones I'm at. Come on. Let's go for a drink. You have to. It's a tradition. You got a girlfriend? Better than your pool game. You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you? You living together? Explain how that works. She grow up in Livingtston, too? Oh, ""city girl"". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey? Every couple of months, huh? That's a lot of commitment. I admire that. No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it. Where did you hear that? Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage. Lesson two, ""Dead Eye""... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage. Yeah, you think so, but it comes up. Zack, another round. My partner gave himself in exchange for a ten year old girl. He got caught in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner and the bad guy...  Weird thing is, if he was alive, he'd probably do it again.  Some people never learn. You think you can learn, McCall? What did you think? I'm going to let you practice on real people? First things is, don't say, ""What's going on?"" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, (addressing the mannequin) ""I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you.""  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that? It'll come. Try again. How are you going to help me? I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts. Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit. Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it. You could say something like,  ""Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."" If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie. Get good at it. You know the ten commandments? What's the first commandment? Okay, forget that. What's the main one. Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right? Why? So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives? Let's try it again. Okay, stop. Close your eyes. What did you see? Very good. You've got good eyes. That's important.  Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side... You know why I like the track? Because there are a multitude of possibility's. Everything is there to see if you know what to look for. You have to read the conditions, just like in a hostage situation. See the four horse. Dropping in class. No works. Front wraps. Looks like he's broken down. But notice the woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. She wouldn't have come if her horse was broken down. He's live. We use him. See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think? I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta. I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks. How you doin', Marv? We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second. Ronnie... Yeah, so. So what do you want?... An autograph. Still needs work. Okay, we're in good shape. We're in good shape. That's okay. That's his style. To run late! The favorite's fading. I told you he wasn't going to run today... The four horse has got the lead! He'll be running at the quarter pole. There he goes. Yeah, first and second. Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell. The jockey!  We lost. How much you wanna bet? Yes! That's eight hundred bucks. About six years. My partner took me. Occasionally you lose.  Roper here.  I'm on my way. We gotta go. See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty. What do we got? Any verification on numbers. What have you promised them? Any good points of entry?  My name's Roper. How are you people doing in there?  Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm the guy authorized to give you whatever you want.  That's right, but first I need to come down there to talk to you. Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business. Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible. I'm going to put my hands down, okay. Yep. Is that all? You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay. Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage. I understand you completely.  We're going to have to take this guy out. I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. I believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques.  So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out? There is some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages...  Yet. Okay. Time to give this fucker a call. This fucker's not answering. He's cutting down the visibility. It's Korda.  Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Shit! Where'd that shot come from? Hold your fire! Damnit!  Are these yours?  Come on! I don't know, but I've got to get on there. Pull up alongside. Sorry, go. Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right here. You know Sam Baffert was a friend of mine. He had a wife... and he had a daughter. What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off? Could I kill you then?  Could I kill you then? We do this shit by the book, but you ain't gonna be smiling. I wanted to get this out of the way. As a matter of fact, I do. I was going to catch the last half on TV. You having dinner with Mr. Baseball? That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much? I've been craving that stuff all week. What do you think? What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar. Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up. What would you say if I quit gambling? It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.  Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again. What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?  When? Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner for some wine. He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend. You okay?!  Stay. Shut the fuck up! Get on your radio and get the police here. If you try again to hurt me or anyone I know, I'm going to have you killed. Here's a picture of your cousin Clarence. That gentleman standing over him is the coroner. You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill you! Whata ya got? Can you get a net out here? McCall! McCall! Where are we going? It might have happened no matter who was up there. Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them. That it is. I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it. You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave. You've got to decide that for yourself. I've lost three. One of them was my partner. I think about them every time I go into a situation.  There's a million people in this city with all kinds of twisted shit going on in their heads, and the bitch of this job is that we expect to go out every day and do the impossible -- to somehow control all this craziness... and we can't.  Nobody's faulting you for this, McCall. My advice is you let yourself off the hook. Let's get out of here.  It has a nice ""nose"". That's my favorite.  Why don't you give us a minute. You like this place? I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about. For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff... ...Let me just show you. Tahiti. Oh you thought I was going to ask you... Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to Tahiti first and see if that works out... I assume you're having your usual -- the ""air dried venison"". How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy. When I get old and fat, I'm moving to Europe. Damn, my eyes are tired from reading that movie. Korda escaped. Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's relax. I'm sure he's just going to try to get out of town. Anyway we leave tomorrow. Why don't we do some of that European movie stuff. Use your imagination. Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie. It's better if you stay inside. Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go. Time to get movin'.  Ronnie?  Ronnie, where are you? Time to go.  Ronnie.  She's gone. That son of a bitch. If he...  He's fucking with you, Scott, be cool... keep your head. He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her. That's a chance I gotta take. Frank, this guy is a psychopath and he's got Ronnie. It's the only way I'm going to get close to him. They'll never approve it, you know that. Besides, I involve the department and she's dead. I got one chance with this guy, Frank, alone.  He killed Sam and he'll kill her.  What if it were Mary?  You'd break every fucking rule in the book... wouldn't you? I owe you one, Frank. Good question. Korda!  Where the hell are you, McCall? Shit.  Where are you? Where is she, Korda? I want to see her. I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me. Satisfied? It's all there. Only the jewels, Korda, you've got my word.  Right there, the one in front... yeah, that one. Toss it. Yeah. I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it. I've kept my end. Ronnie first. Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you out of this. McCall, stop him, stop the car! McCall! McCall, shoot the son of a bitch! It's all over, babe, it's all over. Stay here, don't move. Do it! McCall, you all right? Stay put.  Give it up, Korda, you got away with nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit! It's all fake!  Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it! It's all shit! A hundred dollars worth of glass! Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.  I'll have another Pena Colada. And this time could you shave the ice, please. Hmm? Hmm?  Yeah.  A deeper level?  Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality. I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'. I'm talking about... What are you talking about? You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the ""M"" word. You crazy? With all those people around? The hell I am! First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way."
willow,WILLOW ,Warwick Davis," I can't run off and play with you now.  I've got work to do. Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't know where it's been.  It could be diseased. No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini... Mims!  Get back here!  It might bite you. Absolutely not. Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect -- that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon, keep this thing hidden... In the forest.  My family's been gathering them since last fall. There's no law against that, Bur- glekutt. Absolutely, under no condition, is anyone in this family going to fall in love with that baby. Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby. Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be ignored! This is bad.  If we're caught with that little daikini it'll be the end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need that for the festival.  Kiaya, what are we going to do? Burglekutt's right.  There's not enough time to finish plowing. We'll lose everything and I'll end up working in the mines. No, no!  They'll think it's a bad omen.  There'll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody'll blame me for it! I don't know.  This is trouble. I'll talk to the High Aldwin about it tomorrow at the Festival. And now!  For our final amazing bit of magic, I will make an entire pig completely disappear! Meegosh, I'm in trouble. Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces. That's the last thing I'd ever do.  I gotta get my crop planted.  Meegosh, can you watch the chil- dren?  I gotta talk to the High Aldwin. Sir!  I have to talk to you. It's a matter of great importance to me! Kiaya!  Kiaya! We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We must take her to the Council.  My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin. They'll kill her!  We can't let this baby die! I can't do it!  I haven't put my crop in! Yes. I will, Mims.  Goodnight. Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.  What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep... If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this? I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!  Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad! You cut your hair, Kiaya? I hate this.  Where am I?  I should stick you in a tree and go back home.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that. That's it.  The crossroads... I hate this. I hate this. I really hate this. I will--I'll getcha water--getcha lotsa water--anything you say--! I'm not coming near you! Good.  How long will it take? You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that. Do any other daikinis ever come by here? I have to give this baby to some- body. No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a reason.  I'll wait for somebody else. Hey!  Somebody's coming! Are you okay? I don't know. Don't call me a Peck.  My name is Willow. Farmer. Nooo, I don't think I should. You all right? See if this helps. What's inside? Stop!  Wait! Are you a warrior? What's that?  I hear something! What is it? Sir?  Sir! Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We found her in our village.  Will you take her...? Friend of yours? I hate this. You don't know anything about ba- bies. You gotta promise to feed her. Fresh goat's milk. And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed. Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that. Bye.  Please take good care of her. Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's come home!  Welcome back, Willow! He deserves a medal:  he's quite mystical.  For honor, for bravery, for his intuitive powers...  ...let's make him Apprentice Aldwin.  Better still:  High Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf- good, High Aldwin of--- Come back here, you!  That's my baby!! Oh no, it's a trap! Oh noooooo!!  Where am I?  Where's the baby? That baby's my responsibility! Yeow!  Madmartigan...I never should've trusted you... Who are you? Queen Cherlindrea? Who?? Why?? I'm getting her out of there! I can't go out there with the baby! Ohhh, I hate this. Why not? Trolls? This is not going well.  Yes...? I can't see anything--she's too bright! You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? What a relief.  Now I can go home. Me? What is Tir Asleen? Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is it? You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody. No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!  Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers. They look like acorns. They're magic?  Are you serious? But I've got a family to think about!  They need me! Hello...? I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do it! But I only have one shoe. Wait till I tell my children. Stuff like this never happens in my village. How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin. Daikinis... Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't cry, Elora.  Things can't get any worse than this... Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What could possibly happen? Could you spare some milk for this poor hungry baby? I could use your help, boys. This is not fun. Woah! You!! I trusted you... Hey!  Give me that baby! Nursemaid?!  Time to change her diaper. No!  You can't! Because she's sick. Madmartigan!  Wait! We could've been killed, Madmarti- gan! Heeyah!  Heeyah! Oh no! Woah...woah...! Where's the baby?? Elora Danan! Madmartigan!  You saved her life! Let's get out of here before they come back. Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me. Madmartigan, I need your help. But you're a great swordsman!  You're not a warrior, Madmartigan! A warrior wouldn't lie there and do nothing! We're in trouble!  You've seen the big army that's after us!  You're a fake!  You're a bum!  You're a-- you're a coward!! I miss my wife!  I miss my chil- dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing up so fast, he even helps me on the farm now!  And little Mims!  If you ever saw her sweet little face you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd *melt*!  Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't know anything about love.  You don't know anything about any- thing... You? Madmartigan!  Madmartigan! How are we going to get out there? We need to get out to that island. We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel. What would the Fairy Queen say? Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go. Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel? I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel. This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal. We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess. Madmartigan! Help, Madmartigan!  The oar! No! I can't go on... No. I'll help you...! That's all I ever wanted! If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying. What do I need for that? I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?  I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it? The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan. I'm all finished.  Now what? How am I gonna do that? What's going on? She needs to be changed. She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.  Madmartigan. I don't know much about him. Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair. She's hungry. Here.  Hold her. Sometimes she likes it heated. She's a good baby. I did it!  I got the ashes! Who? She said lots of thing.s She asked about you, Madmartigan. You're crazy.  I think you're in love. I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality! The limitless power of...  I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?  But what am I gonna transform?? You? I'll do it, Raziel... Oooh, this smells terrible. Ouch!! What'd you bit me for!! His will. I just wanted to test it first. Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha... What did I do? Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get Eloran Danan.  Come on, Madmartigan...! What are you doing?  Get out of there...! Nooo!!! The princess, Elora Danan. We're taking her to Tir Asleen. She'll be safe there from Bavmorda's powers. Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places. I'm used to her.  How's she doing? She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress. That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and-- Ahhh! I hate this. There's nobody here. How?? Beings within, beings without! Danu danu walkail funfawtha! I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it! Tuatha tuatha danu! Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician! I feel like I could do anything! Capture the enery...limitless power of the will...avvdachh doth indicht rredd baerkinhaekin! Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What happened? I'm sorry.  There were too many of them. Why? I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die! She's too powerful, Raziel Banish all disturbing forces from this place.  Fire, water, above and below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal- ance. Raziel! Wait!! I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs. I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle... Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her? Me, too. Surrender!! We are all-powerful magicians! Give us the baby or we will destroy you!! Courage, Willow. I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician. I'm a *great* magician. No.  You can't have her. And with my magic I'll send her into the...into the... Into the good. It was just the old disappearing pig trick. Your dream has come true, madmarti- gan. Farewell, Elora Danan. Kiaya!!"
paul,CLIVE ,Nick Frost," Beautiful piece. How much? No, it's rubbish. Do you feel that the killing of Hicks and Newt in Alien 3, invalidates Ripley's struggle at the closed of the previous installment? Clive. Uh... are you... did you? I... I need to photograph him. Really? I wasn't. Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I forgot to give him my card. CLIVE points at SECURITY. Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here! Yes, it's very impressive. That was Graham's idea. I'll have a fat Coke please? Coke. A what? Yes please. Why is it so quiet? Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I wanted to find out if he actually eats the brains. Please. Don't be. The hard work's done, we have a great story and as usual your renderings jump from the page. All we have to do now is sit back and enjoy. A child approaches. Queen Jelva welcomes thee. Main pavillion. Three copies. Yeah, but three copies? Graham, I need a drink. It was like the Prancing Pony in there. They think they're so cool. Hell yes. A-ffirmative. GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches. Three, two, one... Good night, Graham. No. Couldn't hurt could it? We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV. The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers. Cover me. No, that's ours. A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of the range in its day. Still looks good. Java. Straight up. No, let's punch through. Miles make the eggs taste sweeter. I hear that. Now, get that ""Joe' on the go and jump in the Chewie seat. I need your map skills. Yeah, I could say ""take the helm."" Yeah, ""take the helm, number one, I need a number two."" They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out his laptop and setting it up on the dash board. Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi map and advanced geo-tagging with continual info stream? Most impressive. Not when we're driving Graham. Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've had my first cup of J. GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen. Amazing, isn't it? There are 295,734,134 people in this country and we haven't seen a soul for a hundred miles. Where is everybody? Apart from her. I suppose that's why they established the Dreamland facility out here. Did you know the site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane, due to its remoteness, proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bad for landings? Oh. Before. How could you tell? We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever. Encounter Briefs? I've got all six. Do you get a lot of UFO types round here? We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face. And objects. Did you now, it's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts, around which orbit countless planets and moons? Oh. What? I'd like a cup of coffee please. It's nice here, isn't it? I think I might use the loo. CLIVE walks through a door marked ""Maliens'. The adjacent toilet door  enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy. That is absolutely amazing! Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up into my palms. CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement. I'm joking, of course. They have a soap dispenser, shaped like an alien's head. When you pump his jaw, soap comes out of his mouth. It's hilarious. GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter. What? CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back. CLIVE immediately loses his confident air. What took you so long? They were an odd pair, weren't they? No. Nothing. How we doing? I've found it. It's amazing, isn't it? We're actually here. Dreamland. MacArthur's Black Mile. No, I made it up myself. Be great if we saw something. That would be incredible. It just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast. Whoosh. Keep it together. First contact is a big responsibility. They come in peace, we go to pieces? That's not how I roll. CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed. What's wrong? GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS. Who? Who's found us? Run for it Marty! GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV. Of course it's them. We're dead. It's like Deliverance. They're going to rape us and break our arms. There's only one thing for it. I'm gonna have to fly blind. Probably best not to do that. I couldn't really see anything. They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible. Oh God, oh God, oh God. Me too. The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake. They're trying to overtake. Should I ram them? It wasn't them. The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out of the window. We should see if they're okay. I can hold mine. GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears. Hello? They wait for a few seconds. Nothing. I rather think these men need help. Graham, give me the phone. GRAHAM passes the phone over. I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL MAD, Graham. If that is your name? You're happily sitting there chatting to... to... that, like it's the most natural thing in the world. The two of you laughing away like you haven't seen each other since 1990. PAUL spits a shell out into a cup. So forgive me if I seem a little rattled but from where I'm standing it would appear you are trading nut knowledge with an alien life form. Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul Reiser? No he is not! How could he possibly have travelled that distance? Balls! Graham, this isn't what it seems. What about Ocham's Razor? Yes, the old man who owns it told me that, in unbelievable circumstances, the most plausible explanation is usually the truth. That you're a thin midget in an alien costume. Oh really? With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin, trying to gain a hold of a mask. You're not real. You're not real! Oh shit! CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder. Where's he gone? As if. We would have seen the classic shimmer and hum. Britain. We were having a little drive. He was a good egg. Thank you. May I ask what you're searching for? Well, it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it? Yes, the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox, which was white by the way, and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien. I mean, it's what we've always wanted, isn't it? Than that's what happened. PAUL materializes from thin air behind them. Where the hell did you go? No thank you. Graham, there is a Grey in the galley, making me coffee. No, I don't want tea. No, what's wried, Graham, is that we have picked up an extra terrestrial hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it! Why us? What about the RV? It has to be back in two days. I suppose we could phone the hire company and get an extension. PAUL looks super-pleased. How did you get here? Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?! They invented a fake alien crash to distract from an actual alien crash? What have you been doing here all this time? No thanks. Go on then, I'll have half. Jam. Jelly. Thank you. So, do you know where we're going? Why can't he tell us? Do you trust him, Graham? I mean, is he Strider or Black Rider? You'd better be right. I don't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus. There's a place called Ely five miles from here. It's small but there should be a gas station. Paul, don't do that! You know this is a gas station? PAUL looks disappointed. Ready? Thanks. Don't you think that's a bit much? Put it all back. Except the burrito... and the doughnuts... and the chocolate milk. Let's just pay for it and leave. Essential only, Graham! They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER. Thank you very much, officer. It's find for you. You'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay. PAUL laughs. Why's everything so funny? They think we're Muslims. Paul, the authorities know we're in an TV. Ah yes, the waspish markings of a Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable. Nothing anyone could've done. PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands. Why would you do that? Mummy, I am bushed. Best case, I'd like a cold flannel on my neck and an honest meal. Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck with an RV park? We need somewhere off the beaten track, n'est pas? You read my mind. GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE. Can I help you? No, thank you. I don't smoke. PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face. Could you unwrap it for me? What? No! What are you trying to say? Great find, Graham. Just the way we like it. PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on the horn. Stop doing that!  We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest. I was talking to you. Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come in? Yes. London. Have you been? You don't have a passport? RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare. Doors to manual and cross check. Graham? Graham? I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's my forte. CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and slams the door of the RV behind him. I am actually, yes. Really? All the good ones die. So you've been here for 60 years? Why did you come to earth? What?! Mulder was right! Would you like a go? PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the Hendrix face. They laugh loudly. Who is it? Good morning. Yes, thank you. The other one? Oh the other one. Um... I suppose we're men of science. If we believe in anything it would be macro evolution. Cause and effect. The establishment of a biological order from the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos. RUTH looks scandalized. Did you know that the universe has been dated as being 13.5 billion years old an that the release of neutral hydrogen at the moment of the big bang has enabled scientists to do this with categorical accuracy? Not you! What did you do that for? She saw you! The authorities will be on the look out for exactly this sort of thing. Paul, right now they're going to follow any lead they can get. How am I going to get my passport back? PAUL vanishes. I can't drive like this. We'll have to drop her off and take our chances. Oh great! Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me. He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable. No spoilers! PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert. Is that where we're going? Someone should go after her. Graham? CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone. Graham!? Small corrections! Small corrections! RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep. I'm hungry. Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I happen to be very strong. PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits it onto the floor of the RV. So childish. I did it! Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk to anyone unless you have to and try to look inconspicuous. Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America. I wish he'd stop doing that! They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, dented. We'll order food and wait for you at the bar. Be careful. RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders. We're still waiting on a wet fries. The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry. Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps we can exchange insurance details?  He said, leave her alone. At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and comes face to face with her father. Graham? Graham, take Ruth into the RV and lock the door. I don't want either of you to see this. CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in the face, he falls, nose bleeding. They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL stands silhouetted against the interior lights. Who? Who are you talking about? He was so angry. I'm game. What about when I got smacked in the nose? Thank you. He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers. Let's party! Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or something? Paul Simon. I can speak Klingon. Hey! Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa. Calm down, Rog. More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint. She called her dog Paul? It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily in this situation Graham and I would be looking up at the stars, wondering about life on other planets but we know now, don't we? It's a bit of an anti-climax. I don't mean that in a bad way. They all scratch their noses. How so? Stool? I don't follow. I thought the crash was our fault. Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick. She was an Ewok! Sniff. She was a midget. I know. I'm sorry. How did that happen? Oh, thank God. For a second there I thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer. The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood. Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet town of last night has become very busy indeed. How are we going to get back? Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life. You could be a midget. I must have it. Oh, come on, we've got time. Who was that? $299.99. It's made of a low grade Turkish alloy. What are you going to do with this? Us? What shall we say if it's her? We're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago? Knock again. Tara Walton? Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive Gollings and this is my friend and colleague, Graham Willy. We're from England and we're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago. Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to reveal a woman . Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE. It's no joke. PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE. Yes? I'll drive! I think we have a problem. What? They're trying to overtake. Shall I ram him? What are we doing exactly? Are you sure you know what you're doing?! Paul! Where did it go? They're still coming! They're gaining! Great Caesar's ghost! We've lost them. TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back. GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away. I only saw one car following us. Oh no. Fare thee well friend. You were a faithful and mighty steed. He's not going anywhere. Blind fury. The blade falls off. Bloody low grade Turkish alloy. He's not a goblin he's from another planet. You can keep it. You are, and always will be, our friend. Oh, say hi from us, won't you? RUTH kisses GRAHAM. Two nerds approach."
mud,ELLIS ,Tye Sheridan," I'm comin' out now. Suck it. Drive. The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail. A Junior. Nah. I know. I'm not worried about my dad killin' us. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them. It's enormous. Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river by comparison. The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown water and yellow foam six football fields wide. It ain't gonna sink. We gotta move if we're gonna make it back. Set your watch. We'll need a good fifteen minutes. Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch. They take their seats. Ellis cranks the motor. The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river. Yeah, there it is. A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above. It came down from up there. Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off. Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head over. He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood. Who else knows about this? What's he think? Good. Ellis walks to the cabin. He pushes a vinyl door open. 'Cause this boat's ours. Ellis has to duck down to go inside. Neckbone follows. This is perfect. Neck. Neck. Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's FRESH. Ellis freezes. Someone's here. Someone's livin' here. Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence. We gotta go. I can't be late. Hold it. Up there. They stop. Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print. They appear to vanish. I don't know. Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their boat. Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He flinches at the sight of the Man. MUD stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back at them and casts his fishing line into the water. I've never seen him before. What's that? Mud takes the cigarette from his mouth. A tattoo of a snake's head covers the top of his right hand. Two large cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws. You talkin' 'bout our boat? No. They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and spits on it. Then, tucking the pole under his arm, he ties a lock of his hair into a knot. He finishes this process with another cast. You got crosses in your heels. What for? DeWitt. Neckbone looks at Ellis, frustrated by his friend. We s'posed to know you? Where around here? You know Shelly's Oxbow? Neckbone can't believe his friend is offering this up. He still does. His boat's cross from mine. Mud smiles. A deal for what? Why don't you go get your own food? When they show up, you'll leave? Mud begins fishing again. And when you leave, that boat's ours? We gotta go. With that, Ellis turns to leave. The boys walk briskly back to their boat. Ellis looks over his shoulder to see Mud making another cast with his fishing pole. You get his name?! I'm sorry. Neck and I got caught up helpin' Galen. I know, I'm sorry. Yessir. Senior flips up the tailgate. Ellis hops up the wheel well and into the bed of the truck. He steadies himself on one of the coolers as his father pulls away. It's s'posed to be ten. You drop me at Neck's? Senior checks his pants pockets, feels around under his seat. Said he had something for me. What'd Momma wanna talk to you about? This mornin', what'd she wanna talk with you about? I wasn't spyin', just heard ya'll. I came by for that book. You said Galen had a book might help me out. Yeah. You know who it is? You tell Galen 'bout this morning? No. Maybe. I don't know. I think he just needed some help. I think I'm gonna go back, take him some food. Thanks. Ellis flips delicately through the manual. I think it's the right thing to do. All right. Neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer. Ellis flips through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park. You okay momma? I'm all right. Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the sink. She turns to Ellis. Okay momma. Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom. The door closes and Ellis is left alone in the den. It's quiet. He waits, looking at the door his mother just closed. Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door. Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and fills it with CANNED FOOD. What do you know about Tom Blankenship? Mr. Blankenship, what do you know about him? I don't know. He looks lonely over there. Yes ma'am. She walks off the boat without a glance in Senior's direction. He trails her with his eyes before going back to digging in the ice. A29 Ellis looks back at Tom. The Walkie SQUAWKS out several A29 loud BEEPS. Ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the boat. Bye Dad. Senior holds a hand up but never looks up from his work. I guess we should try the boat. They head for the treeline. Looks like he made camp. What're you doin'? Mud bounds down, stepping from limb to trunk to the ground. It's an agile move. I brought you some food. Mud looks at the backpack, but doesn't move. Go on. Yeah. Who's this guy you're waitin' on? What happens if you get bit again? We gotta go help Neck's uncle. You never said your name. Mud? I don't care about that. Ellis watches as the same Skinny Kid from before tries to flirt with her. She's not having it. He pops her bra strap before landing the final straw, a smack on her ass. She turns and swats at him. Seeing this, Ellis is on his feet and crossing the street. Hey. Ellis taps the Kid on the shoulder. As he turns, Ellis PUNCHES him in the face. The Kid, completely taken off guard, stumbles and trips to the ground. Some older, tougher looking GUYS see this and begin laughing at him. He was messin' with you. I'm Ellis. That's Neck. Neckbone waves by wagging a finger in the air. We went to Junior High with you, before you went to High School. Fourteen. So? I know. Nothin'. She smiles. What? No. Did you see her hands? Sorry. We know a guy we think might know that girl. I guess I'll see you. I can find it. May Pearl walks over to her friend. Ellis watches her go, but then remembers Juniper. He turns to Neckbone. Where'd she go? I'm gonna go see if it's her. Wants me to call her. It's her. I saw the tattoos. He wasn't lyin'. What you hidin' for? Yessir. I know. Yessir. What's that mean? What's that mean for me? But you and me can still live out here. Game and fish can't take your boat. Not while you're still in it. But that ain't right. You work outta here. We got the ice machine, the traps. What are we supposed to do? I ain't no townie. I ain't livin' like that. Senior takes a slow pull off the bottle. Ellis' mind races. But ya'll are married. Ya'll are s'posed to love each other. I got you some Beanie Weenie. Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack. That's all my mom had. Can I get one of those? I missed my dinner. The girl you're waitin' on, she's your girlfriend? How'd you meet her? Do you love her? From the snake bite. Why aren't ya'll married? My dad says my parents may be gettin' a divorce. If it happens, and my mom moves us off the river, they say the government can come take our boat away. Everybody. They passed a law so you can't sell your boat. Can't rent it. If the owner leaves, they got you. Game and Fish want `em off the river. I saw Juniper today. I didn't talk to her, but she had the birds tattooed on her hand like you said. You were right. She's pretty. Mud stands, surprised by the news. He walks to the other side of the fire so his back is to the boy. At the Piggly Wiggly. I think she's stayin' at a motel by there. The Executive Inn. Mud looks at Ellis through the fire. He takes a drag and smiles at the boy. The hole from his missing tooth shows. Does she know you're out here? You wanna go tonight? I can give you a ride up river. Mud looks at Ellis, nodding. You need me to come get you? It's Saturday. What do you wanna talk about? You want to leave and that means they can tear up our house. No. What'd he do?! The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis.  Neck! Neck, pick up! My mom and I were headed to Wal- Mart on 165. There was a roadblock with state troopers. They searched our car and showed us a picture of Mud. They're lookin' for him. No. No. That's why I called you. We gotta warn him. He's goin' to get Juniper today. I went out there last night and told him where we saw her. He needs to know people are lookin' for him. He loves her Neck. He told me. He's not dangerous. Reluctantly, Neckbone throws his leg into the boat. He may already be gone. What are you doin'? So you know about the state troopers? He looks up from his notebook. Why? I need to hear about it. Mud sits up. He looks at Ellis, deciding how much to tell. Where were you? You did it for her? To protect her? Tom Blankenship? Mud has smoked down to the filter. He crushes the butt into his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket. I know where he lives, but I've never spoke to him. You comin'? What? I ain't huntin you. I came to find you. I got a message for you. Yessir. It ain't from him. Ellis, not wanting to follow further, shouts from the planks. Yessir. He asked me to come get you. Tom straightens his back. He looks into the woods, searching for something he may have missed. No sir. Mud needs your help. Tom's mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy. There he is. Tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward Mud. Ellis and Neckbone stay by the boat and watch. I don't know. You all right? Mud raises his head. Yeah. I can handle it. Ellis steps forward and Mud hands over the note. Ellis takes it and walks back to the others. What do you think? I told him I would. Neckbone thinks about this seriously, shakes his head. You still got that trailer you made for your bike? I say we start at the top, work our way down. We're sellin' fish. You wanna buy some? I don't...I... Yeah. Mud sent us to give this to you. Juniper is stunned. She looks at the bag, then at the boys. I think it's a couple days. He wants to get a boat for ya'll. We won't. We'll be all right. Keep your door locked. We'll be in touch. Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler. I'm Ellis. That's Neckbone. Lock the door. She smiles. The door slams shut. The room number, 212, stares Ellis in the face. He takes a deep breath. Hello? Is May Pearl there?...This is Ellis...Hey, it's Ellis. Hey... What?...In the phone book... from his car commercials...I think they're all right...Tomorrow? Yeah, I can meet you... Okay. Bye. Ellis hangs up the phone. With the peas pressed firmly against his face, he smirks. Yeah. Ellis turns and Mud sees his black eye for the first time. We came up on Juniper's room. A guy was in there beatin' up on her. Mud's face turns dark. I don't know. Tall. Looked like a cowboy. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not stupid. Ellis takes the pulley and scales the trunk without hesitation. Mud tosses his pocket knife to Neckbone. What'd you mean when you called Tom an assassin? Thanks. You make up your mind? About leavin' dad. Mary Lee thinks about how to answer, shuts off the radio. Not really. Ellis takes a sip from the Sonic cup. His face puckers. I guess. You got a lot of friends. I bet you're pretty popular. I don't know. `Cause you're nice to people. You're nice to me. I got this for you. He removes a bracelet made from the pearls he collected off Galen's porch. May Pearl takes it, begins putting it on. Neckbone's uncle caught the pearls. I thought with your name and everything... You wanna be my girlfriend? She smiles, then kisses him. I don't drink coffee. Ellis waits for a moment, but realizes this is Tom's way of inviting him inside. He enters. No. He's okay. He called you an assassin. Tom snorts out a laugh, sips his coffee. Is it true? Few days. So it's not true. Yeah I guess. Tom notices the boy's disappointment. I don't know. Yeah. Because he hurt Juniper. I gotta go. Ellis heads for the door, but stops short. You're wrong about Juniper. They love each other and they're gonna make it. If you weren't a wore out old man you'd know it was true. Tom eyes the boy, taking a sip from his cup. He nods a goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door. I got more stuff. Not yet.  What's that? Why? Helpin' his uncle with a dive. Tom called me over to his place this mornin'. He was runnin' down Juniper. Ellis looks for a response, but Mud just jumps up into the boat and starts throwing pieces of wood on shore. I told him he was a wore out old man. Told him he couldn't know how much you loved Juniper. I don't care. I gotta go help my dad. Mud turns back but doesn't stop moving. A kid in town. He got his too. `Bout a girl. My girlfriend. Yes sir. Other day. Senior pats his shirt pocket and finds a smoke. Lights it. No. I'm talkin'. I'm talkin' to both of you. That's all ya'll want to do is talk. A little. Thanks. Ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer. We could take it apart. Bring it out piece by piece. With what? Yeah. I think so. What? I don't know. No. We still need a motor. It's true. He built his own dirt bike. I don't know. That motor's worth somethin'. It's not like this other junk. I wanna talk to room 212. Juniper? It's me. Yeah. It's time to take you out to him. Tomorrow. We'll come get you. He's got a plan for ya'll to get away. Be ready tomorrow at five. Neckbone'll be waitin' at the back of the motel with a dirt bike. I'll take care of that. Just be ready at five. It's okay. He's got the boat. We helped him fix it up. It's a good plan. Just be ready. What do you mean? Cause ya'll love each other. Juniper searches for a comment. Ellis, looking out over the parking lot, sees May Pearl getting out of a car with her MOTHER and SISTER. I'll see you tomorrow. We're good. We don't want your money. Carver steps in close to the boys. No. Carver removes a flier with Mud's picture and holds it out. I'm sure. No. Carver smiles. He tucks the flier and the forty dollars into Ellis' hand. I don't know. Take your bike around the side. I'll check her room. We'll just have to hope no one sees us. Neckbone cranks the bike and speeds toward the motel. Ellis looks to the motel, then the parking lot. Nothin'. Ellis notices the front office Come on. Scuse me, sir? We're lookin' for the girl in room 212. You seen her? You see her today. It's gotta be. We're gonna have to tell Mud. Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly. Just leave it. Mud'll have to help get it. I'll just tell him the truth. We got that motor. Yeah. She didn't meet up with us. It wasn't Carver. Mud straightens up, prepares for the news. She was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel. She never showed up. We went asking for her. The motel clerk told us she went to a bar out on 61. We tracked her down. She was there with another guy. She knew the plan Mud. She just didn't show up. They were playin' pool. Drinkin'. He was close up on her. They were laughin'. He kissed her on the neck. Mud nods. What do you want us to do? Tom left this for you. They slowly retreat into the woods and disappear. Mud turns back to the campfire and shoves the pot into the ashes. His eyes, soft and red, reflect the flame. You think it's all right to leave him alone?! Hello? Is May Pearl there...This is Ellis...I called yesterday, you give her my message?...My name is Ellis. I'm her boyfriend...Oh, she's asleep...I said she's asleep? The front door flies open. Senior storms headlong toward Ellis. He shouts. I don't know what you're sayin'. We didn't steal it. We thought it was junk. We didn't think it was worth anything. I'm not a thief. Stop it dad. I can't take that motor back. But I'll pay him for it. I'll pay him what he wants for it. Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy. It's a bonfire. He had something else on his mind. Come on. Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline. We found your shirt. Ellis tosses it to him. Mud tosses it back. We saw what's left of your bonfire. You do some drinkin' last night? Okay Mud. Ellis takes the letter. Mud goes back to the boat motor. He motions to Neckbone to join him. You still takin' Juniper? Yeah. What about you? Can I borrow your bike? Neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket. Hesitates.  Hello. I saw the guy you're lookin' for...Yeah, he's crazy lookin'. Saw him at the Wal-mart outside of Gillet. He was buyin' some beanie weenie...'bout five minutes ago. I'm supposed to give this to you. Juniper takes the letter. No. I gotta go. All you had to do was be there. Then why'd you even come here? I know he'd do anything for you. She puts her cigarette out in a Coke can on the floor. What's it say? You get my phone calls? I've been callin' you.  Who's this guy? I called you twice yesterday. Your sister didn't tell you? Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement. From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before. Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to converge on them. Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the pavement. Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him. Another punch to Ellis' face. May Pearl is out of the car and yelling. What? I'm sorry, I just wanted to know why you hadn't called me back. Because you're my girlfriend. The crowd is watching. We kissed. Yeah but... I love you. Don't. Wait. We can make this work. We can figure it out. I love you. What are you doing? Ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in the flames. Stop it! That's mom's stuff! STOP You're a liar. Makin' two kids run around doin' work you're too scared to do yourself. Makin' me tell her it's over `cause you're too scared to do it yourself. Mud steps back and gives the boy his space. Neckbone has made his way over and watches from behind Mud. You said you loved her and you lied. You gave up on her and she gave up on you just like everybody else. I trusted you. Bonfires and crosses. Wolf's eye bullshit. Mud tries to approach him but the boy explodes, shoving him. You made me a thief! Ellis walks back into the woods. Mud exhales and turns back to Neckbone. Where am I? How'd I get to the doctor? No. Senior gently pats her shoulders. Okay. Senior leads Mary Lee to the door. Mom? Dad? They turn back. I love ya'll. Mud? How'd you get here? You did? Good. Me too. I'm sorry `bout what I said. I know. She loves you too. She said it. This fact still strikes Mud. He nods. My dad says you can't count on women lovin' you. He says you can't trust it. You're a good man too Mud. Mud smiles. Mud?! Yeah. You got your bike back. It's the law. No. He's gone. Said he couldn't watch it. He's pickin' me up in a minute. Got deliveries today. They sit in silence as the Workers exit off the houseboat. I don't know. I hope not. The crane begins lifting up the houseboat. The metal wires tighten and the entire structure creaks. A sucking sound as the flotilla separate from the water. The boat hangs, suspended in the air. A HORN HONKS behind the boys. Ellis turns to see Senior's truck. I gotta go. Come by the apartment. Help me set my room up. I'll see you next week? Yessir. Love you too."

We're in a rapid dive here... Negative. We're too high...we can't pitch for glide. We have no stabilizer control. OK! Here's what we're going to do!  When I say, you retract the gear, retract the flaps and trim both ailerons. But every things gonna be opposite, so be sure to trim down. Margaret... When I ask for power, push both of these forward. Got it?  What's your son's name? Say ""I love you Trevor."" The black box. We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control. Just a little barrel roll. Don't panic. Relax. Let it roll. EVANS, FLAPS! MARGARET FULL POWER! EVANS, TRIM US! GEAR UP! Margaret! Can you reach it? WHAT'S OUR ALTITUDE? Let it roll. I got it! We're level. We can maintain altitude like this. Uh, Atlanta...we're inverted. We're flying! PUT IT OUT!  HOW FAR'S THE AIRPORT!?  We're not gonna make that!  There's a field and a road ah...we're gonna put it down in that field. WE'RE COMING BACK OVER! EVANS, WHEN I START THE ROLL, THROW EVERYTHING BACK OUT!  WHAT'S MY ALTITUDE!? We have enough speed to fly! HERE WE GO! FLAPS FULL! GEAR DOWN! MARGARET, POWER!!!!  Are we gliding? WE'RE IN A GLIDE! PITCH FOR GLIDE! TRIM IT! PITCH FOR GLIDE! BRACE! BRACE FOR IMPAC... Charlie Anderson. How many? 4 passengers. Are the rest badly hurt? Who'd we lose on the crew? I remember everything until the crash. Who on the crew died? I knew Trina Marquez. We spent some time together. How's Margaret Thomason? Charlie, why are you here? You're the rep for the pilots' union? I'm glad it's you. Yeah, Knuckles. No, I'll call her. No, I'm okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks Charlie, I really...  It means a lot to me that you came. Charlie, that plane was fucked. Harling...Harling...yeah, it's Whip. I'm in a hospital in South Atlanta...what? You know where I am? Okay well fuck...yeah, I'm okay. What? Well, I'm looking to get outta here...hopefully tomorrow. Yeah. But, listen, I need you to bring me something to wear. Goddamn it... It's okay, Harling. The meds they're giving me are fucking me up -- I'm all shaky and dried out. I can't sleep good. Listen Harling, leave it alone.  So you got my message and decided not to call me back? Did you bring me smokes? Harling... Shut the fuck up, Harling...Six people died. Harling, take the vodka with you. Take the fucking vodka! Look, I'm tired man. You gotta come and get me, tomorrow. Here are my keys. Go to the condo and bring me some nice clothes I can wear, my phone charger and grab the veal outta my fridge. It's marked. Yeah, the veal that's in my freezer. Tomorrow. I'll call you. Thank you. I didn't think anyone would have the same devious thought about using the fire stairs to have a smoke... Don't go. I'll be quiet. We don't have to talk. Be nice to just smoke with someone. Yeah, I was. Were you? Up near the front. Yeah, I'm lucky. Goin' home tomorrow. You're living here? What kind of cancer? God chose you? You believe in God? I don't know her. Here's a pack. Yeah? Your mom had cancer. But why'd that guy ask you if you were gonna die? Is that right? Well, where should we live? If we're gonna save the world, where should we do that? What? You don't want me either. Where do you live? The luxurious bus station? I'll come visit you. I will. What's your address? Georgian Gardens? How long are you staying here? Oh. Okay. And you're a masseuse? What kind of masseuse? Good luck Nicole. Thanks Mike. No. I'm gonna go to the farm. My dad's place. I can't stay at my condo. Not yet. You're not. Just take me to the airport to get my car. God landed the plane? I'm good with coffee. They find the flight data recorders? Great. That solves everything. The recorders will tell the story. Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago? Criminal negligence? The plane fell apart at 30 thousand feet. I had to fly that plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh. Do you get the picture? 100 passengers hanging upside down, 500 feet off the ground. Do you have any idea what that sounds like? Are you a pilot? Then you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Charlie, what do I need to know? I'm already tired of this guy. When did they do that? Do they have the results of these blood tests? Did I just see warm cinnamon rolls come out? Bring me one wouldya? Actually bring me two, okay sweetie? What does that mean? I had a beer the night before I flew. And what...That made the tail of the plane explode? I need a lawyer. I need a bigger lawyer. A lawyer who understands that I flew a broken plane and without me at that stick there'd be 102 funerals, not To write checks, well it's not me I promise you that. And as long as they're writing checks, write me one because someone put me in a broken plane. I'd love a check. I'm not worried, Charlie. I promise you that. No one could have landed that plane like I did, no one.  When I ask for power, push both of these forward. Got it? What's your son's name? Can I get an orange juice? Say ""I love you Trevor."" The black box. And a double shot of Stoli.  Taylor street, Taylor st...ah, here we are. The fuck are you doin'!? Keep your fucking hands off her! You okay?  Is this all the stuff you want from here? Okay, start taking that stuff down. You wanna spend a thousand bucks suing her and get jack shit? Or do you want to make a cash deal with me? You're a creep...with your baseball bat bullshit...  I'll give you 400 in cash. Good boy. Now help her get that box in her car. Your car doesn't run? What were you gonna do?  Then put the fucking box in my car. Whip. You okay? Okay. Yea. I want you to stay. That feels better. C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside. You just decided to drop by? I turned it off. Okay, gimme a minute. Wait here. The left wing partially pulled away- I drank a lot the night before that flight. I drank that morning too and I used coke to straighten up. But that's not the reason this happened. Why'd you bring me here? You trying to scare me? Who's God would do this? I'll stop. I can stop.  I told you I can stop. I won't drink. Get up! What? You can't get up?!  C'mon, Knuckles Whitaker drags himself up and goes long...go. Touchdown Whitaker! Atta boy! C'mon back. What? Come back and do it again. Tired? Junior, you don't know tired. I'm not going out. You go out. Keep running. Don't, don't, don't! I'll get him. Knuckles, junior. See him. Yeah. I'm not calling again. Fuck him. He didn't call. Not back. Not calling back. Morning. Tired. Guess I drank a bit. You wanna count the fuckin' beers? They're still in the garbage. Vodka too, is that okay with you? Good. Lemme see that camera. It was my grandfather's farm, my dad grew up here. He was a pilot in World War II, flew with the 332nd. See the landing strip out there? He built that. He ran a crop duster outta here until the EPA put an end to that.  He traded the crop duster for a used Cessna. He flew that damn thing all over. It's still in the barn. I was gonna sell this place after my dad died. Then I got divorced... Dead...she's dead. Your dad still alive? You got no relationship with him. You too Margaret. Broken collar bone? I didn't go in. I couldn't. No. I can't, really. I will, but just not now. Yeah...y'know...I'm in the middle of this investigation. The NTSB is investigating the crash- I'm nervous because I was out the night before the crash at dinner- Yeah and I had two glasses of wine. And they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought I had anything to drink. What? You have to tell them it was an ordinary day. I mean it was an ordinary day. You know I was in shape to fly. You have a problem with saying that? My lack of sleep made the plane fall apart, huh Margaret? I'm just trying to get it straight. You think that another pilot would have been able to land that plane and save more lives? Well can you imagine Trevor at this same church looking at you in that box in there? Or my son having to come and see me in prison? It was an ordinary day. The storm right after we took off was very severe, but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day. It was okay, okay. How're you doin'? That's good. Cause for a celebration.  He did. So should we get some dinner? No, it's okay. You should go. Open meeting? Even me? I gotta go. Okay?  Can uh... How're you feeling, Ken? I'm Captain Whitaker, I was flying- Listen, how long have you been... I didn't mean to disrupt your whole day. I know they been swamping you with interviews. You were great on CNN... I'm sorry Ken. I don't know how much you remember, but the plane started to fall apart. What are we talking about? I just wanted to get a sense from you what you thought caused the crash. You think you'd be alive without me on that plane? I'm not gonna argue anything with you. Praise Jesus. Looks great right? It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's. He kept it perfect. Yeah, he flew this plane a few months before he died. I learned to fly in this plane. You can land it anywhere. My friend Harling and I flew it to Jamaica. We set off for an overnight fishing trip two hours south of here. We ended up in Bethel, Jamaica. It was like a picture on a post card. The white sand and sky blue water. Most beautiful place I've ever been. Yeah, really warm. Let's go. Let's go tomorrow. We'll leave in the morning...we'll just go. Start over. It's a beautiful beach, it's paradise.  I'm fine thanks. You go to a couple of AA meetings and all of a sudden you think you're Jesus Christ? Worry about yourself. WE'RE NOT- I didn't suck dick to get high. And don't give me a whole... Your mom died and dad drank and bullshit, bullshit, bullshit -- Is that why you shot dope? Well there's a lot of people out there who lost their mom who've never had a drink in their life. I choose to drink. I choose to drink! And I blame it on me. I'm happy to. I've got an ex-wife and a son I don't see. Why? Because I choose to drink! Alright look, I was loaded when I crashed that plane. With this investigation going on, I don't know what's gonna happen. Come to Jamaica with me. Come with me. I need help, I do. When we get to Jamaica we can go to the local hospital. I'll do it for you. Anything you want. I'll be sober. I won't force you to stay. I promise if you don't like it or if I don't clean up? You can leave. It's so beautiful there. We'll leave before noon. I'm a great pilot. You'll get to see so much. Yeah, I'm here. What's goin' on? Look, it's simple. I flew a broken plane. And what about my toxicology report? Okay. I see...where this is going. That's funny that they found two bottles. Because I drank three. One's missing. Fuck you too, Hugh. Can I go now? Yeah. So? Great. I'm going home. What fucking life?! Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh.  You wanna talk about me like I'm not here? Like I'm fucking dead? Yeah Charlie just get him home. Sober him up long enough to save the union's contract and that fat fuck's airline. Fuck you. I shoulda died on that plane. It's lovely to see you too Deana. May I come in? Thought I`d come see you and Will.  KNUCKLES! YOU HERE?  We haven't talked at all since this whole thing happened and I just thought we should talk. Call you? Like anyone in this house has called me in the last three years to say anything other than ""Where's the money?"" Well that took...what? 17 seconds?  It took 17 seconds for you-  LADIES and GENTLEMEN it took EXACTLY 17 SECONDS FOR DEANA COLEMAN to ask me if I have been drinking! A NEW WORLD RECORD! You're asking me to leave the house I bought for you?! Very good. William Whitaker, junior. The man of the house. Nice of you to call me back. You are? Are you the man of the house? I'm your father, tough guy. You don't know who the fuck I am! What did you say? I'm outta here. I'm outta here. I know where I'm not wanted. Folks, please give us some room.  At the appropriate time I will tell my story. Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured. Thank you. I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace. I'm Captain Whitaker, I was- Can you get me to my car? Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured. Thank you. I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace. Hey, Charlie. Thank you. Amanda was so nice to let me in. It's just...I couldn't find a safe place. I think it's okay. I've been watching and I think it's okay. Okay. Good then. Listen Charlie, here's the deal- No. I can do this. Let's just stick to the plan. This whole thing has just been so heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh, I can do it. Look, I really wanna fly again, get back to my life and be done with all this shit. Let me stay here. They have my houses all staked out now. Let me stay here until the hearing, Charlie. I won't leave the house. I won't drink. Thank you. I feel really good. 9 days...  Two hours and 26 minutes...but who's counting? Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting me stay with you. I needed it. You've got a beautiful family. So does she have the knife out for me? Hello? Anyone? Yes!!! I'm dead!!! Amazing grace...how sweet the sound...that saved a wretch like me- I once was lost and now I'm found was blind but...now...well I'm still kinda blind. Call Harling Mays. Harling's got cocaine. 609-237-1184. We're in 609 so just... 129 Tell him I need bananas... 129 The banana boat is here. Thanks brother, I'm back. I love you too. Do not tell me how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. Morning. I'm not sure it was conscious. It was more of an instinct. I don't recall. I heard a metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control. There was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft. Yes. There was some convective activity in the area. However, my first officer and I discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums. I appreciate that. Yes, I understand. No. I did not. No. I did not. No. Yes. I suspended the drink service. Yes. I am now. Outside of work? Not really. No. I did not. No. I did not. No. I did not. Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry. My what... I SAID...God help me...  IT'S MY OPINION...  It's my opinion... Trina DID NOT...drink the vodka.  She saved that boy's life...  I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE DID NOT DRINK THAT VODKA... ...because I did. I drank the vodka. I drank the vodka bottles on the plane. You don't have to readdress anything. I DRANK THE VODKA! On October 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th I was intoxicated. I drank alcohol on all of those days. I drank to excess. I was drunk. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block...I'm drunk right...  I'm drunk now, because... Because I'm an alcoholic. That was it...I was done. It's as if I'd hit my life long limit for lies. I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I had just told one more lie? I could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly I would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months. It looks like I will serve every day of the remaining 4 plus years of my sentence. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's what the judge explained to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA took my license. And that's fair. The chances of me flying again are slim to none. And I accept that. I've had time to think about all of it. Doing a lot of writing. I've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight. Some were able to hear my apology, some never will. I've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife, I mean my ex wife...  ...and my son. Again, some were able to forgive me...some never will.  But at least I'm sober, and I'm grateful for that. And this is gonna sound really stupid coming from a man who's in prison...but for the first time in my life...I'm free. Knuckles, you're looking good.  I sent you something for your birthday. This is a real surprise; a great surprise. I haven't seen you- Great. An interview. Okay. Listen Will, it means everything to me that you came here. You are an amazing kid and you deserve great things... Yeah. Of course. And that's me? Okay. Good question."
witness,BOOK ,Harrison Ford," You found the body? What kid? Hi, kid. I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name? There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there. Who'd you see? Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor? Anybody know about this?  Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?  Black... I understand. What else,Sam? Try that one again, Sam All right, talk. We were running Zenovitch... That's all I can tell you. But I want it, Terry.  I've got a call into Schaeffer.  I'll buy a dog. Go get a cup of coffee, Stan. Oh, he's good. Yeah. Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed. Maybe. Maybe. If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months. The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing. What's-her-name moved to Buffalo. Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area. Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide. Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that. You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, I know a little about the Amish. I know this has to be an ordeal for you; and I'm really sorry you an Samuel got involved. What was that? Book. John Book Sammy, where's Coalmine? Coalmine. Put some light on him.  Look at him. Sorry. It's important. Where's Timmy and Buck? You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs? Oh sure, Fred. They're Amish. Now what's the problem? Whacking? Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify. People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail. Look, I'm genuinely sorry... They kid a lot. What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.  Just wanted to see if you were on your toes. No. Oh? Anything else? Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a little help.  Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved. Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops. You'll be safe. You don't have to worry. Look, they're thinking as long as they keep the killer out of Samuel's way, we can't make an I.D. There's no way they can know Samuel saw that photograph, so he's safe. I mean it. You will be safe. It was McElroy, Paul. Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it. If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac. (excited, explaining the thing eagerly) He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum. Just us. More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.  A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days. Just us. No! No hospital! Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight. Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.  Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it. Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...  Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass. Put my car in the garage and close the door.  You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.  Just do it! Home. I was wrong. I can't.  There isn't going to be one. No, no doctor... Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me. And when they find me, they'll find your boy!  Who are they? Can I have something to drink? Does anybody know I'm here? How long? How long have I been here?  Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go. Tell him his tea stinks. Give me that. Come here. You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel? Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand. Call me John. You don't want to point that at people you just started calling by their first name. Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun - Put it up someplace Samuel can't get it. Friends? Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that? Your husband's? Something wrong with buttons? Hochmut?  Anything against zippers? Quaint? Can't imagine why. Where's the nearest telephone? No. I'd want a public phone. I'm going this morning.  I know what he said. Rachel. Thanks. My... eh... gun? The... bullets?  Not much good without them. It's me. Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I? I'm coming.  I hear you. I'll stay in touch. Where I'm at is maybe 1890. Make that 1790. Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?  Milking? I've seen pictures.  Not one this big.  Careful, son  You don't say. I thought I was the English. Try the house. Pigs. Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler? A real fireball. I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.  I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking. Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job. Guess I'm not used to so much. Sure. I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea. Hi... Not long... A few days. You like it... Don't you?  Next thing you know you'll be off drinking beer and racing motorcycles. It's not her fault. I All right, you nasty son of a bitch, we're going to be friends whether you like it or not. See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't you for Christ's sake? Won him over just like that. Later. It's been a while.  Pretty much. Yes, sir. Hey, Sam...  What's that, Sam? Same to you, Sam. Sam? Last night. If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't leave. Maybe I ought to learn to drive this thing.  Pick myself up another useful skill.  Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.  Lady, if you take my picture, I'll rip your brassiere off and strangle you with it. Lieutenant Elton Carter, please. What? I'm a friend of his. You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out. I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you. You might want to pass it along to Mac. I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.  You're making a mistake.  Pick up the hat. I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.  There was.  I know. No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life. Aren't you? After today?  Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.  Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do! That's your way, not mine. Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!  It's them, Sam. (he bends to the boy, takes him by the shoulders) Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before. Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there! I'll be all right. You just do as I say.  I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!  Hey, Mac! It's okay, Sam. You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer. It's all over, Paul. Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars. Sure have, Sam. Where's my baggy pants?"
valkyrie,STAUFFENBERG ,Karl Alexander Seidel," Now they tell us to disengage - a day late. No matter how many times we tell Command the reality, they always manage to leave us- I wonder... Was there even a point in our coming to Tunis? STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT. STAND FAST, I SAID. NOW. I don't know what I ever did with ten. I'm wanted in Berlin. Are you asking as a member of the High Command? You can speak openly, General. He died just before you came in. I'm a field officer. That's unfortunate for me. I'm a soldier, General. I serve my country. The people chose otherwise and here we are. Now we have to win. You know what will happen if we don't. We all took an oath, General. I'm a twin, you know. My brother died the day after we were born. I was lying in the desert, covered in blood, sure I was going to die. I tried to think about my wife, my children... But my mind kept drifting to my dead brother. How I would finally be with him. How I would finally be whole again... This is my reward for what happened to my men. It's all I deserve. I don't want the damn th- I'm not going to the front. I'm needed in Berlin. These men need no introduction. What makes you think the army will follow you at all? Oust him, kill him. That isn't what matters. How do you plan to take control of the government when Hitler is gone? With all respect, sir, you put too much faith in your popularity.  All of you do. You said yourself, I'm a field officer. You all may understand government, but I know the men. A great many of them may hate Hitler, but they all fear him - they fear Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the Reich. That kind of fear won't just die with Hitler. And as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one thing. Authority. And if just one man questions that authority, you can lose them all.  They were fooled into following Hitler... How will you fool them - force them - into following you?  What are you doing here? I thought I left you in Bamberg.  It's a wonderful surprise. Thank you, brother. I came to join the Resistance, not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians. Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately I have to wonder if Germany is even fit to choose her own destiny. Plenty of people thought- What are you trying to say? I said senior officers. The only men that can get to him. Even if they could remove Hitler, they can't hope to seize power. For God's sake, they have no plan. Children, that is far too- Air-raid. Valkyrie. Not as it's currently written. Hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he's cut off or killed. The orders could be rewritten. A few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command. Now what would the High Command do if they thought, say, the SS was staging a coup? Hitler's   own Reserve Army, using Hitler's   own plan and under our command,   would automatically seize power in   Berlin... Precisely. It will seem as though we're fighting for Hitler Government, not against it. I'm afraid it's the only way. I'm a soldier first, an aristocrat second. And you're neither, Doctor. Now if you want to be Chancellor, you'll do as you're told. But one who's gone as high as he can go in Hitler's Army. It's no secret he's not happy about it. I'd say the General's lost more important things this morning. I am critical of losing the war, General. All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision. In Berlin. I've made my decision, General. I`m here to help others make theirs. We're at war. We must act. Sometimes... rashly. That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander. Second only to the Chancellor. Yes... Quite. We'll be closer than that before we're finished.  Yes, I've been giving that some thought. We should include any field units that are home on leave. I've also drawn up an outline for orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate forces at vital points - state and government buildings, of course, but also the radio and newspapers. Combat groups will be reorganized as reinforced grenadier regiments. One or two of them can be quickly mobilized, eliminating the usual six hour lag. We blitz the government quarter, arrest all Ministers and Party leaders, surround all SS and police barracks. Any officers who resist will be arrested... or shot.  If anyone comes to you, play ignorant. Just tell them-  Why didn't you tell me? Do you think Fromm reported us? You don't mean to say- But Olbricht- That greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move, but it's the only way. Perhaps it's better I don't say. Why haven't you then? None of my associates know we've been talking if that's what you're afraid of. You can't report me. Maybe if you had when I first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath. But now you're just as guilty as- It is to me. I have no choice. It's clear now that without you we have no hope of success. You want us to succeed. Don't you? No. But my pregnant wife, our four children, the Germany I first swore to defend... They demand that I be something different. They demand that I fight for their future even if it means... Even if it means that I never see them again. Action is inevitable. As are the consequences. When they come for me I'll do what I can to hide what you knew and when you knew it.  But don't delude yourself. You were involved in a crime against your country long before you met me. There's still time to redeem yourself. Only God can judge you now. Leave us, please. It's the only time I can relax. Adjut- What for? For Christ's sake. Don't I have enough to do? I'll refuse the promotion. Dammit, I can't handle the work I already- We're not ready. We're moving too fast. For what? Be seated. Do you know how this war will end, Haeften? The portrait will be un- hung... And the man will be hung. Bottom line. I'm engaged in high treason with all means available to me. Can I count you in? Anything is a very dangerous word. What about the Panzer divisions in- First Africa, now France. Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe. We'll see if I can't convince him. Mein Fhrer, if I may... The situation in Normandy is- But- Heil Hitler. They're all insane. Every one of them except for Speer, and he's nothing but an architect. Tell Beck we've found our assassin...  I'll do it myself. Who else, then? Who can even get as close? Valkyrie is very clear. Once the order is given, the Reserve Army will automatically seize control of the government with or without me. Olbricht will oversee operations in my absence. I can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is- We both know there's no other way. Nonsense. You're stronger than you think. You might just be the strongest one of all. The country...  Nina. Listen. I want you to delay your trip. Just for a while. I would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until I'm back from Berlin. Things will be different then. I promise. A few days. If all goes well. Then we can travel as a family. I love you, Nina. I'm one of the inner circle now. They'll make sure I am who I am. Beyond that, they won't touch me.  How much time do I have? We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair in communications. He'll notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world. It's my job, isn't it? While Hitler's inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate Valkyrie and seize control in Paris and Berlin. Even if Hitler survives, we'll have momentum. That could be difficult. This is Goerdeler's idea, isn't it? Fucking politicians. I'll hold off if the decision is unanimous. And I want another man on the committee. A soldier.  Him.  Drive on.  Himmler. Where is Himmler? What do you say?  My briefcase. General, if I may- HEIL HITLER. Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more. A military operation in the hands of a politician. I'll do my job. You just take Berlin. I'd like to place a call to Bamberg, please. As best I can. I know the soldier inside me is a traitor. I wonder how I'll be judged as a man. By God. Bombing in Ebingen. I can't get through.  Like a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it's over his head... Nothing... Indeed. I've got the whole bag of tricks right here. Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a call of the utmost importance. Even if it comes when I am in conference with the Fhrer I'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me. Will Mussolini be in the briefing? I'll need a place to wash up - change my shirt. No room for error this time. Assume I have ten minutes in this heat. Two minutes for the walk, one for the security check and one to the bunker. Three minutes for the walk back. That's seven. Plenty of time. Dammit man, what is it?  See that the car is ready. I have everything I need, Lieutenant. Thank you.  I can manage, thank you. Where are they going? My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing. See that you place me as near the Fhrer as possible. Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent call from Berlin... Contact General Olbricht in Berlin. Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever all communications.  Drive.  LIEUTENANT. We have to get to the airfield at once. Orders form the Fhrer. We're on orders from the Fhrer. We have to get to the airfield immediately. You will step aside. Get me General Keitel. Yes... General Keitel. Stauffenberg here. I can't get past the outer gate. A Sergeant... Sergeant Kolbe says no one is getting out... Yes. Yes. Maybe you can explain it to him. Quiet, isn't it? This is Stauffenberg. Get me General Olbricht. It's been three hours, Olbricht. What the hell have you been doing? Dammit man, I saw the explosion myself. Nothing else matters now. We are committed. Now where is Fromm? Is he with us or did you- Listen to me, Olbricht. Never mind Germany. Never mind Europe. Your life is at stake now, do you understand? If you want to live through the night you'll do exactly as I say. The second you hang up the phone, initiate Operation Valkyrie in Fromm's name. Then go over to his office in force, give him the choice to join us or place him under immediate arrest. Do I make myself perfectly clear? I am at the airfield now. I will be in Fromm's office in fifteen minutes. Be there when I arrive. Hitler is dead. Operation Valkyrie is in effect. You did. Be that as it may, the Reserve Army is assuming control here in Berlin. We trust you'll join us. I delivered the bomb myself. I saw the blast. He is dead. Are you with us or not? No, General. You are.  Lock him upstairs in his private quarters. Make sure his phone lines are cut. You're not in uniform.  Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you. We're getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster. Can we count on the police? I can't offer you any guarantees. The decision is yours and yours alone. Can we count on you? Have your men surround the building. No one gets in or out of here without my permission.  I want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city. Dismissed. ...Deploy troops to seize and protect all Reich agencies. Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices. All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once... Send him in.  It's all right. Send him in. The Fhrer is dead. The SS is staging a coup. We've initiated Operation Valkyrie to crush the uprising and save Hitler's Germany. You have your orders. Join us or face the consequences. Lt. Herber. Come here. Lock him up with Fromm. Send the following teleprint to all Army Commanders... `Broadcast communique not correct. The Fhrer is dead. Orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch.' I saw the blast... Field Marshal Witzleben is right. I am the officer in charge. I am the man responsible. No one else. My actions speak for me.  I'd rather my wife and children remember our last time together. The Fhrer will want to put us on trial, make an example of us. This won't win you any favor. And it won't hide you're involvement. You knew and you did nothing. You're just as guilty as we are. Even more so. No one will be spared."
entrapment,MAC ,Sean Connery," I have a question. That is of no interest. Why.  Are we speaking.  Japanese? Something of a habit? You know the alleged value of this piece from some fucking computer, which has no clue of the price I can turn the scroll around for in 30 minutes. Are you a confederate of my adversaries?  Or are you just stupid. Virginia Romay... Or a cheap cocktail. As in.  I'll have a Gin Romay, please.  With a twist. I'm supposed to be selective. Art and Antiquities Acquisition Advisor, how alliterative... And am I the antiquity? You said.  Everything. Excuse me. Well, they don't... ...as a rule. No, you can't. ...only it's not bloody football! ...it's just that crap Americans call 'football', like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be one! Why you'd want to bring that foolishness to Japan, you're just pissing your investment down a bungee hole. Seriously, put the money into pharmaceuticals or prostitution, something stable. Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial plastics. My favorite thing in life. Coincidence. Staying here, as well.  You are in room...? Will you send a half-bottle of Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138, please?  And some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with. Actually, I was just across the room, dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting Spitzweg.  Until I determined the painting was apparently stolen... Goes against my grain.  The DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6 million you can get for 3.  Can you get it for 2 and a half? My checkbook is in my safe.  You wait here. Just want to see if I'm with the person you say you are.  Can't be too caref... Oh, dear. We'll go in there, and call the police. I have damaged the car of these kind people.  Please help them call the police... May I use a washroom, please. These are my papers, passport, car registration.  If the police arri... That's actually.  Very sweet. Might you have a First Aid kit, of some kind? Better eat first. Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became of a gentleman's privacy? My God, more females? Eighteen, actually.  The leg is fine, but I got sort of...woozy. Lost my stomach once or twice. I'm an old man.  You probably noticed. You should see me without my teeth. Ah.  Mustn't forget to zip up. Odd place, this. What do you suppose they make here?  Video recorders? Bad investment.  The best ones are here today... Gone tomor... I've changed my mind. You can't get it for me at 2.5, can you? You were setting me up.  The correct price is 2.8.  You conspire with the seller to start at 4.6, so I'll be grateful when you 'bargain' him down to three.  Close enough to fool some people.  unfortunately... I'm old.  I know what everything is worth. I am going to the airport.  You are going on to the rest of your life.  Which... ...should be interesting. The hotels deal with that.  The things I need are always waiting at the next one.  I don't carry.  Baggage. Oh, that's highly personal. Young lady.  I am old enough to be your grandfather. A reward for what? You mean.  Not as old as I look. What's hard to find.  Is someone you truly want to be with. Even for awhile. Would that make it more stolen? Something you need? There are all-night chemists... Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable in there. Well.  Wannabe dealers make excellent fences. I'm joking, of course. The Vermeer wouldn't fit. Why, did you do something wrong? The most famous painting stolen this week. If you don't keep up on your craft.  You'll miss all the jokes. I'm so glad I didn't leave Tokyo. There was a call.  While you were sleeping. An art dealer I know.  He has a Monet.  Minor, but it is Giverny. He'll let me have it for 5.3 million. I agree.  This is a bank debit card. It gives the bearer access to an account containing 4.6 and change. I dislike round numbers. I'd like you to go down there, and pick up the painting.  If that's all right. If I'm there, he'll haggle.  You just hand him the debit card, with that...luminous smile.  And say, take it or leave it. Oh, dear.  I thought you so wanted to make a good impression. And along with making an excellent impression.  You will also make 2 percent of the purchase price. That's $92,000.  And change.. For two hours work. Any problems.  Just give me a ring. Of course not. If it was.  I wouldn't pay more than three. You got it? Turn it over. Is there an envelope?  Taped to the back?  In a Ziploc bag? Detach the bag.  Read what's in it.  Aloud. Papers back in the envelope, envelope back in the Ziploc, very quickly, without seeming to hurry... Now take the debit card from your purse, slipping the Ziploc into the purse as you do it, shielding the move from everyone in the room but Okati. Give him the card. This is a test.  Of whether you'll still be alive four minutes from now.  Do you hear me? Now.  Hand him the card, and tell him in Japanese to pretend he is checking it by phone.  Tell him to take awhile, as if he's on hold. While he's checking, look around the room casually, as if searching for the cheesy handbags... All the while laughing, as if you are chatting with someone you actually like. As you're looking around, do you notice any m... Call out cheerily to Okati, in English, 'Where's the toilet?' Wing it. Get going.  Now. You've got what we bought, are you out of their sight? Run into the men's toilet. I know you know how. Are you running? Jump. The window, twit! ARE YOU PISSED OFF? JUST AS SOON AS I'M READY! HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SPORTING CHANCE... ...SOMETHING WE SCOTS LEARNED FROM THE BRITS! Dry clothes, you'll need them. In five minutes. I won't look.  Gentleman's word of hon... I've seen you naked.  Give the boys a thrill. You probably won't be dating any of them, so what the hell. Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps the thief wasn't your size. We have a business appointment. In four minutes. Time has come to tell you.  What business.  I'm actually in. I'm a thief. And now that I've told you. I'll have to kill you. Or... ...you can spend the most interesting three weeks of your life.  Training. ...followed by the most exciting night of your life.  After which, you can walk away with 20 million untraceable dollars... ...which will come in handy. Things being what they are. From now on.  You can valet park. Don't.  Please. Last night, at Fujitsu, I did some business.  While you thought I was in the toilet. Thirty-five super-microchips. Each worth one million dollars. And change. I stole your suitcase when I left you at the bar.  I have since sent it on to the States, with three chips, well hidden. Since you aren't there to claim it, the bag will sit at Customs. Safe.  Unless... They receive.  An anonymous.  Tip. No, entrapment is what cops do to robbers. Blackmail.  Is what robbers do to schmucks. Even adorable ones. Pop quiz. Admit it's a rush.  The best day of your heretofore drab life. Banquo MacDuff.  This is my associate-fiancee, Ms. Duncan. I'm a Scot.  It's a different country.  Culturally and historically. Thank God. What if there's a fire?  In the chamber. Wine. The bloody Japs bought up half the premium clarets in the universe. You may have heard. I'm in charge of shipping some 14,000 bottles, most quite rare, to a number of premium hotels in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, Phuket, and Penang. All of which are destinations on your October voyage.  Five months from now.  However... Wine.  Doesn't prefer.  To be jostled. Adequate.  I suppose. Did we see...a bathing pool. On deck? Mildly.  Interesting. Adequate.  I suppose. Anything sooner?  That goes perhaps from...say, Sri Lanka? To Jakarta. You seem depressed. Because.  You're a greedy girl. There is no wine.  That just bought us a look at their security. What we want is on the boat in three weeks.  Now can we jump? We're nearing the targ... How do I know who you are, hmmn? For all I know, your name isn't Virginia Romay.  Maybe you're a cop. Entrapment, remember? What cops do to robbers. One...two... Smart girl. Consistent.  And rather impressive. All right, six and seven... Three and four... A chalet, I think.  Or an outhouse. Forty seconds. This time, when you raise your arm.  Don't breathe. Very, very nice.  Had a tour with the Mosad, did you? Oh, it doesn't.  But one never knows... You might need it with me. But you will, you'll get it all. You are actually... Quite remarkable. Take the rest of the evening off. I'm relieved to hear you have some. What's amazing, is that only eleven workers died during construction of this thing... Of course, the others were saved by a safety net. Now, as for the suicides, they always jump facing the city.  Avoids that tall fence about 50 stories down, see it, there? Call it a lapse. Oh, it doesn't.  We came for the view. To Ginger Baker. And you get sentimental for him. Every time you order drugs. I could listen to you lie all night. Do you like diamonds? You asked.  Does the machine. Make gold. Gold is shit.  It's six thousand dollars a pound.  Worth your weight in gold...? That would put you at seven hundred thousand. When the light hits you just right.  I'd pay more. Gem quality.  First ever.  God save Japan. A diamond reactor takes graphite, runs it through a combination of lasers, electron beams, and scanning- tunnel mg microscopes. This one uses krypton-fluorine laser, with a new isotope of krypton. The atoms are rearranged.  And the molecule of graphite becoznes a molecule of... Of course. We had booked Suite 9. Down there.  Ten o'clock. Changed my mind.  There's nothing on the instruments downrange.  The longer she flies before she ditches, the less chance they notice on the Bridge. You should lose the oxygen tank at 8000 feet. I hate a crybaby. You can do this. It's over, it's over... Catch your breath, quickly. Hang on for the wake. HOLD TIGHT! If I were you, I'd watch the desserts. Too long ago to remember. Yes, you would.  You're a girl. Anytime you're ready. Better angle. You might want to move aside... May I trouble you for the torch? Or would you rather just dance. Coal into diamonds.  A wealth machine. It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's the only thing worth waterproofing, in case the ship sinks. Hmmn? Why would I bother? Shit.  Well then, let's forget the whole thing. Let's get one thing straight.  I don't work with partners much, because basically, I find most people to be idiots. You, in contrast, are first-rate. And if I think so.  Maybe you should start thinking the same. Now move your ass. GPS transponder.  Sends a scrambled signal by satellite... Precise coordinates.  You could find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert. Fork lift. Unless you've got the keys, someone has to hot wire it. Finish up on the floaters. Over these engines?  Through five feet of steel? Hell, if they do, they don't have the second key to get in. Thank God for redundant security. One, before I beat you senseless, dump you over the side, and donate your share to charity. Or the thing on the right. JUMP, for God's sa... You did activate the floaters. I did say, 'Finish up on the floaters'.  Surely, you heard me. Oh.  Guess I did it m'self. Excuse me? I like a quick study. ...no matter how many stones we make, the diamonds are just an appetizer. My contract.  With DeBeers. Sensible folks, DeBeers.  A world monopoly in diamonds based on one simple principle...something's only priceless if it's scarce. These guys dig up all the diamonds on the planet, just to keep them out of circulation.  Otherwise, you could buy 'em at the Five and Dime... Imagine the chaos we could cause. We're sort of bounty hunters. Our machine is worth far more dead.  Than alive. Promise you an interesting time... Or my name's not Banquo MacDuff. ...well, I would ask what you're doing with the rest of your life. But that's your own bloody affair, isn't it? Not here. It only looks dangerous... You couldn't fall off.  Unless someone threw you over. More intimate.  For a confession. What business.  You are actually. In. Of course not.  You're a cop. An insurance investigator for Webber Assurance, your boss is an idiot named Hector Cruz, you've been there four years and ten months, you're quite the rising star. Nope? Why n... We. Imagine my relief. Ever.  Is such a long time. And it's worth...? How much in shillings? And I tried so hard to hide that. One moment in time, you s... Don't be so hard on yourself.  It's your plan, you should take at least thirty perc... 50-50.  Or you can swim to Taipei. What are you gonna do with six billion dollars that you can't do with four? Your share is 50%.  And one dollar. You didn't even see wha... No surprise. Tired? You look beautiful doing it. Rather steal it. No.  If memory serves. The options seem so limited. Ginny...? This lovely parting gift can be yours.  If the price is right. Good morning. Quite a parting gift.  I would have settled for roses. Ah.  American culture.  Well, that is a joke. Relax.  It's only eight billion dollars. Your Vermeer?  I like this View Of Delft better than the larger one. The sky is more emotionally rendered. Is it easier now? Not pretending. Not pretending you're an innocent. Not pretending you...like me. Here's a tip from an old-timer. Never forget who you are... It gives you someone to be.  When you stop pretending. So.  Our train runs from the museum, through an underground tunnel.  To a mountain. Your model has five vents. Then we will. Seems like overkill.  For one simple jump. ...we've missed the train, yeh. The Bones?  The Scan? An oversight. Jump sooner. I'm too old for this shit! We agreed.  No underwear. I'd lose the underwear. What makes this one so valuable? Except it's Chien-lung, mimicking Sung Period.  The color is far too delicate. It's all right, you have a nice body. When you're old, you can do anything SHIT!  BLOODY HELL!!! Amanda!  Time for my pills! Get lonely?  Sure, all the time. It's healthy. What's unhealthy.  Is denial. Why, Ginger.  This is so sudden. You're in charge of ego and worrying. I'm in charge of keeping you alive. These are plasma jet.  All the force is directed forward, instead of dissipating in a sphere like a grenade. Shut up. You don't trust me, you won't get through this. Try to adjust to that for three more days.  After July 1... ...you'll never have to trust again. Something.  To look forward to. HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE INCONVENIENCE? I can do this. ALLOW US A MOMENT OF CHIVALRY. FIRST RULE.  SAVE NUMBER ONE. It's all right, the security cameras behind the mirrors are working again. Well.  If everything is in order... WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?  IN BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY! FUCKING HELL!  WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING, MAN! I like this. Not being told what the fuck we're doing. I like your not trusting me. Because it frees me to do the same. ...remain in control. Which is a sign of weakness. I like that, too. Please.  Mr. MacDougal will do. My sentiments exactly. Planning to spend much time here? Colonel.  You are touching the woman I love... From time to time. Sure, I'll take a case. Ah.  How much was the Minister told the raid would cost? Which you can now keep. Like a woman.  Of mystery. Glad I have a function, here. And his retinal plate is in there. Our trade for the great train robbery.  All right, let's say we're in the door.  Now what? Modest. And you've set up a laundry. Seychelles? You're forgiven. But those first instructions, transferring the 8 billion dollars. They're recorded in the main computer. Dearest.  The accounts won't reconcile. The money.  Is still.  Missing. The shit doesn't splatter.  Until the first account runs dry. I was hoping there'd be one. It does sound like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Pity it will be over.  In 21 hours. No, ma'am... Only the best of them. Nice of the Colonel to provide an invitation... ...long as I don't have to have sex with him. We'll take the next one. What time tomorrow do the tanks roll in? So all that time, sitting at your computers.  All the research, the access codes your job allowed you to steal, floor plans, schematics... setting up all your bank accounts... Years of work, comes down to....  ...six minutes.  Don't be nervous.  Easy come, easy go. Your share prob'ly works out to, what?  Dollar and a quarter an hour? That I like you, Ginger. The dedication, the skill, the guts... I'm going to see you get everything you deserve. Woman.  If you can't have fun, right now.  You're in the wrong business. So let's see.  Across town at the British Consulate... ...everyone is working frantically to complete transactions before they go off-line at midnight. ...then, deep in the high-tech bowels of the Bank of China Building, just across the square... ...the Chinese are sitting on their thumbs, waiting to come on-line at midnight. I feel for these boys.  Let's give them a breather, hmmn? We'll let the Brits go off-line 4 seconds early. And we'll give our new Chinese overlords 4 extra seconds of rest before they have to go on-line. Playing God here, Ginger.  We've created 8 seconds that do not exist, anywhere but in this room. 8 seconds, where no one is on-line but your little CD-Rom. And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about... They'll each be positive.  The other guy.  Did it. Liable to be an ugly international incident. Baby girl.  Nothing.  Is bulletproof.  Ever. Britain goes bye-bye in 6... 5...4...3. Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank. Feel like a nightcap? Relax, don't jam it... Don't panic, now, there's no rush... Easy with that, there's no ru... The disc.  Is still in there. Was wondering where to leave this... Time to go. Time they find out. Down?  I never liked down. SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY! You can do this. Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to- know' basis. Well.  Something to be said for being self-aware. May I have the last grenade, dear. It's about to rain. You see, banking will be more democratic under China. Well.  No more glass ceiling. How refreshing.  The night air. You can.  If I say so. If you stay.  You'll have to pay for the damage... Now that split.  Did we say 60-40? Got the keys? They fix those things so you can't steal them... These, they're not so worried. Go grab that hook. Let me rephrase that.  Run and grab that hook.  Or die... This only works if you shut your eyes. Of course not.  Now close baby eyes...  Suit yourself. Let go NOW!! Planning. And dumb luck. Good.  I hate you, too. ...if I can't have my usual suite, I'll take my business to the Bristol, simple as that. ...why indeed should I be more loyal to you than you've been to me?  Think it over. You ran your calls. Why?  The CD erased the trans- actions, all accounts seem in order.  It looks like the thieves were stopped in time. Except it never is, really. Quite.  Over. You're not going back to Mr. Cruz, and the nine-to-five? Well.  You want to watch those pennies. You know, for a bitch.  You can be awfully sweet. You know, all night I've been wrestling with something... I've changed your travel plans. Instead of taking the subway to the airport, you change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that? Jordan is only 90 seconds up the line.  Like a wire transfer, you're gone.  Vanished. In this bag are passports, tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a good one.  A dress you can slip on in five seconds. You're on a tight connection to the Trans-Siberian Express, be in Europe in a week. Shhh.  You always talk too much. Time has come to return the favor. One last time. Tell you.  What business.  I'm actually in. That's my girl. See, my profession was cover, too.  A notorious thief has access to colleagues, their plans... I've turned in...well, couple hundred.  over forty years. Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI... Thought I might retire.  After you. Well, the chips were returned. The machine was just a box, did you actually think it was real? Well, the State Department liked that one.  They have more fish to fry with Beijing than Taiwan. So they're taking credit for letting it go through.  Tho I'm afraid your Colonel may be in for a career disappointment. I haven't told them. I said you hadn't revealed the job.  That it wouldn't take place until after the changeover. Don't look, they're there. Well.  Kept my options open.  If I give you up, they don't matter, do they? Had lots of crazy thoughts.  One was retirement.  With four billion dollars.  After all, I know some places where life could be private... Creature of habit.  I suppose. Keep smiling.  They won't move, until I raise my left arm. I thought.  Well, I've got the CD. I could contact the banks, reverse all the transactions... ...except maybe.  Leave you with... oh, a hundred million, say.  To tide you over. Then, I thought, nah.  Not my style. I figured.  What the hell? Let her keep the lot. No rush.  The doors won't close for 60 seconds. There's a pistol in the bag.  Reach in slowly.  Take it out fast.  Point it at my temple. You can do it.  If I say you can. Step onto the car, keep the pistol trained on my face. Seems I was wrong. Entrapment.  Is what robbers. Do to cops, huh? Twenty seconds.  Shoot me in the shoulder, it'll slow them down. Come on, you can do it, if I sa... Ten seconds, hold on. Airport.  Changing at Mongkok Station, we can cut her off. She might lose the wig, be looking brunette or blonde, navy pants suit... I think you're wrong, but cover it. You got maybe four minutes. No problem.  She's trapped."
badlands,KIT ,Martin Sheen," I'll give you a dollar to eat this collie. Watch your heads. Hey. Woody. Gimme a cigarette. Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette.  Ever notice he don't talk much? How do you know? You hadn't tried them on yet. Gimme a dollar for them... Cost twenty new. Why don't you see if they fit you? This lady don't ever pay her bills. She's gonna get in trouble if she doesn't watch out. I throwed enough trash for today, Cato.... I'll see you In the morning. What do you mean? Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I? Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. What's your name? I said mine. Listen, Holly. you want to take a walk with me? Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they? Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like druthers, doesn't it? Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me. Nah, I got me a job. Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay. Hey. wait a minute. When am I going to see you again? What? Sure. He'll say that? Now what's he know about garbage, huh? There you go. I used to throw trash for the City. Wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here. Well. what the hell. Just hope there's a breeze. Hi. Quit my job. Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing? How do you say ""Quit my Job"" in Spanish? Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think? Well, at least nobody could get on me about wearing these boots any more. You want to go for a ride? Bring it along. Somebody dropped a bag on the sidewalk. Everybody did that, the whole town'd be a mess ... Hi. You're a redhead. Anybody ever call you ""Red""? Why not? Yeah? Can I come around and see you tomorrow? Yeah, the tree makes it nice. It's your play. There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it? Somebody else is going to get it. Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea. Yeah. Yeah. Don't ask me. You see where that tree fell in the water? You know what I think? That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today. Well, that's the point, stupid. Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir... Or maybe one that's lighter. Sure is pretty. I wasn't aware there was any law against it. You know Holly... well. she means a lot to me, sir. You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one. Yeah. It okay me leaning on your Willys here? Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you. She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off,  I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it. Takes all kinds, sir. Hi. I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around. Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me. What for? No, you're not either. Cause I can't allow it. Hey... Hey, wait a minute. Suppose I shot you. How'd that be? Huh? You want to hear what it sounds like? Hey, where you going? I came in the front. I can look and see. Well... I don't think that'd work. He don't need a doctor. You don't believe me, see for yourself. I found a toaster. Listen, honey. I don't want to... You said that once already... Too late now. They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding? Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while. Oh... You want to call the police, that's fine. Just won't be so hot for me. My girl Holly and I have decided to kill ourselves, same way I did her dad. Big decision huh? Well, the reasons are obvious, and I don't have time to go into them right now... One thing, though... He was provoking me when I popped him. That's what it was like, a POP. Course nobody's coming out of this thing happy, especially not us. You can't deny we've had fun, though. Which is more than I can say for some.... Mmmm. that's the end of the message. I run out of things to say... Thank you. How you doing? Yeah, me too. Take a break. Red... Life of Riley, huh? He was nervous. Holly! Get in the car, Red. We don't need this. How you doing, Cato? Take that sombitch. What you been doing? Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either. Where'd you get them antlers? Oh, Cato, I want you to meet my girl, Holly Sargis. Isn't that funny? She plays the clarinet, too.  That's what he told you, huh? Let me finish my supper. We're thinking of going down to Texas. Holly wants to visit some of her people down there, but after that I don't know... They say Mexico's nice. Okay. Okay. Put that down. It's dirty. Cato! You never told me about her. Look at all this junk.  I got him in the stomach. He didn't say anything to me about it. Bunch of junk. He stole that cage. I saw him doing it. Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that. Why don't you go in there and keep him company for a while? Well, he's gone. He said not to tell. Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you? No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you. Can't afford to take chances. Come on out of there, young lady. Let's us step out in this field here. Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though. You don't mind? Okay, you two, down in the cellar. You promise to stay down there for an hour? You expect me to believe that? I'm going to shut the door. Think I got 'em? Well, I'm not going down there and look. Just to keep him out of the sun. You tired? Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak. Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie. They're probably going to blame that on me, too, bastards. Hi, I come to check the meter. My tools are in here. Oh, this Is Holly. She's from Texas. Excuse me. Hi. This your place? Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two? Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be? Next time I ring that, it means time to clear out. Listen to your parents and teachers. They got a line on most things, so don't treat them like enemies. There's always a chance you could learn something.  Try to keep an open mind. Try to understand the viewpoint of others. Consider the minority opinion, but try to get along with the majority opinion once it's accepted.  Course Holly and I've had fun, even if it has been rushed, and... so far we're doing fine. hadn't got caught.  Excuse the grammar. Hi. Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick. Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic. Well, he didn't have it last night. What's that? Sure. You have to excuse me now. I have to go back inside. Bye. We're out of here, Tex. Hi, whatcha doing? Good a way to kill time as any... She okay? Listen, ah ... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be? Don't worry, I won't let her drive. Oh, and here's a list of everything we borrowed. Car's on there, too. Okay, ma'am, let's go . . . come on. You're my friend, aren't you? Okay, no monkey business then. Groceries. That guy could sell that list I gave him as a sample of my handwriting. Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me? Anybody ever done that to you before? Positive? Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure. That guy must pay through the nose to keep this place up... Lawn, the gas and electric... Bagworms. Plus the upkeep on the cars... Yeah, you get a little money in your pocket, you think all your problems are solved. Well, let me tell you, they're not. Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat. I don't blame him. I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to. Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching. Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains. Everybody loves trout. Maybe we should've tried to hop it. I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some. Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know. Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place. Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean? Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I? We'll keep on heading for that mountain... Just remember I said it wasn't such a hot idea. I could get a job with the Mounties. The Northwest Mounties ... Hell, I got all the qualifications. I can ride, shoot and... I don't mind the cold. Fact. I kind of like the cold. Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual. I was just talking about going after a job... Hey. don't lip it. Well. I'm not going to let that stop me. You smoke Pall Mall? Nah, you hadn't seen me when I'm going after something, honey. Tough? Hey. don't touch that... Nat King Cole. Boy, if I could sing a song like that... I mean, if I could sing a song about the way I feel right now, it'd be a hit. God, what a sight... Tell me this, honey. What does a little Texas girl like yourself think of a sight like that? Love this air. Morning... Say, you got any gas? Well. I'm sorry. sir. but we've got to ask you for it. See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you. Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it? You didn't walk out here. Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac. Now don't worry. You're getting a fair deal. Hell. what's the blue book value on this thing, Mildred? Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal. Okay, friend. start running. Git. Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter. He's not coming to take us for a ride. either. Come on, let's make a run for the car. Have you got a better idea? What? What is wrong with you, huh? What is the matter with you, huh!? Boy, I don't know what to make of you. People like you. You want a second chance, then listen. Twelve noon the Grand Coulee Dam, New Year'ss Day. 1964. You meet me there... Now you got that? Hey, anybody here? Hi... Say,, you got any shells for a Savage, a .300 Savage? Damn. I pissed all mine away shooting up bottles... You want to fill her up for me? Please? If you want any of that junk, it's yours. Hi. I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains. Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me. You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here. You're going to give me a cauliflower ear, Sheriff. Think I'll take the juice? Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me? You ever had to open it up like that before? Well, you boys have performed like a couple of heroes... And don't think I'm not going to pass it around when we get to town. You tossed my hat out the window. No. Mmmmm. They're okay. I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though. Fine as can be expected. Just locked up, can't move. You think?... it's leather. Hey, now here's a real prize. I must've had this about ten years. Who's going to get it? There you go. South Dakota. Where you from? Want a comb? Yeah, she got out of there, too. Eddie Fisher. Who's yours? Damn! Want a pen? Don't you read the papers? No sir, I hadn't. I hadn't thought about it much. Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now? Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do? You boys keep out of trouble. Sure. You want to give me a little slack here? Don't worry now.. I'm going to get you off these charges... There's a whole lot of other boys out there. You're going to have a lot of fun. Boy, we rang the bells, didn't we? I'll say one thing, though... That guy with the deaf maid? He's just lucky he's not dead, too. Course it's too bad about your dad. We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime. Thank you very much, Chief Sims. Sorry if I caused you any inconvenience. Thanks anyway. Tom... Thanks. I know you do. Good luck to you, too. Come on, Red. Sir... Where'd you get that hat? Boy, I'd like to buy me one of those. Think they'll take that into consideration?"
halloween,LAURIE ,Jamie Lee Curtis," I won't. I promise. Hi, Tommy. Same time, same place. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yes, I am. Just watch. Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of sixth grade. See you.  I wish I had you all alone... Just the two of us... I would hold you close to me... So close to me...  Just the two of us... So close to me... M'am? Costaine wrote that fate was somehow related only to religion, where Samuels felt that fate was like a natural element, like earth, air, fire and water. I think you have too much to do tomorrow. As usual, I don't have anything to do. What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling. Exploring uncharted territory? I thought you were baby-sitting tonight. Shit! I forgot my chemistry book. don't think so...I Annie, some day you're going to get all of us in deep trouble.  I'm baby-sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company. Look. Behind that bush there.Annie looks. That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at. He was standing right here. Cute. The guys think I'm too smart. Okay. Bye. Mister Brackett... It's okay... Yes, sir. Nice seeing you.  Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition. Hi, Mom, I'm home. Thanks, mom. Hello.  Hello?  Who is this? Hello? Annie, was that you? Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death. I thought it was an obscene phone call. I've already lost it. Sure, see you later.  Calm down. This is ridiculous. I wasn't spooked. I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's backyard. He was watching me. He can still watch. I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-o'-lantern would keep him occupied. Thanks.  ...""How now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?'  'That is so,' answered the knight in a bold and haughty manner..."" But King Arthur was always your favorite. Why are they under there? 'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'... Hello.  What's this big, big news? I'd say you must have the wrong number. Annie you didn't. Tell me you didn't.  I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...  Annie!  Hold on.  There's nobody there, Tommy. Go watch some TV. After the movie. After the Jack-o'-lantern. There's no such thing. Do you believe everything that Richie tells you? Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe. There was no one out there. What did he look like? We're not getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The Boogeyman can only come out on Halloween night, right? And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get you. I promise. Fancy. I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around. Yes, you can. Wait a minute here... Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded. The old girl scout comes through again. What's wrong? Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey. I said, stop it! There is no Boogeyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed. Nobody's going to get anybody. Now stop scaring each other. Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now. You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of the movie. Hello. Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight. No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul. They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lindsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed. Have a good time. Finally. Hello. Hello?  All right, Annie! I've heard your famous chewing, now I get your famous squeals?  Annie? Annie, Annie! Are you all right?  Are you fooling around again?  I'll kill you if this is a joke!  Annie... Annie?  Bob, Lynda, Annie?  Hello?  Shit.  All right, meatheads. The joke is over.  Come on, Annie, enough.  This has most definitely stopped being funny. Now cut it out!  You'll be sorry. Help me!  Help me! Please, help me! Call the police! Please! No! No!  Please, open the door! Tommy!  Tommy, open the door! Tommy, let me in! Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs... Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door! DO WHAT I SAY! NOW! HURRY! Please stop... Please... It's all right now. Shhh, it's all right...  Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside. There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed. Yes. I killed him... Lock the door! Lock the door! Tommy, it's me. Open the door.  Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door. Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand? No! Do as I say. Well, kiddo. Some Halloween... It was the Boogeyman..."
thunderheart,RAY ,Val Kilmer," Hey. Nice tie. Ya got the paper? You're my hero, Carl. Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones. Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples. We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl. Louis, my man, what's happenin'? Immaculate. Slam dunk. Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you. Mister Tully. No. No, no. Thank you. It's an honor. South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir? I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think -- Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and -- I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six. Eight murders in less than a year. All of them Indian. All of them unsolved. Is the law a non-entity out here or what? Jesus... Were you in Nam? Not as scary as a Hoover man with a computer. You crashed my file? You've been in the bureau for thirty years. You survived The Hoov, the Black Panthers and Abscam. I don't see any bullet holes. That's good enough for me. Leo Fast Elk... Thirty seven... single... Member of the Tribal Council. Six rounds. 357. Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure. This is a restricted area. I did. -- a fucking cop. Walter Crow Horse. Tribal Police. Leo has to take the journey, Cooch. After we've completed our investigation. Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork. Beats the hell outta me.  Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure. I thought we were staying on the reservation. I see. Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set. Liquor. We heard they like their drink on the reservation, and we were gonna see if we couldn't unload some surplus on the way to Nebraska. Did any of you gentlemen know Leo Fast Elk? Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think. I already did. Couldn't sleep. Done. Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks- Dreamer.  Hello, I'm looking for Hobert Standing- Buffalo-That-Walks... Dreamer. Good morning. I'm looking for Hobert- Buffalo-Dreaming...  Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks-- --Dreamer. Sir? What are you -- What?! Hey.  Hey, you, listen up -- Bullshit. You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track? Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area. You've got no jurisdiction. Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here. -- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota. His spiritual mother... Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security. Crow Horse. Fuck you. Mrs... Blue Legs? Can I ask you a few questions -- Ma'am, Please -- Mrs. Blue Legs. I'm Indian. I'm Sioux. Yeah, right. Shit. Mrs. Blue Legs! It's okay!  Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location. How'd you know? Go ahead. Cooch. You're my hero. Who is he? White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol. They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement. I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down. Alright. Alright.  What the hell is that? On the ground. Hands on your head, Sir. Come on, come on... We're FBI, James. We just need to ask you a few questions. Go ahead. You can all go home. Is that right? What are the trees saying today? Let's go. Medicine. As in medicine man? Why does he wanna see me? What did he say? He knows me? What's he smoke in that? Tell him I'm trying to find the man who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him if he knows where he is. What did he say? He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say? What was he saying? Because he was talking to me. Does he know something? And... So what? The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court? Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster. Mr. Clear Moon. They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation. X22. Read. I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over. FBI, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop it, drop it! Turn around, put your hands on the roof of the truck. That's right. Turn around. This Jimmy's? Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes? He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he? Who did? A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine. Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world. When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay? Move it, Magdelana. It was just Eagle Bear. I questioned and released her. She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. ""What's the FBI really doing here."" Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty. She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's. I gave it back to her. If it is Jimmy's, she's taking it to him. We'll have a runner. But I borrowed a little mojo... Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant? Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty? Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us? For all I know, you're Jimmy. And you're just waiting for a shot at my jugular. Drink, Jimmy. Milk is good for you -- I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance. Have a nice day. She's your sister? Gotchya. We just nailed a genetic match between the eagle feather left at the murder site and one in Jimmy's medicine bundle. It came from a white eagle. Same bird.  -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing. I don't see the connection. That's not solid. You're saying a white guy did it... Alright, Crow Horse. I'm listening. I'm listening to the trees, to the stones. Who is it? The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo? Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing. I can't do that,  It's a Rolex. I'm sorry, this is --  -- this is very, very expensive. It's --  Tell him this is an expensive watch. Don't tell me: heavy duty. Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation? -- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man. Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic. It's not real. I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here. He speaks English. Take care of yourself, Walter. Well we better use those twelve hours to apprehend the right man. Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck. There was also a print found in the Badlands that indicated diagetic locomotion. Heels first. Jimmy's walking pattern doesn't match. He has a distinct Indian walk. They don't smoke hooch in The Pipe, Miles. They smoke something called kinickinick, it's like a tobacco. When did we get that? -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of -- I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed. I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer. Alright. Alright... Thanks, Cooch.  Motherfucker. All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home. It may have been Maggie's way of saying ""get off my ass."" Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says. -- Cooch. Woh. Stop. Yes. Because this isn't a dry wash. It's the Little Walking River. And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river. Listen to the water... Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing? Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man. Cuz you're a cop. What are you talking about? And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you. They found prints at Blue Legs' place. Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is. No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop. I'm sick of your shit -- Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're -- No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that? Never mind. I read, Cooch. Good. No, Maggie. But you're gonna have to join me for a ride. I'm taking you to Rapid City. You burned an American flag today. And left it for me... I desecrated it? If I told you... that I think Jimmy's innocent... but I'm in over my head... would you believe me? NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy. What? Great. You ever see that car before? Who's it belong to? Help me, Maggie... I didn't see you today, Maggie.  Goodbye. Anyone who fought or spoke out against it... wound up dead or in jail.  That was 1868, Maggie... Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I -- Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear -- Hey, put that down. Sherman! Look... I'm not who you think I am.  I'm sorry. Why? Cooch. They sent us out here because the place was being neglected. Now, all of a sudden, there's two five man SWAT teams out there tonight. Bell Huey choppers flying all over the place. Federal occupation to catch one guy. Why, Cooch? What's going on? I'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird. Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it? At Sioux Falls Pen? Leavenworth a tough joint? No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here? Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard? An arrangement was made between you... and us. Do you remember that arrangement? Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver. Get up out of the chair, Richard. Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard. Get up! They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth. Leo Fast Elk... is alive. How the hell do you know? The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them. You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows. Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?! What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English! I'm the fucking law! Keep talking, Yellow Bird... You and me both. Maggie! Crow Horse, listen -- Nowhere. I'm trying to find her. Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me. No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go. Do they come in dreams, these visions? Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo. At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why? Well, it was just a dream, I -- What do you mean? Sorry. We've driven a long way. Where is this place? Yeah. Fitful dreams. What the hell do you want me to do?! What's that? Jesus. Oil? 1868... That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium. Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved. Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again. No. No... This Clear Moon's house? What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird. He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight. X21. Come back. Reservation. I'm on my way back in. Over. You go to the council fire. I'm going back in. No... I had to finish something with Crow Horse. Why didn't you tell me what we were doing here? We're running a cover-up and you didn't -- You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table -- What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch. -- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go... We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it? Crow Horse! Crow Horse! I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead. Bullshit, let's get outta here, He's gone. We're going for The Stronghold. Yellow bird... is gonna sing.  Fuck you. Walter. We're in there. We're in there -- No way, Cooch. You're right, Cooch. It's over. Let the press through. What about the water... Some Indian time? I'll have to see what the visions say about that one. You take care."
excalibur,ARTHUR ,Nigel Terry," I left it in the tent, sir. It's been stolen.... If only Kay could have it...  Your sword was stolen, Kay, but here is Excalibur. Is it too late? I hurried--  Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it. I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness. Please, Father, rise up. I was your son before I became your King... if I am King. Who is, then? Who is Merlin? Whose son am I? ...Merlin... Merlin... Merlin! You saved me from the arrow... I want to thank you. Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--  Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.  I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired... It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I-- How? Where? What book is that? What?! And if I am to be King of everything, lord and commoner, beast, leaf and rock, I must use its voice, its claws, its power. Let's finish this with a show of force. We have no more tricks and no more advantages. You are in my hands, to slay or spare. I need battle lords such as you. Swear faith to me and you shall have mercy. You are right. I'm not yet a knight.  You, Uryens, will knight me. Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy. That duty I will solemnly obey as knight and King. Owww... Ye... But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores... I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter. I'm going. ...of course... I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered. Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.  Guenevere... What's in them? We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go. Where is Merlin?  I should have left you to fend for yourself. So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you. You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge. Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own. I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way? --That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility. Move aside! Then may He give me the strength to unhorse you and send you with one blow back across the sea. I will not. Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me. So be it, to the death. What horror is this?  Merlin! My pride broke it, my rage broke it... Humiliation and defeat lie in ambush even for a king.  This excellent knight who fought with fairness and grace was meant to win. With Excalibur, I tried to change that verdict. I have lost for all time the ancient sword of my fathers whose power was meant to unite all men, to serve the vanity of a single man. I am nothing. Excalibur! Is it true? Thanks to God, you are alive. You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson. But your life and lands are far from here. And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion. Lancelot, how did you fare in the North? And you, Uryens? Lot, and you? You, Gawain, the East? The war is over. One land, one King. Peace. Your ancient wisdom and infinite sight have forged this circle, Merlin. Hereafter we shall come together in a circle, to tell and hear of deeds good and brave. I will build a table where this fellowship shall meet. And a hall around the table. And a castle about the hall. And I will marry. And the land will have an heir to wield Excalibur. Knights of the Round Table, good friends, brothers in arms. I send you on a quest harder by far than the battles we have fought together, a quest to uphold always, and everywhere, justice, honor, and truth. Each day shall bring forth a cause, and may each cause bring forth a knight. I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me. Sit beside me, Lancelot. Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.  I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers. ...to ride out and meet them. I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here. Without Lancelot?! Enough!... What is a fair price for the smell of your ale? What does it cost to get drunk on your ale? Give me three shillings. For the smell of your ale, the jingle of his coins. Merlin, are you counselor to the King, or to my sister? Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems? Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom? Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen. The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf. It is. Lords and knights of the Round Table, as her husband I say that this deed was not done by Guenevere. Who among you will champion this truth? Sir Caradoc! You! If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband. The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come... Is he coming? So it is. Boy, kneel. In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir... Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me... Will I have a son? Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me. They miss the battlefield. I think we do too. It is not easy for the young ones to learn knightly virtues without the hard teaching of war and quest. It is only your example, Lancelot, that binds them now. Which is the greatest quality of knighthood? Courage? Compassion? Loyalty? Humility? What do you say, Merlin? I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it? Hasn't Merlin mended your wound? You will be sorely missed. Heal yourself and come back. I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister... With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at... Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight. I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin? Has no one seen Merlin? Guenevere! You are-- Who will ride the labyrinths of the forest, to the very root of his soul, to the very ends of the earth, to find the secret that will redeem us from the evil that has fallen upon us, and make this chalice, and ourselves, whole again? Gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, that we may never meet again, that the fellowship will be no more... Kay, I know your heart yearns to go, but I am prisoner to my duties, and you must be to yours, at my side. At last...  ...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was... (he turns to Kay and with sudden harshness) ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must. Rise, Mordred. I recognize you only as my son, no more. Your mother told you that? I cannot offer you the land, only my love... So be it. I didn't know how empty was my soul until it was filled. Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule. I am Arthur. Guenevere, accept my forgiveness, and put your heart to rest. We have suffered to long. I have always loved you, and I still love you. Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be. I never dared to hope all these years that it was in your keeping. I have often thought that in the hereafter of our lives, when I owe no more to the future and can be just a man, that we may meet, and you will come to me and claim me as yours, and know that I am your husband. It is a dream I have... Guenevere... What horror is that? I am outnumbered ten to one by Mordred's forces. Merlin, I need you at my side as you were once, my friend, to give me courage. There are no war tricks that will fool Mordred. He was weaned on blood. More than I ever did, I need you now. Where are you, Merlin? Is it true that Morgana has trapped you? ...If only you could be at my side, Merlin, to see me wield Excalibur once more... What is this place? It is rumored Merlin, that you drew your power from these circles... Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives. What is this place, Merlin? Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana-- Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin! Merlin?! Of Merlin? I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there. Kay, you will lead the attack. Perceval, you will stay with me. Be cautious, my brother. In this battle there is one thing I must do, that no one else can. Find Mordred and kill him. Lancelot?... It is Lancelot! Has anyone seen Lancelot? Squire! Here! Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die. You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together-- She is, Lancelot. But for Mordred. Where is Mordred? No, Perceval. Now it is time for me to raise my sword.  Mordred, prepare to meet your death. Draw the spear from me. Do it. There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you. --Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it. Obey me, Perceval. You must act for me. It is my last order as your King. Do it, and be back! When you threw it in, what did you see? --By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!"
stepmom,JACKIE ,Susan Sarandon," ...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple. I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you are in the purple family. I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches? Never say 'never' -- it's not fair to say 'always' -- and no name calling. Use your words. Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  Terrible name for a planet. I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  Hate.  Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that. Excellent point. I hate to say goodbye.  Eskimo Kiss.  Russian Orthodox Wedding Kiss. She said we're getting remarried? Mrs. Franklin we're not -- Remarried.  There is no move. Are you here? Because you don't really seem here. Something's up wi... Excuse him.  He never learned how to turn the darn thing off. Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age -- We're not discussing your age. They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.  This man would walk thru fire for Annabelle, gladly, any day of the week. Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up -- Thank you Luke. It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her. You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes... I'm worried. Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Easy enough. Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen. Well you're telling your teachers and your friends -- Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in. Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like... Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty. It happens. That will never happen. Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it. Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but... Thank you Ben.  Annabelle! How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride. Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother? We don't have any coffee. Annabelle, how's your video rep... What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you? What did you do? ...a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and I have already told her she is far too young to own.  But you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with... How much time have you got?  Let's start with this morning.  Why did she run from this room? I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers. Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards? You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out. Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother. Get out! You got to hell! Machines do not EAT message. Of all the cheap excuses.  To break a child's heart. Don't worry, sweetie, there's still the Harvest Pageant.  And you are the lead vegetable... And nothing.  And no one.  Can keep me away. You paged us? Just outside the big top, we're almo... At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I said I'd get 'em back tonight...  ...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her? Don't tell me.  Another machine ate another message?  Boy, there's a lot of that going around!  Put her on, huh? Think twice.  Before you ever pull that again. Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright? Shhhhhh! Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now. See?  No one's laughing at you.  Your friends want you to join them, Anna- belle.  Corn is a very important part of the Harvest Produce.  Now Ben, walk your sister over to the Yams.  You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children. Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been... Not to me. I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer. We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke? I am not here to make it easier for you.  These are my children.  They don't want to be with you.  A court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children!  Ever again!  Do you HEAR that? Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.  No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job. Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid. People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money. Yes...if you like big hair... What honey? You know, you can come inside the house. Called him.  We set an ap... You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for their well-being. Slugs.  Have faster learning curves. Trees, even. And I'm supposed to care. Like you cared about me three years ago? Maybe you should talk to your daughter, about why.  She seems to have missed that part.  Forget I said that. One last chance, don't make me regret it... ...or you will, too. Wait...what time is it? Oh, I'm waiting on some news, that's all.  Say.  Can I ask you why you never asked me something you probably asked Daddy anyway? Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about? Well, not exactly s... Scream. How would you know sh... ...why do you think? So why are you asking me?  Same here, huh? I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but... I overhead what you told Annabelle. The lie. I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite... You're not terribly good at taking care of h... Those are my children you're practicing on.  They deserve first- rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day. So why did y... I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park. However many.  It's not enough. Fine, forget it. Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms... Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...? Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish? Here's their schedule for this after- noon.  I'll meet you at the park at five.  All I ask is that they're alive when I get there.  Thank you. Mr. Samuels?  Forgive the intrusion, I'm Jacqueline Harrison, and... ...well, I just wanted to thank you. For your generosity. ...my daughter had a terrible emergency yesterday.  My husband and I couldn't be reached, and...your Ms. Kelly came to Annabelle's rescue. I'd hate to think what might have happened. She told me that you were so suppor- tive, even at great inconvenience to your business, and... It's wonderful to see a successful man.  With that sense of priorities. If I can ever repay your kindness.  It would be my great pleasure. ...and your Ms. Kelly?  A remarkable young woman.  I don't even know what that means. Spread.  That is very unclear. But the other time.  You said you got it all.  So you could be wrong again. One time, you say one thing, then... But we can beat it. People beat it, don't they?  All the time. So we'll...radiate some more? That's necessary, huh? I guess a no-hair day beats a bad-hair day. I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri... Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit... You don't burden others needlessly. That's how I was raised, Doctor. Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...  Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...  I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up. Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...  Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it. Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting. Just not to me. To make it easier for them or you? You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient. WE are over. No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own. The great thing about life is that things keep changing. And we all went through that together? Look she's upset -- Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did. Annabelle...Rachel's not taking my place as your mother -- it's just Daddy's chance to be happy again.  Isn't that what we all want for each other? Come.  Sit. Life is full of hard things.  And we can't always have what we want, you know that. But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse. Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us. Because I'm looking ahead.  And you know what I see...? Time will come.  When we all need to be there.  For each other. That happens.  To families. I'm counting on it. It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.  That is so pretty.  You usually only see that color in people's teeth.  Well.  It's for you. Just because.  Just because I love you.  Go ahead... Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine. I hope it's the right kind. Well, I thought.  You know, why wait? Like a big sister. I bet. Secret's safe with me.  Hey, good-lookin', I was just thinking about calling y... Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti. You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden. Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller. I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what? Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what. Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup. Hey, that's a world-class laugh you got there.  Can I all you sometime?  If I fell blue. That I do.  Always will. I'm fine, ba... Nope. We can only have two.  Thursday's fine... I looked away for one second... Just one second...he's...he's... He's my son!  He looks like his father!  His name is Ben -- he answers to Harry -- YYYAAAAAAAHHH! ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD SUFFOCATE IN THERE!!! You got that right. Pushing her hair over her eyes. Means she's avoiding a confrontation. If she's twirling it, she's playing something out in her mind.  If she's stopped combing it, she might be depressed... Anxiety. She was angry at herself. Yes? I'll keep it in mind, and use it against you.  Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know. Yeh, that does tend to make me sick to my stomach.  Actually, I'm, uh... ...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis. Well, I could do most of it from home.  But, while I'm working it out with the head editor, I'd need to... ...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight. Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay? It is.  It's about time. Stop.  You're making me insecure. It's temporary. Not the term I'd use. Never stand between that kid and a meatball. Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that. I'll drop him at Tucker's party Saturday, if one of you guys can pick him up.  I have to go into the City. You know what happens to spaghetti when it waits around for you too long? Pray.  We never find out. Okay, what is this?  If you want to dump Luke on me, no sale.  You're stuck with him. I don't know wh... My boss. You WHAT? Don't flatter yourself. Nobody likes a snoop. I'd have thought this was the answer to your prayers.  Lose the witch, and her two brats, in one swoop.  Problems solved. Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and... Did I hear the word... Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob... Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups? Sure, I could.  If I was looking for one. You're a moron, kid.  You guessed the wrong secret.  Charlie Drummond used to be a colleague at Random House.  I'm crashing at her place, while I take some new protein injections my oncologist recommended.  I can only get them in San Francisco. Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope. No such luck.  I'm beating the shit out of this.  Pardon my French. How the hell would you know? How would you know anything? I exercise, I eat the healthiest foods, you live on pork rinds and Ho-Ho's, and I've got cancer! You are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth.  Who I have loved from my heart for twelveyears! And you walk in.  You smile that smile.  You move that boy.  And he's yours for free. And you.  Love my kids.  How fucking touching. They came out of my body! I have given them morelove and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years! Ironic, huh? Ironic, that I'm gonna need you. To be a little less.  Undeserving.  Drink your tea while I go vomit. You love my kids, that's a start.  We'll work on it. I thought a phone call was inappropriate. I could have taken you to that restaurant, but it would have been a waste of money.  I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.  Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'. I live or I die. My compliments.  On your learning curve.  Mommy's sick, guys. I have cancer.  Do you know what that is? Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad. Actually, I'm getting better already. I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller. I'm still sick, but I'm better. That's right.  And you're mad. I know how scared I get when you're sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr... We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m... I can't hear you. ...I'm not deaf, y'know.  In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight... Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born. You think she's the Queen of Cool? Does she have a tattoo? And...? She is but an arriviste. A newcomer.  She's still got a thing or two to learn.  I held you...held you so ti-ight...  You sing lead, you've got the voice... The stud and I will doo-wop. Small world. You're a cross-dresser. She hasn't mentioned this. Moi? ...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once. Oh, my God. She's devastated. And you said...? Well, did you really think you'd meet someone at eleven that you'd spend the rest of your life with? What's Thursd... I could help with the debate.  Actually.  I could only help him. You don't like his friends. You wouldn't kiss him, huh?  Good girl. And what do you do wh... You have to ignore him. He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys. All he wants is the attention. When he can't get to you, he'll try harder for a little while.  Then, he'll give up.  It'll be no fun. Oh, yeh. How many devilled eggs can you eat? We can always go to the store, if w... Tucker, is something wr...  Why? BEEEENNNNNN! Don't move!  I don't care if you're a dwarf, so long as you do your job. BEN!  I'M COMING!  STAY THERE! MOMMY'S COMING! That's absolutely out of the question. BEN!  I'M HERE! Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me... Where Ben? Ben where do you have to get to? Ben.  God doesn't like visitors. Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day. That's right, Ben.  That's why Firemen have giant ladders and climb up and down poles.  They're like... messengers... carrier pigeons... between heaven and earth.  God...I will do anything...I will go through any amount of pain you give me.  If you'll just let me see them grow up. Is that asking so damn much? Annabelle...wake up honey... Nothing sweetheart. I got Ginny Weintraub to come stay with Ben. How'd you like to go someplace special with me?  Right now. Hold tight, sweetheart. I'm never, never going to forget this. You're old enough to learn the loophole.  You can say 'never, never'.  If you mean it enough. To say it twice. Promise. I can never figure weather.  Last trip, I made all the wrong choices. Can't complain. It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back. See, I'm not going to Houston, after all. There's this clinic in Montreal. We've studied their process, we like their success rate... They combine some compounds that have been getting results in France, with vitamin injections.  Seems to activate the chemo... It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat. I really look like shit. Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there. Prob'ly low percentage on mothers. You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the really big issues keep swamping y... You don't have any pot, I s'pose? The primo stuff is great for pain. So.  She ignores this little Kovitsky punk, takes the high moral ground...  He's relentless.  A major asshole. What else?  Keep on keepin' on. She has to stick with it.  Have the patience, the guts, to ignore the pain.  You disagree?  Hi.  How's the vitamins up there? Having big fun? Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there? How's she doing with Brad? Thanks, but it's under control.  It's covered, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her? Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B... I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk straight up to that little jerk... No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth. You use your words. It's a miracle!  I can walk! Okay.  These are good. I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar... ...go to the park.  In the worst way. Serene means you accept. Part of me hasn't quit yet.  And the other part is still pretty outraged.  When it's not terrified. I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out? Have you lost your mind?!  You fought years for that job!  And you quit?? Do what you've worked your whole life to do? You mean, after I'm dead? Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge. Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.  I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term. That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They need you to be happy. Cause if you're not, the easiest person to  blame is the guy sleeping next to you.  And you'll push him away, and then hate him even more when he goes, until finally you have no choice but to leave.  And that can't happen. Feeling the pressure? Ben was born in two hours, went right to my breast and camped there for three days.  Always with this...mischievous look... Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He loves to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician. Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world. The doctor wanted to go in and get her, but I knew she'd come in her own time. That's who she is.  Don't let anybody rush her.  What? Is that what he told you? Well, he got that part right.  Who in the world is he? He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?  Now we're going to have a fight, you and I. And I'm going to win. Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'? Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b... Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother. You are defending what you did? You put filth in my child's mouth. You had her lie about that... that fancy-boy model! So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck. You taught my child that I am some limp dick loser.  Who didn't care about her pain. You think I didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think I couldn't figure out some low blows? Well, maybe your version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'. Mine.  Is a little different. See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some real growth. Shut the fuck up.  I didn't go behind your back. Doing the right thing.  Knowing who you are, inside.  Not caving to peer pressure, or lowering yourself to that level, steering your own course... Well, that's what parenting is about, little girl.  They are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell showed her. And there will come another moment. When the stakes are really there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was. You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back. You've got a point there, for a change.  Oh, yes you do. You didn't get morning sickness for seven months, you didn't breast feed till your nipples fell off, you didn't spend every minute of every day thinking and planning and knowing that your decisions were shaping the people they were going to be... You are gonna be taking Ben's training wheels off.  You are the one my little girl will confess her first love to. You will see them married, you will play with their babies, you fucking BITCH, I hate your GUTS! Thanks for coming out. Luke called.  He says you're checking out.  Of the Heartbreak Hotel. She likes a Stolie, no ice. What's this about?  Because we fought? No, there isn't. What do you see?  Down that road. Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here. Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back? Well, maybe you weren't. Trade you a smoke.  For a secret. You know, I lost Ben awhile back? In a supermarket. I lost him.  I was panicked.  I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you. He only remembers I found him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you. Why didn't I? We were competing.  Even then. Instead of being partners.  Watch- ing each other's back.  Seeing things were covered. You're not scared you'll think you don't measure up.  You're scared they'll think it.  That's the JFK thing, yeh? What do I have that you don't? You're the hip and fresh. You'll learn. I have their past. You.  Have their future. Don't you get it?  You look down the road to her wedding.  You're in the room alone with her, fitting her veil, fluffing her dress.  Telling her no woman was ever that beautiful. And your fear is.  She'll be thinking.  I wish Mom were here. And mine is.  She won't. Now that's enough fear for either one of us to kill the other.  And no jury in the world would convict. We're guilty, girl.  Of being human. And we can't forgive ourselves. But I forgive you.  Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes. Some things to say.  To the kids, huh? Then, bring in the presents.  We'll have big fun. Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first. Scrapbook. Find the bird cage? Well, don't make him disappear before I see him. Oh, look at this. That's you and me.  Our first photo as a couple. This good-looking.  Was beyond my imagination.  So what do you think we're gonna talk about? The secret of it.  That only magicians.  Can ever understand. See, when we die.  Our body goes away.  Our body.  But we...we are not our body, are we? If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is. Half.  Of him. Dying.  Is where the whole body goes away.  So you can't see any of it.  But... What do magicians know? Just because you can't see it. Doesn't.  Mean.  It's gone. The world.  Thinks I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.  Right here.  Right here.  Inside the magician.  Shhhh. Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in here.  You'll know.  What I'm saying. No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we? But God does let us keep the one best thing we have together.  The one best thing we've always had. Know what it is? I love you.  And you love me. It's worth a lot.  Will you keep it? Don't. Take me with you. Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.  Let me be the judge of that. There's an amazing thing when a woman has a daughter.  One day you look up, and you see...a sister. Someone.  You can say.  Anything to. I wrote a whole lot of letters.  To each of you.  And the envelope says when to open it.  Like, which birthday.  Or...when you get your driver's permit.  First time you see Rome.  Things like that. Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once. Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going. Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad. Good.  That's very good. What you're grown-up enough to know.  Is that people.  Can do two things at once.  Okay? You can miss me.  And.  Take me with you. When you're in trouble.  Have me there.  When you fall in love. Have me there.  You can. That's how we go on, you know. Forever.  Because someone takes us along. On your wedding night.  When your babies are born.  I want to be there.  Will you take me? You made my life wonderful. Take that with you, too."
obsessed,DEREK ,Idris Elba," Why? BETH'S VOICE Do you want people to think we put it up?  I don't know. I kind of like it. All I'm saying, before we take it down... maybe we should try it out.  You know. Christen the new house. What do we need a bed for when we've got a fine shag carpet?  Told `em I'd be late. Kyle? That boy wouldn't wake up if a nuclear bomb went off. Won't be here for another hour. Isn't THAT why you married me? Want me to stay?     Crack the whip on these guys? Excuse me? Right.   Gage/Bendix.   I work there. Do you have an appointment with us? Actually, you do.  You're a temp? Well, you could have fooled me. No problem. Happen to anybody.  Are you following me? Derek Charles? Oh, yeah, I know him.  Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay too seriously. But don't tell him I said that.     L ISA I could get you into trouble? Deep trouble. Total chaos. Lucky for me, I sneaked out as soon as the movers showed up. If she calls mad -- and she will -- tell her I'm in a meeting.  Good point. Matter of fact, I just got off the line to Berlin. Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock Market's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest. Hell, no. I think he's a hundred percent wrong. We haven't even gotten close to that point yet. Hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it's gaining mainstream acceptance. You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream. He started making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead... to the tune of 155 mil. I think she's one of the temps. I'm moving into a new house. Do I look like a man who wants a divorce? Thanks, but I think I'll stay married instead.  Sorry but you set me up. About what? Well, that just proves he's got `em all fooled. Well, it was nice to meet you, Lisa Sheridan. Good luck with your next job -- Damn.   Almost made it. Hey, little man. What's wrong?    You should be...  Uh oh. Poopy diaper. Beth... Whew.   What's that woman been feeding you? Toasted Kyle -- But I've saved the most important toast for last...  To my beautiful wife who I love and adore more than anything in the world.  Uh huh?  Yeah? Give the magic mirror another test drive?  Beth, you are so bad. Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp.     Where's Patrick? Hey Marge. Grab your pad and follow me. How's that? It's like that in most companies. They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the party is about. Just the opposite.  No, it's perfect. Well, it's Monday and first thing on Monday... Took care of what? Thanks. Three years in March. It's kind of a tradition. Well, it took a little more than roses.  We need to run some calls. AMUSED) Are you always this efficient? Well, it's just that most of the temps we get here... No.   Definitely not.  Okay not your typical temp... start with Phil Trendle at Emerson... set up a lunch for end of the week. Wherever he wants but push the Water Grill. Then Terry Mills at Imagio. Am I going too fast for you? I don't know. It's shaping up to be a work weekend. In a sec. Blame it on the new girl. Patrick called in sick and I had a temp on my desk. ETH I thought we had a deal. No female assistants. Honey, I don't control the temp pool. Yeah, she's pretty... plain. Actually, she did a great job... aside from the card. Night... Betty. You kidding? This is a treat. I'd love to but I'm all jammed up.     But say hi to your sister. FWB? What does that mean? And Sheila's got a problem with that? Lisa, this is my wife Beth.       Beth, Lisa. She's temping for Patrick. Kyle, say hello. Actually, most people think he takes after Beth.  That was intentional. What do you mean? So? Well, she probably didn't know when to come in. How would I know?    I only have eyes for you.      B ETH  Oh, you are so slick. Come on. I'll walk you to the elevator. You can say hi to the old gang.  Ever miss it? Alright.   You two behave yourselves out here... No. Stay. I was just gonna take this back to my office. Anything I can do to help?     I mean... if you want to talk about it. Most people I know don't cry over nothing. Uh huh.     What are you allergic to? Boyfriend trouble? OUCH!!! That's pretty cold.    How long were you together?  Nothing wrong with you. Your boyfriend's a fool, that's all. Maybe you just haven't met the right guy yet. Actually, yeah.      We both knew pretty quick. It does happen. Why? No, really. If I was single...  Hang in there. It'll happen. Poor kid got dumped by her boyfriend.  Hey, I'm a happily married man.   And so are you. Ben, if you're looking to start something with that girl... Fuck off. I'll have to do it tomorrow.      Office party's tonight. Yeah, Santa. And he's coming soon. So eat. Don't you know Santa only brings presents to boys who eat all their food?  No. Be my guest...  Still the best burger in town. We used to cut loose here after a long day at work.  Back in the day...  How's that boyfriend trouble coming? You know, run the company by 35. Jet by 40. Retire to my private island and own the Lakers by 50. Not with me in charge. What? Oh, I don't know. All right. One.     What do you like? Strawberry? That's Mister Office Asshole to you. All those years watching Soul Train. Why not? I'm sure everybody's glad you decided to show up. What do you mean ""even me?"" I'm your number one supporter around here. Guess we'll just have to take that chance. With Beth and Kyle.       I'm gonna take a piss and sneak out.  What are you doing? Lisa -- Are you out of your -- For god's --  You've got the wrong idea! I only stayed for two drinks. Morning. Yeah.   I'm fine. What?  Really? Sorry I missed that.  No... Tell him he'll have it end of the day. You're working Joe's desk? Don't let him fool you.   His bark really is as bad as his bite. Yeah, go home.  What are you --  We both had a few drinks.   Just forget it.       L ISA What if I can't? Lisa... nothing happened.  You really need to get out of my car. This is so not right.  Lisa, get out of my car! I don't know if you're just dense or what's wrong with you but I want you to understand something. There's nothing going on between us. I would never -- never -- jeopardize my job with a co- worker. Get out!  Beth? Honey? There's something I need to... What's wrong? Tim... told her? Yeah.    That's tough. Beth, you know I'd never cheat on you. Tim's an idiot. ETH He's a son of a bitch.  What did you want to tell me? Forget it. Just a little problem at work. CONTINUED:  Nothing I can't take care of. There was nothing to tell. You think this is funny? What the hell did I do?    I was nice to her, that's all. I didn't do a damn thing. Thanks.   You're a big help. Report it to Human Resources... I don't have a choice. Hi, Connie. Is Hank in?     I need to talk to him. Hey, Hank. Well, it's sort of a personal matter.   I need to talk to you about one of the temps, Lisa Sheridan.  Listen, Hank, this going to be a little awkward... Well, I just thought she was unqualified, sort of in over her head. But if she already quit...  Yeah. No.   I guess not. New house is great. a smile) Couldn't be better. I will. Listen. We'll have you and Kathy over some night when we're more settled. She quit. Yeah.  Looks that way, doesn't it? Hans? Derek. How was your Christmas? Well, you people invented it. You got the prospectus? Great. Look it over. I think it's gonna be a happy new year for all of us. I'm just gonna check my e-mail and come to bed. It's already tomorrow in Berlin. Ganz was supposed to send me his approval. That's probably him.  Nothing. I gotta get a new spam blocker. How could I forget?   I had a hangover for a week after. No, just the usual suspects. Joe says it's going to be a male bonding experience.  Hopefully, they'll all get drunk and crash early. Or if I'm really lucky... drown in the jacuzzi. I will. I didn't order this. I'm fine.      Just thought I saw somebody. Speaking of Beth, I said I'd give her a call before she puts Kyle to bed. I'll be right back. Hey, honey. It's me. They're all getting wasted. Any minute now, Joe's going to suggest the Jacuzzi.  They're yelling for me to come back.  Beth, I'll call you later.  How did you know I'd be here? Why did you come here?  Lisa, you need to leave. I'm not coming to your room. You're crazy... sick.      You need help. Stay away from me! Beth, I'm sorry --  No..  Later! Come back later! You've got to get out of here! Leave!   You've got to go! Just get the hell out.  Fuck... fuck... fuck. Sorry.   Overslept. It's Beth. She's here. MYSTIFIED) I'll be right back. Lunch? What do you think this is?  We didn't do anything last night. It didn't happen! That's exactly what we Right.   A scene. need. What I   should have done last night. Taking   you inside to tell Joe and the others   whatever you want. They'll know you're   out of your mind. e yanks her toward the door. Godammit! I'm sorry... Yeah! That's exactly what I am. A stranger, a person you don't know. Now either go inside and tell them your bullshit lies or get the hell out of here. How else do you look at somebody who sickens and repulses you? ISA Derek, please... I don't care what you do or what you say. What goes on in that twisted mind of yours. It doesn't matter because the truth is, there's never going to be anything between us. So go ahead, Lisa... do your worst. Not tonight, man.   I'm sticking to ice tea. Lisa, get up. Get up or I'll drag you out and throw you in the hall.  This is 622. There's a woman in my room, she's taken an overdose of prescription pills -- Ambien. You need to get the paramedics and security up here right away. Please hurry.  Lisa! Oh god... I know how it sounds but, yeah, that's pretty much it. There WAS NO affair. Maybe I was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way, I don't know. All I know is I did not lead her on. None. I don't even know how she got in my room. Doesn't that prove she did this on her own? She never had a key. How is she? You think I encouraged it? Beth... Stop it, Beth. You know I never said those things. If I did, it wasn't intentional. I was passed out... drunk.     Nothing happened. I love you, Beth. I love Kyle and the life we have together. I would never do anything to screw that up. This girl is disturbed. She's seriously disturbed and for some reason, she fixated on me. ETH Why? I don't know. She's crazy. I know. At first I thought it was no big deal. And then... I was just embarrassed. I didn't know how to explain it to you without looking... I said I was wrong. What? Don't do this, Beth.    You'll make yourself sick. Honey, I know I screwed up... But I've told you the truth.    I have to know you believe me. Beth, don't -- There was no impropriety, Joe. This is just the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl. There was no sexual harassment. If anything, I'm the one who was sexually harassed.  I can't believe this is happening to me. It's like a nightmare. Goddamit, Joe, if there's an injured party here, it's me. That's not going to happen because there's nothing to find out. But Ganz is my client -- She obviously ordered the flowers for herself. My secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer. Lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk. You think I sent the flowers?   I'd have to be as crazy as she is. More?  This is... none of this ever happened. I was never at her apartment. I never even touched her, let alone did any of this... You can't possibly believe this. There's got to be something I can do to protect myself... my family. Why not?  Well, I can't say I'm unhappy to hear she's gone. Maybe now she can get the help she needs.  ""Four little ducks went out one day... over the hill and far away..."" Come on, honey.     Samantha knows what to do, don't you? No way. Do you know how hard it was to get these reservations? Come on, we agreed. This is an important night. And I am not gonna waste you in that outfit.  She looks fantastic, doesn't she? Everything's gonna be fine. Lock this.     We'll be back by ten. Yeah.    It's been awhile.  So... there's hope? I need you to believe me. Could we get another bottle, please? I keep telling you I didn't do any thing to regret. I know. I'll go on-line tonight and order the tickets. Unless you think you should take him alone. Someone was here?     Inside the house? How long since she was here? Kyle... he doctor says he's fine. Now what? Am I supposed to go out and buy a gun or something? No, but she could have. Is that the message she's trying to send? EYES Either that or...maybe she was trying to show you she could love him. off Derek's sickened reaction) People like Lisa... their emotions can turn on a dime. What you don't want is her feelings for you to change to rage. I don't know. But there's a good chance she'll try to get in touch. If she does, you need to call me right away. Meanwhile, you might want to beef up your home security. It's all right, it's all right... Who are you calling? You're not... She won't be there. Beth, why are you doing this? Make sure you set this. It can't go on much longer. They're bound to pick her up soon. THEN) Look, if you want me to stay, I'll call in... Yeah? Thanks.     Hi, honey.   Everything okay? What's wrong? I'm gonna be stuck here pretty late but I could drive down after... Are you sure? All right. Say hi to your dad and tell your mom everything's going to be fine, I love her. And call me when you're leaving the house. Good.    Did you set the alarm?  Beth? Are you there? Beth? Beth?    Are you there? Lisa? Beth --  Beth, I spoke to Reyes.   Are you okay? Beth...  Tell me baby-- are you hurt? It's gonna be okay, honey.     We're gonna be okay-- And I love you--"
cellular,RYAN ,Chris Evans," You recording this? Move, bitch. He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes ""NEW RECORD."" Nearby, a KID watching the game nods. Get that? Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it. C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on that. Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the cellphone out of his pants and hits ""SEND"". Watch it dude, I gotta return that thing in seven days. Nah, whenever I return it, I just list off why the phone sucks and they give me a new model. Figure by the tenth time I'll have to go somewhere else. Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over. Waterproof. But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left leg starts trembling like crazy. This is stupid. I could get killed. Pick another dare. Chad lowers the phone, irritated. Screw it then. In one... Two... Two and a half-- Got any more? I'm here to help. What's in 'em? Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a ""Heal The Bay"" pamphlet. Cool, you're handing these out during the concert? Hell yeah.     I'm all about ""Heal the Bay. "" His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand. Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup thing, of course... An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder, pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now. We've collected water samples with the Stream Team, raised money on the Promenade... I'm surprised I haven't seen you. He offers his hand. Ryan. She takes it. You ever go up to Santa Barbara? My dad used to take me there all the time. Their pier is amazing, clear water, huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish... Hard to believe it's the same ocean sometimes. He's managed to win her back. Sounds like a plan. There's a moment...     Then -- I'll do it for you... if you want. Sure.     How much is the bill? Do you promise not to go anywhere? Okay, I won't be long. Dude, does Santa Barbara have a harbor or a pier?  Dex, wassup? You won't believe the hotties I just met at the pier. Smoking. You wanna meet them? Yeah? Well don't get too excited 'cause I need my money. Ryan stops at a red light. Bullshit, you're not going anywhere,  I'm pulling up right now. Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening. Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels away angrily.  What? Yeah, you better be. And I need your shower, I'm talkin' code red stankage- The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan drives under an OVERPASS. Suddenly -- The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other car's bumper. He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED  Dex? You still there...? And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call. Damn. Sorry, got cut off.      Hey -- what's my Caller ID say? But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds. Yo Dex...? Hello...? Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a desperate hope filling her eyes. Whatever.    Signing off- -- and is just about to hit END CALL when he hears a tiny female voice on the other end. Hello?  Oh really? Kidnapped, huh? Awfully polite kidnappers to give you a phone... Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably.        Desperate, fearful and frustrated. If you were really in trouble, you would've called the cops, not me. Now I've got a real call on the other line-- Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank yanking someone else. Late. Dex? Awesome, I can totally use a credit card. Tell me more. -Shucks, now's really not a good time, but why don't I get your number and get back to you later. That's the office number? Why don't you give me your number instead. That way I can call you when you're having dinner with your family. A beat. Damn skippy. And that's when he notices the message flashing on the phone's faceplate: CALL ON HOLD. Ryan clicks the FLASH button to pick it up...and Jessica is still there. You still there? You're getting kinda creepy, lady. See ya. Oh, it's like that, huh?     Nice with the fake tears, lady... You need acting lessons. Now go take your meds and bug someone else. No, actually( I don't. Not with a hot chick waiting for me at the pier. Why, you writing a book--? Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain. Well, I'd be damn impressed, considering she's dead. How much? Sure you will. I'm hanging up now. What do you want me to do?  I'm here. Excuse me, officer -- But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that suddenly need arrest sheets signed. Hey, I've got an emergency here -- Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a cuffed CRACKHEAD TRANNIE in tow. The Trannie's wrists ache.  Come on, man! I've got some lady on the phone here who says she's been kidnapped! Seriously, a lady was murdered! Take the phone and find out moron! A COP snickers somewhere. Where? What? What is it? Lady, what's going on?! Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her, they stand silently, trying to unnerve her. Oh shit... Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs for the station stairwell. I know.    I'm trying to get help. It's just static. I'm running upstairs to the detectives. Hold on, I might lose you for a sec--  Wait, we're almost there. Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?! Ryan looks at himself, standing on the stairs like an idiot. Jesus!   I'm almost there! Ryan checks the SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR on the phone. There's only one bar left. Defiantly, Ryan takes a step UP...and the bar DISAPPEARS. He quickly hops BACK DOWN. Crap! You're shitting me.  Who? Oh -- one-twenty.nan Good, then if I get a cop-- Ryan exits the stairwell to find Mooney -- but Mooney's not there anymore! There's some NEW GUY -- and he's SWAMPED! Pick him up? Hell no, lady!     I ain't goin' nowhere else-- Ryan tries to get the NEW GUY's attention, in a dream. But I'm in a police station! I just got off the 405. You've gotta chill! You're stressing the crap out of me!  Where the hell is a cop hiding in a speed trap when you need one? Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.    Pushing it against his better judgment. What do these guys want, anyway? What do you do? So your husband's like, uber-rich? Could they've mistaken you for someone else? Oh...SHIT!! Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group of workers -- and OBLITERATES THE BRONCO'S PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR against another BARRIER -- Ryan cringes with every muscle! And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend!  ...Ain't that a bitch. As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away, CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER. More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and -- There's the school. Ryan's right.   Just ahead, we see: Okay, I'm here. Five minutes. What's your kid's name? Ricky what? Ricky Martin? You named your kid Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you tattoo ""kick me"" on his ass while you were at it? Forget it.     What does he look like? They're all wearing blue shirts and pants! Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right.      It's filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS. As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him and wheels him around. Ricky Martin? The Boy's eyes get huge.     He tries to pull away. No, kid, it's okay!    I didn't mean to-- Does he have anything else? A jacket? A backpack? What's his lunch box look like? You don't remember your own kid's lunch box?! Ricky Martin, where are you!? None of the Stepford kids respond. Ricky Martin? I'm looking for a little blond boy--  --No, no! Not like that! Oh shit... Yes.    RICKY! RICKY MARTIN!! Ryan wades through the sea of uniforms. No--! Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone.   The LCD display GLASS is cracked into a SPIDERWEB.  Jessica? You still there?! No one's gonna get your kid!    He's not slow, is he? Then he won't go anywhere with strangers. What color?  Of course it is. PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac Escalades. There's three of them.    What's your plate? Like you don't remember the lunch box? Or anything else about your kid--  Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't it? Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady. Your friends too. Getting me to scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys school. Damn, you really nailed me. I'm done being your entertainment for the day. I'm going back to the pier while I still have a chance -- -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT- YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides ""screw it"", and keeps on hoofing. Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD. Stalking?!     No, I can explain-- The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.  Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a sec! This is a huuuge misunderstanding-- A little RENT-A-COP CAR  pulls up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--nan Oh shit!    You just see that?! Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner in the car.  Goddamn it, that little kid was just kidnapped!! Do something!! Don't worry, I can fix this. It's okay, I can see them ahead. Okay. Damn!     There's this stupid bus-- Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of the Escalade still ahead.  Come on! But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't. Jesus.' Goddamn it! No, I just almost got killed, is all. Thank God?  That's nice. Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over. Hey, here we go! No, No!    just give me a second-- As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine CLATTERING, to the intersection. Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade is nowhere to be seen. He floors it. Jesus!    Where the hell did they go? Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the receiver. Jessica, I-- Are you high?! I just jacked a car! What now? Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out. Great!   Now the battery's dying. It's in my car!      Hold on. SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!    The battery indicator has lost another bar. Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out. Jesus -- !  Not exactly... SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!!     Jessica starts growing afraid. Well what the hell do you expect me to do?! Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED to a halt ahead. He tries to maneuver around it, but is almost immediately boxed in. I know, Jessica! The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately. Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop down a HILL to a strip mall below-- STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of the store's signs: ""VERIZON WIRELESS"". Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter- mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it there. You know that money you promised me? I'm giving myself a raise.  mmmrrmph mrm mrmph! Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings Shit! Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!  Jessica?! Can you hear me?! Excuse me-- Hey! Hey!      I've got an emergency here -- Damn it, will you listen to me?! I've got a life and death call on this phone and my battery's dying! Do you have a charger? Bu t-- ! Help, I -- Aw, screw this... -- Ryan pulls the rent-a-cop's big .38 SPECIAL from his pocket and BLOWS THE SMILEY FACE DISPENSER TO DUST! Oh look! Now serving thirty eight special! Whew!   That was so no bueno! Among other things... Ryan glances at piles of phone gear he's appropriated from Verizon. EARBUD MIKES. MANUALS. RECEPTION BOOSTERS. Yeah, look, about that...  My-name isn't really Johnny Fountain. It's Ryan. Ryan Ackerman. I'm a bar-back. I'm twenty-two, and just a little freaked out right now. Jessica is moved with emotion by his honesty. Oh shit! Oh Jesus!    Oh Jesus!!  Goddamn it, listen to her!     She doesn't know!! Oh shit!   Where's mute?! Jessica...? Answer me, goddamn it I Soon, his voice pierces the suffocating gloom around her and she crawls desperately over to it. You all right?!     I thought they-- What are you doing?    Why'd you lie to them? I can't tell. You seem pretty good at it -- You can't know that for sure. Wait, wait--! It's suicide. They'll kill me! Lady, I've jacked two cars, been accused of being a child molester, obliterated a car dealership, and busted three caps in a Verizon store. -- Don't tell me I'm not trying! Jessica tries another tack.  I'll get the phone to your husband, but that's gotta be it, okay?! I'll be at the airport in twenty minu --  Jessica, this car has a sewing machine for an engine! I can't go any faster! Jessica... ? There's an emotional beat, then-- What do you mean--? Jessica, they have your kid. You had no choice. 1 know. I heard what they were doing to you over there. You held out for as long as you could. Jessica, listen to me. I promise you, I'm not going to let that happen. I could care less about your money. I'm risking my life cause I know I'm gonna get you and your family out of this. You hear what I'm sayin'?  Jessica? Are you still there? Listen dude, this woman's in serious --  Jessica, don't hang up! You hear me?! Whatever happens -- Jessica?!     Jessica?! As Ryan goes mental, a CAR PASSES HIM on the opp9site side of the road -- a new Cadillac XLR convertible! Inside is an appropriately asshole-ish looking guy. He could only be the British Asshole. Gotcha. Ryan pulls a HARROWING 180 DEGREE TURN, barely missing an oncoming car by inches. He RACES up to the Cadillac, which has a VANITY PLATE that reads, ""IDOL MKR."" Ryan looks through the window at -- Give me that phone... or I shoot your car! Cowell is prepared to comply -- but suddenly behind them-- Ain't that a bitch! Ryan turns back to Simon Cowell. Out of the car! Now! Cowell all but dives out. Where's your phone?! Jessica? You're okay. It's okay now. I'm here... Oh shit! SCREEEECH! Ryan steps on the brakes, seeing something ahead. WHIP PAN AROUND to see what Ryan's staring at. Just ahead, JESSICA'S ESCALADE is pulling up to the curb. Your car's here. Ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough- looking men exit the vehicle. We recognize them as Greer, Deason, Ellis and Hodges. Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My grandmother needs her walker... Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and BUMPS into him. As he does, NOTICE -- ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket. Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there. Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands innocently the next line over-- --but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd. Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to walk through the metal detector and... Listen to me! They're clearing the terminal. Before your husband passes me, what does he look like?  That's not enough! What's he wearing? Found him! But -- Holy shit, Jessica, these guys are cops!  Hey, can I go now? Can I go?! The Guard nods, and Ryan takes off like a shot, racing back towards the bar. Ryan spots Craig Martin outside the Left Field sports bar. Ryan grabs him by the elbow and starts hustling him through the concourse. Shut up and keep walking. If they see us they'll kill us both. Your wife sent me. Would you hurry your ass?! You need to hide. They're here, and they're looking for you. They already have your family. Craig looks at him, growing terrified. In here! It's okay. She'll explain it to you.  Okay, Jessica, I'm handing you over now. Forget about the cash. Just get you and y9ur son home safely and we'll call it even. I know you will. RYAN hands the cellphone over to Craig. I'm gonna be outside this door. Don't come out unless I get you. Got it? Shit! Change of plans.      I need to get to downtown fast. I'm already on my-- Suddenly, the cab rounds a bend -- and grinds to a halt from backed up traffic! You've gotta be kidding me!  Can't you back it up? The cabbie tries, but is hopelessly locked in by cars pulling up behind him. Shrugs. About a hundred yards up the road, Ryan sees the 4th Street/Figuroa Exit. He's so close... Aw, screw this! Ryan throws some bills at the driver, hops out the passenger side and starts RUNNING. I have an idea... Ryan fights his way through the tourists to the elevator bay. Quickly scans the DIRECTORY. Among the long list of CPAs, there's a MAILROOM on the 3rd floor. Me?  Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick something up for Mr. Fountain over at the Bonaventure. I'm not sure... They said it was a contract, though, I know that, so what would that be, Legal?  Uh... Right. Tracking number. It's looking grim.   Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.  I might... Maybe it's on the clipboard on my bike? Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and Craig disappear inside the vault. I, uh, may need to call somebody. You believe this? Everyone's got their head up their ass over there. The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to. Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window at the end of the hall.  Screw the package. Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by-- Damn! --he turns around and starts RUNNING UP instead. Sees Greer and Hodges coming.     Big-ass guns out and ready. Shit.' THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM.     PEOPLE start filling the stairwell on every floor. Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof. He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as-- Ho - shit! Ryan bolts to the nearest BUS STOP just as a BLUE LINE BUS pulls up. Thank you! As he flips it open, his eyes spot THE LAPTOP on the floor of the passenger seat. Ryan thinks, pulls out his SECURITY DVD and pops it in. At first, the SCREEN is a mere wash of digital gobbledygook-- And as Ryan grunts with frustration -- --a Hi-Res QUICKTIME MOVIE suddenly fills the screen: I'm so screwed. As Ryan speeds away from the curb, he fingers his cellphone. Shut up and listen to me, asswipe. I got what you want. You know who this is, shithead! What--?    Who is this? *59             A frickin' telemarketer? But I                            159 just hit ""Last Incoming Call""-- Ryan suddenly puts it together. You bastard. The Telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly. Feel like a trade? Gotta love modern technology... My new phone knows the numbers of the last fifty incoming calls. Just the woman and her kid. My name is F you. I've got your shit, pal, it doesn't work that way. Fine.     Your loss.   Nice talking to you. And Ryan hangs up. He waits nervously, sweating, staring at the phone for the longest seconds of his life-- Ring.     C'mon, damn it, ring!   RING! Then it does. Ryan waits a couple rings, slowing his speeding heart, then nonchalantly picks up. Put on a big ass Ronald McDonald smile, apologize to the kid and the woman and bring 'em to the Santa Monica pier. Dude, you're lucky I'm still talkin' to your sorry ass. You do as I say, exactly as I say, or I hang up now and slap this bitch on Nightline, you know what I'm sayin'? There's a long beat. Done. You let me worry about that. What's your cell number? I can hardly wait. Ryan hangs up.    A scared, but satisfied smile... You like it?  Happy Birthday. THUD. The Friends' jaws hit the ground. And as they run to the Cadillac XLR, Ryan disappears into the crowd... Yeah. First show me that Jessica and the kid are okay. Yes.     Where are they? Hang on.  Okay, got it. Greer muffles the phone against his leg.     Whispers to Ellis: Yes. Greer muffles the phone again.      Whispers to Ellis. No. Put them on the Ferris wheel. I want to see them safe first. Deal's changed. I've been thinking. Does me no good to hand over the DVD and then you and the funky bunch take us out. -x Like you swore to protect and serve? The reference brings Greer up short.       There's a moment, then: And I'll forget a lot, too. But not until they're both out of danger. Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but where's his cellphone? Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show. Your choice, man. The Martins or the DVD. Either way, I'm not hanging around any longer. You got five seconds, then I disconnect your ass. One...     Two... On the other end of the phone: Three...    Four... --but Ryan's got him by the balls.     Angrily, Greer lifts his walkie. Not bad. Most people never get past two. Greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him. Oooh, I think I just pissed myself. Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back door. And just as he's on the brink of success-- Chloe!    Get away from here! It isn't safe to talk, get it? I -- People are after me! Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go! Aw shit... Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, the  Think! Think! Jess... Jessica?     Don't. Jessica trembles with rage, a tear falls. Hey man, your shitty day is about to get a whole lot shittier. Ryan flips open his phone and on the SCREEN plays the SECURITY FOOTAGE of the murder in the parking lot. We see that Ryan must've copied the DVD with his videophone. Ain't that a bitch? And through the tears, Jessica manages a laugh. A small one. But enough to let us know everything's going to be okay. And as we PULL BACK on the scene--  It hurts... But you're making it way better. I'm just glad it's over. And to think this was our first date. I do.  Don't ever call me again. A shared laugh, then as they turn to the television--"
heist,MOORE ,Gene Hackman,"  What makes the world go around? Gold.  It is love.   It is Love of Gold. ...waal, so it takes a little bit of thought... Five is correct.  No wait.  Alright. ...what is it, I'm a doctor... (HE KNEELS AT THE HEAD OF THE FALLEN MAN) Come here, hold his head up. Now... What do you think? I won her in a raffle...  She's got this ""father"" thing.

Ain't that so. Well, what more can you say of anyone? Yeah? ...what? Because he asked them to. Yeah, that's no bargain. Send your cut there...? That I will, Pal. Zat where I'm going? Yeah, I knew you'd show. Yeah, I wouldn't clear my throat, without a backup plan... End of the day, though, end of the day, what's the important thing...? What's the important thing...? You heard.  Come on, get in. C'mon, get in, we'll talk on the road.     You heard about Pinky... Yeah, well, it just went bad there, that little bit. Dinnit...? ...yes, it did... it got kind of convincing.

You said that.  Well.  You must be under quite a lot of stress. It was a pretty plan, though, wunnit...? Thanks for everything. You think so? Well, I missed this trick, though, didn't I...? ...what?"
ghost,SAM ,Patrick Swayze," I told you! I can't breathe.  ""Volga boat..., man."" Whoomph! And about eighty years of dust.  For what? Be great for bumper cars. Hey, look what I found. There's a penny inside.  For luck in our new loft. It's a good omen. It's gonna be great. I hate pitching to these Japanese guys. They make me nervous. I mean, what am I supposed to say, ""Who do you think'll win that big Sumo championship""? ...Molly. Better pay off your Mustang first. So Carl, what did the doctor say? And what about the rash? On your genitals again? Morning Rose. Listen, when the Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore take them right to the... They're early! Noon? Damn! Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in Albany by noon. Can you transfer it to his payroll account? Discretion, huh?  Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf of Market Security Bank & Trust, I welcome you to our city. I'm afraid that's the only Japanese I know. But I realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to Market Security. Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. As you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in New York. (his throat goes dry and he takes a sip of water) But, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace. Excuse me. (he picks up the receiver) Hello? Uh hmm. Okay. Well, that's just fine. Thank you. I'll remember that. Saved your life. Better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street. Here, look out.  I couldn't keep him away. What do you mean? It's comfortable. For T.V. I love that chair. It goes with me. It was the middle of December. I was sitting in my old office, the one Charlie's in. Suddenly, I heard this woman screaming. I thought someone'd been shot or something. She was four thousand dollars over her limit. She's still angry. Get outta here, Frank! (the cat scampers away) You should have seen her. All pink and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous, like a rose. And she's screaming, demanding to see the president. So Wilton brought her to me. She didn't know that. What's a Montana accent?  I wasn't nervous.  I thought you were cute. What are you doing? At 2:00 am?  You notice Carl's eyes today? They were all over you. I feel inspired. The matter? Nothing... really. No. Not really. I don't know. A lot of things. I just don't want the bubble to burst... Whenever something good happens to me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it. What? Ditto. Oh Jesus. Another one. I should cancel my L.A. trip... These things always happen in threes. Yeah. So did they.  Amazing, huh?  Just like that. Blackout. A glitch. What's up? I changed it. Nothing. I just want to nose around a bit... Can you keep your mouth shut? I think I've stumbled onto something. There's too much money in these accounts. That's what I keep asking myself. I've been checking. Not yet. I'm gonna dig around a bit. We're going to the theatre. She wants to see ""Macbeth"" at the Spring Street Repertory. I loved it. Six times. Molly, the ""New York Times"" is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school. Who cares what The New York Times thinks? Your work's beautiful. That's a fact, Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks.  What?  It's just been so long since... I mean, you never wanted to talk about it. What do you think, Moll? What are you talking about? People say ""I love you"" all the time. It doesn't mean anything. Let me handle this. Take the money. Just leave the wallet and my... Molly! No!!!!!!  This isn't happening. It's not happening.  Help me! Do it! Do it! Molly? Molly! Molly! What's happening to me?! Molly!  Molly. Don't stop! I'm not dead! What? Are you talking to me? Who are you? Who are you? What's happening...?  No! Oh God, help me. Molly. I am here, Moll. I am. Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my favorite...  Molly, don't.  Say something. Help her, Carl.  Oh good. That's really good. Molly, we hated that concert. Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll? Hey, Molly! Wait! ""Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry. Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye, and singing this'll be the day that I..."" You motherfucking bastard! What the hell are you doing here? What are you doing? Molly, no! Get out! Damn! Get what? Who the hell are you? What were you doing at Molly's? What the hell's going on?  Stay away from her! Sure lady!  Oh my God... Way to go. Milk her for every penny.  Yeah? Where? What a crock of shit!  Who? What's going on? Who are you talking to? Are you talking to me? I don't believe this. Hey you. My name is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me? Sam Wheat! Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it! Jesus! Go away. Hell no. I'm stayin' right here! Someone else? Are you outta your mind? Not till you help me. I'm standing right beside you. What? Listen, damn it. You can help me. There's a woman, Molly Jensen. She's in terrible danger. The man who killed me broke into our apartment. He's going to go back. You've gotta warn her. She has to! This man's a killer! He's got a key. It's just a phone call. You're all I've got. Lookit. I'm not leavin' till you help me. I don't sleep anymore, so I can sit here day and night. I don't care how long it takes. I can talk forever. You gotta go there. ""I'm Henery the Eighth I am / Henery the Eighth I am, I am / I'm gettin' married to the widow next door / She's been married seven times before / And every one was an Henery / Wouldn't take a Willie or a Sam / I'm her eighth old man I'm Henery / Henery the Eighth I am, I am / Henery the Eighth I am / Second verse same as the first / I'm Henery the Eighth I am..."" Just wait. Just one more time. Please. It's a big place.  ""Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, ninety nine bottles of beer,"" Ask her about the sweater in the closet, the one she knitted that's too big. Four sizes. She couldn't throw it out. I saw. I was there. Tell her she's wrong. I'm holding her hand. I'm holding her hand. God, I love her. I love her so much.  Ditto. Tell her ""ditto"". Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling. I do not have an attitude. Goddamn it, Oda Mae! Relax, Oda Mae. Jesus Christ! Damn it. All right. I apologize.  Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying. You gotta tell her word for word. Molly, you're in danger. Say it! I know the man who killed me. Willie Lopez. I know where he lives. Write it down. You do it! 321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D. Molly, he's got my wallet and my key. He was in here.  You have to go to the police. The Mugger wasn't acting alone. It was a setup, Moll. I was murdered. Where you going? Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it. She needs some support here. Come on, Carl. Open your mind. Give him the address, Moll. Way to go, Carl! You killed me, Carl. You had me killed. Look what you've done to me! Look what you've done! You fucker! You mother fucker! I had a life, Goddamn you. I had a life! Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need you. Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll! You were never our friend. No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him in!  Molly, no. No!!! NO!!! Teach me how you do that! I want to learn! I'm not leaving til you teach me! I don't get it. How do you focus? I'm angry all the time. It doesn't do a thing. I did it! How long have you been here? Someone pushed you? Who? What the hell? What is all this? What's goin' on? Oda Mae. You're doing it. This is for real. How do you like that? Come on. Look at this. You're doing great. I need your help, Oda Mae. There's something we need to do. Give it up? I'm already dead. And how am I supposed to do that? That was incredible, Oda Mae. He spoke through you. It was amazing. You're great, Oda Mae! You're a real medium. It's what you were born for. Oda Mae, what's wrong? Willie! Oda Mae, we're in trouble... I can stop them. But I can't do it alone. You've gotta help me. You're right. And they'll be back. I'm your only chance. I need you Oda Mae. I need you to get some fake ID's. Help me now, they'll never bother you again. I promise. I'll teach you. You'll learn fast. See where it says ""New Accounts""? That's where you're going. Just do what I say. Tell her you're here to fill out a signature card for a new account. Yes. 926-31043. Rita Miller. Tell her Rita Miller. Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you by phone and asked you to come in today. Just sign you name at the bottom on the first blank line.  No, no, no. Rita Miller. Tell her to see that it goes right up to the third floor file since you have a transaction to make. Tell the guard you're here to see Lyle Furgeson. Don't say that! Tell him Rita Miller's here. Don't embellish.  Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a real jerk.  Just be quiet and listen. I've known him five years and he still thinks my name's Paul.  He's a social moron. You don't have to worry about anything. Tell the guard Furgeson knows you. You spent time with him and his wife Shirley at the Brewster's Christmas party last year. This'll be easy. Furgeson was so drunk at that party, he could have had a conversation with Tina Turner and he wouldn't remember. Ask how Bobby and Snooky are. Tell him you've been wondering how they did on the Gibraltar securities. ""We sure did!"" ""Good old Randy"". ""Her"" shoulders. You're closing an account. 926-31043. 31-0-43. Say ""yes""! A cashier's check! Tell him a cashier's check. Sign Rita Miller.  I'll be back in a minute. You're on your own. Don't say anything foolish. Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out of here. Say goodbye. Hurry up, Oda Mae. Oda Mae. Take the check out of your purse. Just do it.  Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller. Do what I say. That's blood money, Oda. I was killed for that money. Endorse it now. We're giving it away. Look to your left. Do what I tell you. Yes, you can. If you don't do it, they'll track you down. Your only protection is to get rid of it, now. I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go to heaven for this. Write ""St. Joseph's Shelter"". I'm proud of you. Come on, we're friends. I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae. Search, you bastard! You'll never find it. It's gone.  They'll kill you for this, Carl. You and Willie. They'll wipe you off the face of the earth. You bastard! You goddamn bastard! It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you have a date with Molly, you creepy son-of-a bitch? Old Carl had a little trouble at the office. He needs to borrow four million dollars. Oh shit! Oda Mae! We're in trouble. They want the check. They're comin' to kill you. We gotta get outta here. It's them. They're heading for the door. No they won't. I'm gonna get 'em. Whataya mean? I'm a ghost, aren't I? He's dead, Oda Mae. No. It's not over, Oda Mae. There's still Carl. Tell him to hurry! Tell her she's wearing the blouse I spilled the Margarita on and the earrings I gave her for Christmas. Gimme a penny quick. Empty your purse. On the floor. Now.  Push a penny under the door.  Tell her it's for luck. I'm sitting beside you. With all my heart. I'd give anything to be alive again, just to feel you once more. No! What's happening to me? Get out of here! The fire escape. Goodbye, Moll.  Molly?! I can't stay anymore.  I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae. (with deep felt gratitude) Thank you. Your mama would be proud. I love you, Molly. I've always loved you. It's so amazing, Moll...  The love inside.  You take it with you."
colombiana,CAT ,Amandla Stenberg," Working on it Mama. I am studying Mama. I want to be a super hero. Are we going to see Uncle Emilio? I'm packed Mama. I don't understand papa. I love you too Papa.  To kill Don Luis! My Papa. Dead. Yes...my passport. Where do I sleep? Very tired. I do. But it's gonna cost you.  Twenty dollars. Twenty dollars a week. How much? Cataleya. Uncle Emilio? I don't know. A long time ago. Whose room is that? Where is he? Killed? By who? I used to want to be like Lara. A super agent.  I want to be a killer. Can you help? Are you trying to scare me? I've already been to school. I told you what I want to be. You don't want to help me, fine. I'll do it myself. But I still want to be a killer. Is that it?  Wearing no panties? Thank goodness. Unbutton your shirt. Now. Not room service. I shouldn't drink. I'm so so sorry. What's going on out there? Really? I probably deserve it. I would have never forgiven myself. We're good. Day after. The morning after OK? Say hello to Mama. Hello Danny. Why? I have a key. I've got nowhere to go. Just what? And then we have the most incredible sex.  Ever. Uh-uh. This taste good enough. No. They put me to sleep. Would you like the key back? Closer? Is this close enough? On my end. You? What do we have?  Not long. No reason. I've got to get ready. Tio. You're removed. You book the work, you collect the fees... I come to you at nine. I say I want to be a killer. What kind of kid makes a career choice like that unless they have something on their mind.  I live for the day that the blood of the son of bitch who did my parents drips in the gutter. Stop playing the innocent with me. You know this. Forever. Why? If you do, you would never have let me get involved in the first place. I love you too. Hi guys. Hey! Hey! OK. OK. Now sit. Now let's see what good boys you can be. Top cut sirloin. Nice, huh? Red, juicy, delicious. Stay. Good boys.  Eat. Hola Pepe. I guess the boys gave me away. I train them. Of course. And the salsa Verde. The long one. Of course. As always. Not this year. I should do a lot of things. Maybe next year. Rewarding. Your ears are better than my eyes. Good idea. Stop right there. Doesn't matter who I am. I want you exactly where you are. You know the thing about sharks. You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers. I'm not going to kill you.  They are. I brought you something. You're making fun. Well, there's that too. You don't want me? What would you like to talk about? You really want to do this?  OK. Nothing much. On vacation. Down south. There was that one. It was OK. Nothing much. A little swimming, fed the fish. Now me what? OK. Want to fuck? Like what? That's a hard one for me. I'm lonely sometimes. Isn't that enough? I shouldn't have done this. Any of it. Because. We already talked. I'm late. I don't like eggs. Now you know something else about me.  Don't come out. Please. Don't. Sorry I'm late. So what? Tio. Could be anyone. You're seeing things that aren't there. How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy's death? How many? And you're going to give me a lecture about revenge? No Mama. One thing at a time. It's me. Are you busy? I was just sitting here, looking out the window. And I thought...where are you? So we're seeing the same sky. And I'm happy to hear yours. ...What picture?  What picture Danny???  Who else saw the picture? Who else?  What does the sister of Ryan have to do with this? Closer. I know. Goodbye Danny. I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry I'd like to speak to the agent in charge of the TAG killings. This won't take long. Hands up. Turn around. Sit. You mean these? Talking about covering all your bases. Your chair is pressure wired. You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore. I know what you're thinking. Maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me. This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things. Like you. He did. This is the last time I was happy. The next day they were dead. He killed them. I didn't know how else to find him. It took you a long time. What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them. And now I want to finish it. Yes you can. He's protected by your government. You're going to have to try harder. I found this on your table inside. Your family, right? Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice. I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years. When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work. You guys ever been to New Orleans? Good morning. I didn't know if you took sugar and cream, so I got one of each. You designed the house at eight seven six Magnolia. I would love to see the plans of this house. Yes, it is. It's Cataleya. For something you can never understand. The love I had for my parents. And you killed that. Actually Don Luis...you are exactly where I want you to be. EAT! Hello Danny. I'm fine. Where are you? That I would come over and we would have amazing sex. Your phone is tapped, you know that? You have forty seconds before they pick up on this. Gives you the time for three questions. ...Cataleya. Twenty seconds. I know where to find you. Last question."
highlander,TAUPIN ,Clancy Brown," I was merely walking by when- Yes. I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after. No. It doesn't. American. What are you getting at? That's none of your business. I presume it's a sword. Your murder weapon? A mystery. Yes.  Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you? It's not mine. Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do. Basil the II. -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please- Good day, Miss Cartwright. Where is he? Where! What name is he using? How many came? And the Bulgarian? He knows I'm here.  How? _Answer_ me. My condolences. Home. He's mistaken. Do you? I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant. Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright? Probably. People like that rarely leave business cards. I don't know what you're talking about. You have an active imagination. Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries. I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright. Your help may be unneccessary. Not so long. You've been here from the start. Of sorts. Run! Run! You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.  Tradition. The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs? His only kid. We were very close. When may I expect the cleaners? Lager and lime. Kahn? Sit.  How are you? How did you find me? What are you doing here? And have you something to settle with me? It's good to see you, Kahn. Neuvich, the clown of the crusades. Offered the Pope one of his whores. Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.  He found us even there. I haven't drunk this much since- You were never a kid. You're insane. How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long? I've had a few more concerns. You're wrong. Finished? Where? At the moment?  Carl Smith. You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time. Not your concern. That bothers you? He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now. You? Have you gone to the police? Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.  You are being foolish. Go home. He sees me as a threat. You shouldn't have come. We're you followed? No one knows you're here? You had to do _nothing_! You're a fool. Come inside. You've been listening to rumors. You are.  Now. There's several bedrooms down the hall.  Take your pick. Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared. Not all of them. I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin. The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in. The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I. Not such a bad trade.  The story of a lifetime for a few days work? Same. No. I'm sure that's true.  Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest. Show you a trick. Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves. My father taught me. Yes, he was.  There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history? I wish I could. It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg. Second thoughts? Yes. They do it each year. Maybe it would do us both good. My father was something of a junk collector. Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then. A little dusty. His son.  Richard. Of sorts. Good evening, Mrs. Butler. My father was never one for social whirls. Nothing to be sorry about. Follow me. Yes. Yes. No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son. More punch? At least. A factor of age. You won't. Why are you here? I see. Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer. You are a very perceptive young woman. Miss Cartwright, it's time I showed you something.  Miss Cartwright? I had this room built some time ago. That would be difficult to explain. I was born Conor MacLeod in the village of Ardvrek on the High- land plain of Strathnaver in the clan of MacLeod under the King of Scotland.  On the eleventh of December, 1408. I have served in the armies of twelve nations, married nine women, fathered thirty-eight children and buried them all. I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on. Yes. He is older than I. Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work. Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance. I didn't kill the watchman. Not the same. Sometimes innocents become involved. There are differences. I haven't killed _you_. No. Come here, Brenna. ""Brenna"".  In Celtic is means ""woman with raven hair"".  Only chieftan's daughters were allowed it. Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both. It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away. All of it finished. Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall. Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to. Good luck. Are you here? And if I refuse? Should I care? Let her go. Leave her out of this. What's the point? What's the point!  You have me, finish it!  Tradition. Go to hell. Leave her alone.  Don't. Stop.  You don't understand. In mamus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum.  Auditorium nostrum in nomine Domine. Requiescant in pace. I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it! The scream of your blood.  The shriek of trees.  Stop it!  Stop it! I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_! Get out. I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God... _Get out_! The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed? Not power.  Not control. Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life. Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna. It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime? It's taken me so long.  So very long."
pleasantville,DAVID ,Tobey Maguire,"  ""It might be ...""  ""Right behind you father.""  What's a mother to do? Hi. I mean ...  ... Hi. Look. You probably don't think I should be asking you this. I mean--not knowing you well and all ...  I mean I know you--everybody knows you ... I just don't know you ... technically. Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see you all the time in Algebra and I heard you humming that Van Halen song and I really like that song too ...  Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing this weekend but my Mom's leaving town and she said I could use her car so ... Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have? Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter? Marmalade. Okay--here's one: Why did their parents come home early from their weekend at the lake? 'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and they were worried about him. Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon. Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon. ... He's not homeless Howard, they just don't say where he lives.  Well it's a silly question.  Because nobody's homeless in Pleasantville. ... because that's just not what it's like. Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty. I gotta go. What are you doing? Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.  Yeah. Every episode ever. Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.  Oh my God ... (sinking to his knees/ scooping up the remains) Oh my God ... No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote. Yeah ... Sort of ...  You know, we didn't call any TV repair.  The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.  ... Her father.  ... Like Prince Charming. Yeah ... McIntire's. No. McIntire's. Remember:  ""For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."" Ooomph?  How much does it cost? Hunh.  Great. No way. Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.  Get lost!  Oh my God. I'm not sure. I don't know.  What the hell's going on! We're in Pleasantville? You--you gotta get us out of here. Because we don't belong! My name's David. Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now. Don't get upset. Where are you going ... WAIT A MINUTE!! COME BACK!!!  Oh God. I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible? It can't be possible.  I don't believe this. Just take deep breaths. We're supposed to be in school. Hello Mr. Simpson. Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell. Owns the hardware store. We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ... Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue. We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back. To who? Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team. As a matter of fact he does. Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean. I don't think so. Wow. Oh God! Are we in that episode? I don't believe it. You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...  Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ... What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little ""different"" lately ... I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...  Look, I'm sure we'll work something out. I'll talk to her or something. Honest. It'll be fine. One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack. What? What were you doing in a library? JENNIFER! Jen, listen ...  I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. It's in your closet. He won't notice anyway. They don't notice that kind of thing. Jen please ... Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work. Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ... What's wrong?  Yeah ... I'm sorry.  You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet. I understand.  Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders of fries and a split?  What? Listen to me! Do you have the lettuce? Have you cooked the burgers? Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along. Really. It's fine. What can I get you two?  Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there. NOOOOOO! YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EXIST!  Thanks a lot. Have you seen Mary Sue?  No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.  Oh no ... I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh hi! Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early. Yeah ... Yeah ...  Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ... really appreciate it.  What did you do to him? What do you mean ""nothing?"" That's not nothing. That's ...  Oh no ... Oh my God ... You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you. You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE. You have no right to do this. They're happy like this. I just don't think we have the right to ... They don't have that kind of potential. What'll it be?  Really? It seems so fattening. Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.  Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ... C'mere. What did you say? What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point! Just listen to me ... Forget about that! Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.  So they can have their hamburgers!  ... What's that?  Wow ... That's pretty good ... I think you should try not to think about this anymore. Yeah. Oh my God! Jesus Christ ... FIRE! FIRE!  FIRE ... FIRE ...  CAT!!! Right here! Here! Grab this nozzle. Just grab it!  Okay! Now point this right at the flames--like this. Oh. Thanks, Margaret.  Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey. No. You baked them for Whitey. Um ... thanks.  It's okay. It's fine. Sure. How you doin? What? Well--where I used to live ... That's just what firemen did.  Um ... Outside of Pleasantville. Look it doesn't matter. It's not important. It's really not important.  Well ... There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on going. Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ... ... What?  I thought the books were blank? The pages filled in?  Well, yeah ... I do. Well--see ... they're both running away--Huck and the slave ... And ... They go up the river ... But--in trying to get free they sort of see that they're free already.  Oh my God. Hunh?  Oh yeah ... Well this is great.  See--Holden Caulfield is like this really lonely kid... I'll get her.  Are you okay? Are you alright? It's okay. It's alright. Have you got any make up? Okay--first we'll dry you out a little. Looks just like it did.  No ... They won't be able to tell. Wait. It's fine.  Sure.  Hi.  I brought you something ... From the library. It's an art book. Open it. I just thought since you liked painting it might help to ... What's wrong? Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ... Hi.  Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ... It's just that my folks are gonna stay home and they said I could use their car. (moment of truth/ abandoning his speech) ... You want to go out with me tonight?  ... Lover's Lane?  Sorry ... ""Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching in ...""  ... Hi.  I can't. Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ... Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my ""dad"" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ... Re-runs? Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just ""cookies"" after all ... Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow? Terrific. I'll talk to you then. Nothing. Listen ... You're reading?  ... Yeah.  That's great. Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question? Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me? Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up. You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me? Wow. Yes.  What? Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ... Oh ... Right. Wow. What's that smell?  Mmmmgh. Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know. What? Oh. don't know ... It's different. Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ... Yeah. Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue. Hunh?  They just grow like that? Rain. Yeah ... You don't have rain either? Right. Of course you don't ...  We'll just put up the top. It's fine. Come on. It's alright. There's nothing to be afraid of.  I got you something. It was a prop for the school play ... Sure ...  Hello Whitey.  No reason. (pause/ firing back) How come you're not? Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here. It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.  Oh--well ...  What do you mean? Look--it just sort of ""happened"" ... I had nothing to do with that. Look ...  ... Only if they mean it.  I didn't do anything wrong. Why? No you're not.  I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.  I'm going to leave now.  Come on! COME ON! Get out of here! Are you alright?  What?  Come on. Oh my God. Are you alright? Are you okay? We should be okay up here.  We better go. I'm not sure. Oh my God.  It's okay. It's me. Let's go inside. Hello? Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn these booths back up. ""Mary Sue"", why don't you help me slide this in front of the door. We'll be okay in here.  ""THREE: The area commonly known as Lover's Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until further notice."" ""FOUR: The only permissible recorded music shall be the following: Pat Boone, Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones, The marches of John Phillips Souza or the Star Spangled Banner. In no event shall any music be tolerated that is not of a temperate or ""pleasant"" nature."" ""FIVE: There shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind."" ""SIX: No bedframe or mattress may be sold measuring more than 38 inches wide.""  ""SEVEN: The only permissible exterior paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or GRAY, despite the recent availability of certain alternatives."" ""EIGHT: All elementary and high school curriculums shall teach the ""non-changist"" view of history-- emphasizing ""continuity"" over ""alteration.""  Wow. Sure you are.  Stick together till you get off Main Street. It's okay. We'll get you a new one. Maybe I have an idea.  Yes I did.  Yes I do. Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want. Still doesn't make it right.  C'mere, Dan. I'll help you. I thought it might be you. I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors. Why?  Why don't you just take me back without it? So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ... I'm sorry. I can't do that. They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.  I don't know ... Three, four weeks. I'm going on trial tomorrow?  There's worse places. Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer? Well--it was dark out ... It was accessible to everyone. I think I've got something to say. I think I know why you're doing this. I mean, I understand why you're doing this. I used to feel the same way. I used to want this place to stay just the way it was. I never wanted it to change ...  But nothing stays the same. You get things, and you lose things, and that's the good part and the bad part--but you can't have a good part without a bad part. It's like the basketball team. Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win. Wouldn't it feel better than when they used to win all the time? See, I know you want it to stay ""Pleasant"" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ... I thought I was allowed to defend myself. I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you. Mr. Simpson ... What color is that hedge of yours? No, not that hedge. The other one. The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare. What color is that hedge? Alright. Dad ...  Don't you miss her? I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ...  Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it ""love.""  Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her? Don't you wish you could tell her that? Why am I out of order? Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either. But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you. Oh sure it is.  What do you want to do to me right now? C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ... But it could happen. Are you sure? This thing works. We could go home right now.  Honestly ... no. You got the admissions letter. And you're sure about this? I'll come back and check on you in a month. No I won't. I swear. I like it too. You're gonna keep painting aren't you? Well ... It's beautiful. Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ... I won't.  ... It's a pretty short trip. Thanks ... I love you. You better stand back a little."
pi,MAX ,Sean Gullete," The alchemist awakes.  ""Turn lead into gold, Max, lead into gold."" Today, I find it. Heat's been getting to Euclid. Feel it most in the afternoon when I run the set. Have to keep the fans on all night from now on. Otherwise, everything is running topnotch. The stack of 286's is now faster than Columbia's computer science department. I spent a couple hundred dollars. Columbia's cost? Half a million?  Ha... Oh, no.  One hundred fifty-eight thousand, a hundred two. Right?  Three point three one eight one eight one eight... Somewhere in there. Somewhere. I know it's right in front of me. The pattern. They say it's chaos, it can't be understood, too much complexity. History it's there. Lurking, shaping. structuring, hiding, right beneath the surface. The cycling of disease epidemics, the wax and wane of Caribou populations in the Arctic, sunspot cycles, the rise and fall of the Nile and yes! the New York Stock Exchange, they are all the same. I'll find this structure, this order, this perfection. Turn lead into gold. The first. Right here. Right here. With math. The numbers of the stock market are my lead. When I find the pattern, then I will find gold. Hello? Yeah? Who's this? I told you... Sorry, I can't. I can't. I don't take offers for my research. You know that. Sorry, I Couldn't help you. Hi, Devi. What are you doing? I have to go. Thanks. Sixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid shows tomorrow's Dow closing up by four points. Anomalies include PRONET at sixty-fire and a quarter, a career high. Possible explanations, either A, an error in the June fifth algorithm, or B, Euclid's main processor is running a recursion... Max. Max Cohen. No, I'm not interested in religion. No. I'm sorry, I'm very busy.  Really? I gotta go... I'm sorry, bye. Please God, Let it be a small one. Sixteen thirty-five. Second headache in under twenty-four hours. They're getting more frequent now...more painful, too. Drugs don't work, just take the edge off of it. Just gotta wait for the nosebleed. Relief comes from my nose. Ahh... Leave me alone. No! No!  Who is... My house...how do... Damn. I didn't get to it. I'm so close, Sol. I'm so close but I just can't grab it. We'll see. You found things... Tuesday, September second, eighteen twelve. If Sol hadn't gotten sick who knows where math would be. He spent years in the numbers of Pi. Searching for meaning, for order. Three point one four...off into infinity and maybe insanity. Somewhere in there he wanted sanity. Sanity like he found in the circles Pi represented. Simple, sane circles. If only the stock market had circles. Some type of sanity. Some type of form, of shape. Oh, okay. Um, I work with computers ...math. Number theory. Mostly research.  Yeah... Hm.  Kind of interesting. They're Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence. Italian mathematician, thirteenth century. If you divide a hundred and forty-four into two hundred and thirty-three, it approaches theta. The Greek symbol for the golden ratio. The golden spiral. Wherever there's spirals. Math everywhere...  Everywhere... Oh my God... Simple shapes! Tuesday, September second. Twenty-twenty-two. Sol! Sol! Sol! Shapes in the market. Why not? And they're spirals! Spirals! A circle spread out overtime. It's open-ended. It has a beginning and it grows and changes through time. If I can find where it fits, if I can spin it and lock it into a group of numbers, then I can calculate the future. Lead into gold. Chaos into order Madness into sanity. Pain into bliss. Perfection. What the... Shit! What the... Wednesday, September third, seven-fifteen. Results: AAR at fourteen and a halflow, very low. ABR at six and a halfjeez. Six and a half, ABR hasn't been beneath twenty in ten years. Conclusion: Simple. There is no pattern. No pattern. Chaos, chaos, all chaos. Euclid crashed. I lost all my data, my hardware. Burnt... I don't know, first I got these horrible picks. Then Euclid spits out some numbers. Never saw anything like it and then it fries. The whole machine just crashed. Of? I threw it out. I don't know, just a long string of digits. I don't know. I don't know. Probably around two hundred.  Why? Yeah. That a breakthrough will come... Hey, excuse me, can I see that? Six and a half. Fourteen and a half. Oh, my...  My God. My God.  Yes! Yes! Who are you? I'm sorry, I don't... No, no, no, really, I can't. On the nose. On the damn nose. Um, no, it's Max from next door. Do you have any iodine?  No. I just need it to stain a slide. Just something with my computer. I just threw out something. I didn't realize I needed it. Just a printout. I, uh, lost my data... You gotta car? All tight, lets go. Lenny, I don't really want to do... You know me? I have? What kind of pattern? What sort of number?  Two sixteen? What is it?  No, I mean the number, the two sixteen number? What is it? Tell me more. What's going on, Sol!? What's the two hundred and sixteen number, Sol? You asked me if I had seen a two hundred and sixteen digit number, right? What do you mean by ""found it""? Well, there's these religious Jews who have... Well, you know, Hassidim. I met one in the coffee shop. The guy's a number theorist. The Torah is their data set. The thing is, they're searching for a two hundred and sixteen digit number in the Torah. They say they don't know, but that's crazy. I mean what are the odds... But hold on, there's something else. You remember those strange picks I got. Right. Well, it turns out that they were correct. I hit two picks on the nose. Smack on the nose. Something's going on, and it has to do with that number. The answer is there. No. it's a pattern. A pattern is in that number But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable. So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order...a pattern, beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number. Or maybe it's genius. I have to get that number. Damn it already! Stop following me. I'm not interested in your money. I'm searching for a way to understand our world. I'm searching for perfection. I don't deal with mediocre materialistic people like you!  Go.  I'm not interested. I told you I don't want money.  Ming Mecca. They're not declassified.  What do...do... Yeah, I got to go. Let me think about it... Hey! Jenna. I can't now, Jenna. I'm working now, later okay? Lenny, it's Max Cohen. I want to help. Do you have the Torah in digital form? Thursday, September fourth, sixteen forty-five. The alchemist awakes. All of my ideas, work and dreams are spinning together It all has to do with spirals. It began with spirals and the answers are thee. The most I can remember about their significance is from Schneider's class. That bullshit core for majors. Schneider's fascination with mystical geometry made him a bit of a quack...but...then again, look at Kepler. He was really into Pythagoras. The leader of an ancient sect which believed the entire universe could be represented by numbers. Pythagoras' greatest contribution was the golden ratio, which ended up influencing art and science for thousands of years, arguably all the way up to today. The golden ratio, if I recall, is this unique relationship between the length and width of a special rectangle called the golden rectangle. If you take the width of this rectangle and use it to form a square within the rectangle, the part left over is a rectangle that has the same ratio as the original rectangle. au can continue squaring the rectangle, over and over again, making the rectangles smaller and smaller to infinity. Then, if you connect a curve through these rectangles you get the golden spiral. The Pythagoreans loved this shape because they found it everywhere in nature. It really is amazing. In the sea, on land, in air, our basic building block DNA and even our home. If we're built from spirals, while living within a giant spiral, is it possible that all of human behavior, if it could be quantified, is in the form of a spiral. Then, maybe, extensions of our behavior like the stock market. maybe even the writing of The Torah, is infused with the spiral pattern. Friday, September fifth. Seven twelve. It's fair to say, I'm stepping out onto a limb. But I'm on the edge and that's where it happens. Marcy Dawson. Max Cohen. Look what do you want for the chip? No, I don't. I don't know if I'll find anything useful. Okay. First, I want you to call off the surveillance. MARCY DAWSON  Done. Anything else? Yeah, I'm a very private person. Knock on my door and leave the suitcase outside. I don't want to talk to Anyone. I'll knock back. What is it? No, what is it? The two hundred and sixteen digits. If the number's in there, I'll find it. Wha... No, no.. No, no, I just. It's that she's your girl... No, no, sir, please. I've never touched Devi...I never will.  Okay. Friday, September fifth? Lots of work to be done. But I'm close, so close. Today is the day Might have cost me my soul, but down the line I'll work it out. Just keep them in the dark, let them beg. A damn Ming Mecca chip. It's like giving a desperate junkie a syringe filled with junk. Defense uses them to nun nuclear sub reactors. Me? I'm going to dissect the market. Happy birthday, Euclid. Eighteen thirty. Press return... Max darts over and smacks the RETURN. Moments later we see what Max sees Oh God. Damn religious freaks.  The holy Torah... Ah God... Too much...too soon. Ohh... Stop, please, stop. What the? What is it!? What is it!? Two...two hundred. That's it! That's it! Oh... What happened?  The number, the number. Four...zero... seven...It's in my head, it's in my head. Somehow I memorized it. I got it up here! But what is it? 0ut, out, you have to get out. Get out, get out it's my room! Out! 0utt Out! Get out! Saturday? Dark outside. There was a moment there...when, I don't know...when I didn't exist. What? What? Must be an explanation, must be a reason. Must. Bastard. Two and a quarter, twelve and an eighth, six and two eighths. I know these...Seven and a quarter. Two and a half ...oh...oh... My God. It's gonna crash, it's gonna fucking crash. You lied to me. You found the two sixteen number in Pi, didn't you? You saw it. I saw it, Sol. I don't know what happened, but I know things. The market is going to crash. It's going to crash. It hasn't yet, but I know it will. I saw it, Sol. What is it, Sol? What's the number? It's in my head! The computer becomes conscious?  Studying the pattern made Euclid conscious of itself. Before it died it spit out the number That consciousness is the number. Stop? How can I stop? I'm this close. What are you saying?  You were afraid of it. That's why you quit. C'mon, Sol. That's bullshit. It's math, numbers, ideas. Mathematicians are suppose to be out on the edge. You taught me that! That's where discoveries happen. We have to go out there alone, all alone, no one can accompany us. We have to search the edge. We have to risk it all. But you ran from it. You're a coward. You can't tell me what it is. You don't know You've retreated to your goldfish, to your books, to your Go, but you're not satisfied. I want to understand it. I want to know! Who are you working for? I don't want your wallet. Who sent you? Who the hell sent you!? Who are you?! Leave me alone, damn it. Leave me alone. Marcy? What's up? I can't, I got work... Don't ever hit... Leave me alone. I don't know anything. Hey! Hey! Hey! I didn't do anything. I didn't play the market. How could you do that? You selfish, irresponsible cretins. How could you be so stupid!? C'mon! I know who you are. You're not gonna save the world. My God, what are you doing? You can't kill me! You bastards! You stupid bastards!  Farrouhk!  C'mon... Farrouhk what about Farrouhk!? Go back! What's going on? What's going on? Yeah, I have it! What is it? What are you doing!? What the hell are you doing!?  It's not on me. It's in my head. Who? Why do you care? Screw you! They've got part of it Now get off me! Using what? Let go! Yeah, yeah What is it? You wouldn't be so flipped out if you didn't know. What's happening to me? Screw you! What are you... So? Yeah...  You're telling me that the number in my head is the name of God!? That's what happened. I saw God. It's more than God... it s everything. It's math and science and nature... the universe. I saw the Universe's DNA I saw everything. Garden? You're not pure. I'm the one who has the number It was given to me. It's part of me. It's changing me. And what will it do to you? The number is nothing. You know that! It's just a number. I'm sure you've written down every two hundred sixteen number. You've translated all of them. You've intoned them all. Haven't you? But what's it gotten you? It's not the number! It's the meaning. It's the syntax. It's what's between the numbers. If you could understand you would. But it's not for you! I've got it. I understand it. I'm going to see it!  Rabbi...I was chosen. Suddenly, it's all there. It all makes sense. I can crack it. I can know it. I know what it is. Sol knows, too. I need to tell him. I need to show him. I need to bring him with me.  Sol? What do you mean? Where is he? No. Stop it, please!  No. No. I'm ready. I'm ready! Show me! Three, seven, two... Where am I? What is this? This is wrong, Sol. Sol! Sol! You were right Sol! He was right. He was right. I want to breathe. Breathe.  I don't know. I really don't know. What is it, Jenna? Oh."
invictus,MANDELA ,Morgan Freeman,"  Morning boys. How are you? Good ... good. And how's your mother doing, Linga? Good. It says, ""He can win an election, but can he run a country?"" It's a legitimate question. Good morning everybody. Barbara, good morning. You've had your hair done. I like it. Give me one moment, please. BARBARA -- -- please assemble the staff for me. Whoever has not already left. Yes, please. I'd like you to stay out here, please. I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding behind men with guns.  Gooie more almal. Some of you may know who I am. Good morning ... how are you ... thank you for coming at such short notice ... etc. I couldn't help noticing the empty offices as I came to work today. And all the packing boxes. Now, of course, if you want to leave, that is your right. And if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away. But if you are packing up because you fear that your language, or the color of your skin, or who you served previously, disqualifies you from working here now, I am here to tell you, have no such fear.  Wat is verby is verby. What's past is past. We look to the future, now. We need your help. We want your help. If you would like to stay, you will be doing your country a great service. I ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities, and with good hearts. I promise to do the same.  If we can manage that, our country will be a shining light in the world. You look agitated, Jason. What have you done? Yes. They've had special training, those boys -- with the SAS. And lots of experience. They protected De Klerk. You asked for more men, didn't you? In public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too. You represent me, directly. The rainbow nation starts here.  Reconciliation starts here. Yes, I know.  Forgiveness starts here, too. Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear. That is why it is such a powerful weapon, Jason.  Please try it. Only what is necessary. Good luck, captain. Thank you for honoring our new flag! Oh, yes, of course. Shall we work while we watch? We have lots of promises to keep. It's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game. Where the money is. America, England, Saudi Arabia. It's also a constitutional right. Look at that. The whites are cheering for the Springboks, the blacks are cheering for the Lions. We did that on the island, you know. We supported anyone but the `boks. It really irritated the warders. How long until the World Cup? Plenty of time for improvement. I want to go to India and Indonesia, too. Very badly. Why? You're too good to me. Did she say why? No, thank you. I'm going to bed. Good night. I delegate that decision to you. No. No. Your advice is duly noted, Barbara. Yes, I know. But in this instance the people are wrong. And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that. Can you tell the boys that Madiba wants to go to Eersterust, very fast. The day I am afraid to do that is the day I am no longer fit to lead. Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am here because I feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight. I am aware of your earlier vote. I am aware that it was unanimous.  Nonetheless, I propose that we restore the Springboks. Restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately. Let me tell you why ... ... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison, my jailers were all Afrikaners.  For twenty seven years, I studied them. I learned their language, I read their history, I read their poetry. I had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him.  And we prevailed, did we not? All of us here ... we prevailed. Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner. They are our fellow South Africans, our partners in democracy. And they treasure Springbok rugby. If we take that away, we lose them. We prove that we are what they feared we would be.  We have to be better than that. We have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity. Yes, I know. All the things they denied us. But this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. This is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold.  You elected me.  You elected me to be your leader. Let me lead you now.  Who is with me on this? Who is with me? Well, as you know, I am an obedient party member. But, I must. This minority still controls the army, the police, and the economy. Without them, we cannot address the other problems. It's a human calculation.  If we take away what they cherish -- the Springboks, their national anthem -- we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us. I will do what I must to break this cycle. Or it will destroy us. The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again. I have come here with a message. People of the Unites States of America: Open your markets to us. People of the United States of American: Come and invest in our country. I'm fine. Travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring. This is for you. Morning boys. How is your family, Hendrick? I have a very big family. 42 million people. I don't think I want to walk today. Hello Barbara. I like that dress.  What is it? This is terrible. Francois, what an honor. I'm so excited. Thank you for coming all this way to see me. Tell me. How's your ankle? I was told you'd hurt it. Has it healed? Yes ... yes. In sports, and in life. Come. Sit. Please.  Take this one. Looking into the light hurts my eyes. Ah, Mrs. Brits -- -- you are a shining light in my day. Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar. He's the captain of the Springboks. No thank you, I think I'd like to. How do you take your tea, Francois? The English have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest. You have a very difficult job. Captain of the Springboks. A very difficult job. Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I'm doing mine. It is not so difficult to get people to do their best. And I imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically. Yes. But to get people to be better than that? Better than they think they can be? Now, that is difficult, I find. How do we do that? By example? To an extent. But there is more to it than that ... (searching for the right WORD) ... inspiration, perhaps. How do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? How do we inspire everyone around us?  Sometimes, I think, by using the work of others. On Robben Island, when things were very hard, I found inspiration in a poem. A Victorian poem. Just words. But they helped me to stand when all I wanted was to lie down --  But you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense. Yes ... yes. Everybody is preparing. Yes! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The whole stadium welcomed me with a song.  At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be South African. It helped me to come home and do better. It allowed me to expect more of myself. Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. A very inspiring song. We need inspiration, Francois. Because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations. Excuse me. What do you think? Yes, it does. You criticize without understanding. You seek only to address your own feelings. This is selfish thinking. It does not serve the nation. Wait. Please. I -- Will you give this to your mother. A bracelet. I don't have the right to. It's not mine. The Ivory Coast qualified. This is wonderful. According to the experts, you and I are still supposed to be in jail. A billion people watching us! (wheels turning in his HEAD) Yes ... yes. This is a great opportunity.  Please call the head of South African rugby for me. Please call President Clinton for me. I wish to offer him our condolences. Do you see why forgiveness is essential, Jason?  Revenge only begets revenge. Mr. Minister, please forgive me. This sounds excellent, and we will return to it, but if you'll indulge me for just one minute -- You see, that picture is worth any number of speeches. Around the world -- objectively -- what are they saying about our chances against Australia? So it is very important that we beat Australia.  Thank you. I'll be right out. Barbara, I have been studying. No. Not exactly. Test me. Block out the names. See if I can recognize them. Andre Joubert. Gavin Johnson.  Did I get them right?  This is how I used to study in law school.  Unfortunately, Chester is far too easy to identify. But that will change. It must. People do not realize that I once played rugby myself, when I was a student at Fort Hare. It is a very rough game. Almost as rough as politics. I think they will do very well. Their level of commitment is tremendous. Obviously, that is no longer true. I am one hundred percent behind our boys. After all, if I cannot change when circumstances demand it, how can I ask others to? Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match ...  ... I just wanted to wish you good luck, in person. And sometimes, very seldom, as President, I am allowed to do what I want. I know who this is.  Good luck, Andre. (shaking hands with all of THEM) Good luck Brendan, we're behind you all. Japie -- etc But where is Chester? Is he out for the whole tournament? The whole country will miss him. Yes, Hennie. I am honored. Truly honored. Good luck gentlemen. Your country supports you, completely. Francois, walk with me. I have something for you. This helped me, many times. Perhaps it will help you, too. I think I'll stay up a little longer. The country is excited tonight. The doctor has no sense of occasion. What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you? Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. As you know, I am not.  But when I look at you ... I envy my father.  Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbow'd. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishment the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul. I know who this is. Welcome, and thank you for coming such a long way to see me. Please excuse me for a moment. This is very good ... very good! Who is our opponent? Please make sure that my schedule is clear for the entire match. Let's do some work while we watch. Are those the judicial appointments for the Free State? Come and look at this. Do you still think I'm wasting my time with the rugby? Barbara, can you please tell the Minister of Sport that I need a detailed briefing on the All Blacks. Oh yes. Of course. 145 points, in one match? 45 to 29. And it was not that close.  They seem unstoppable. Their Maori war dance. Yes. It's very powerful. How are we going to beat them? No ... no. I don't want to break their focus for even a minute.  But, how do we win? ON LINGA: an idea occurs to him. A wild idea. He almost turns and blurts it out -- restrains himself. It's not enough. Not now. Not so close.  This country is hungry for greatness. Can a man not sleep in, when he has a big day ahead of him? Morning, boys. What is it? I'm so glad you're here. Hello, Jonah.  Perhaps we should make a small wager? I was thinking more along the lines of a case of wine. How long before the end? Francois, I want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country. Tell Jason it's all right. There's no hurry."
cars_2,MATER ,Larry Guy the Cable,"Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is here to help you! Hey, Otis! Well dadgum, you're leaking oil again. Must be your gaskets. Hey, look on the bright side: This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house. Don't sweat it. These things happen to everybody, Otis. Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through. Not yet. Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him. But I sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and -- --- McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen, welcome back! You too, buddy. Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe the things I got planned for us.  You ready to have some serious fun? Wow. I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson. Well, Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure. You sure you can handle it? Just remember, your brakes ain't gonna work on these! Relax, these train tracks ain't been used in years! This is gonna be good! Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good. Boy, this was the best day ever! And my favorite souvenir? This new dent! Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til you see what I got planned for tonight. That's exactly what I was thinking. Even better! You, me and Miss Sally going out for supper. Oh.  Okay. Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have fun now. Good evening. My name is Mater and I'll be your waiter.  Mater the waiter. That's funny right there. Well yeah I work here. What'd you think, I just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter, just so I could hang out with you? Now, can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks? Uh, right. Your usual. CUT TO: Guido! What's McQueen's usual? Perfect! Give me two of `em.  What happened to the dinosaurs, now? Yeah, that Italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world. Cause he knows what's important. Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life. That ain't what I meant. CUT TO: Well let me tell you something else there, Mr. San Francisco --- McQueen could drive circles around you. No! I mean yes. I mean he could beat you anywhere, anytime, any track. Ha ha! That shows what you know. Dump trucks is dumb. Your drinks, sir. I didn't taste it! You mean it? You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that? Hey! You done good! You got all the leaves! You're just realizing that? Boy, that jet-lag really done a number on you. Different than what? You need help? Shoot, why didn't you just say so? That's what a tow truck does. Hey, looky there, it's Mr. San Francisco! I'll introduce you.  Look at me -- I'm helping you already! Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet ---  Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you? Miss Sally is gonna flip when she sees this. She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend. She's a big fan of yours. You're right. She's a huge fan. She goes on and on about your open wheels here. I'll go get you one. You mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks? Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing here? I'll take one of them. Never know which one McQueen'll have a hankering for. Hey, what you got here that's free? How about that pistachio ice cream? Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up with you? That looks delicious. Uh, a little more, please. It is free, right?  Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go, it's free! You're getting there... Scoop scoop! There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of ice cream. Somebody get me water!  Sweet relief...  Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream. It has turned! No, thank you. This trip's been amazing. But wait, I... oh, shoot. But I never leak oil. Never. Coming through! Excuse me, leakin' oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. I gotta go!  What the... Sorry ladies! I never leak I never leak I never leak... Wowee... What in the---  Hey, that tickles.  Whatever you do, I would not go in there. A Gremlin and a Pacer!  No offense to your makes and models, but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the ---  --- altar! Are you okay? Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the way of your ""private business."" Oh! A little advice: When you hear her giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button. It's to adjust the temperature. Remember it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit. Alright then. Excuse me, ma'am.  Dadgum pistachio ice cream.  Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin' to get funky! Well, hello. Well of course it doesn't. That's `cause it's air-cooled! Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with the pancake motors... ... And before both of them, there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore's one of them. Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a little, uh --- Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races. What's a rendezvous? A date?! Well, what's going on is I've got me a date tomorrow. Well, believe it. My new girlfriend just said so. Hey, there she is.  Hey! Hey lady! See ya tomorrow! And he's awesome! CUT TO: McQueen! It's time to make your move. Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you. Wow! Some of them fellers is really loud. Uh, what? Hey, I know you. You're that girl from the party last night. You wanna do our date right now? Is there gonna be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race? Well, all right but I usually like to have a proper detailing done before I meet a lady friend. Hey, new lady friend? You like flowers? Stay outside. Gotcha. What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus? Wow! A live karate demonstration! That was cool! Hey, can I get your autograph? Hey, where'd he go? Dadgum, did I miss our date? Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right? Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's funny right there. Nah, see that's `cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of them even had a flamethrower --- Going to meet my date. She started talking to me as a voice in my head, telling me where to go --- Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you up, did I? Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean --- Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to somebody and explained what happened I could help. But I'm gonna miss my plane. Doggone it. This is about my hook, isn't it? I know I should've checked it, but I can't really, look -- it's attached to me. Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration. Tow Mater. Average intelligence. Let's just say I'm triple-A affiliated. You know, I know some karate. I don't wanna brag or nothing, but I've got me a black fan belt. Hey, you wanna see some moves I made up? This first one I can reach into a car's hood, pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls. I call it, ""What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once.""  Look, I probably ought to go. I'm about to miss my flight. This is First Class service. You don't even have to go through the terminal.  Your karate partners are back here. They kinda look like they're trying to catch up!  Is everything okay back there?  You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what? I knew I should've done carry-on! Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary girlfriend!  Boy I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? That's a no-quit attitude right there. By the time you read this, I will be safely on an airplane, flying home. That's the closest I ever been to missing my flight! That was ---  Yow! I gotta go to a doctor. I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage. Hey, lemme introduce you two.  This here is Finn McSomething-or- other. He's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit. And Finn, this here's my date.  I never did get your name.  It's Shiftwell. Holley --- Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches... Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it? Agent? You mean like insurance agent, like,  `Like a good neighbor, Mater is there'? Wait, you mean secret agents. You guys is spies! You're pretty. And so nice. You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by. Wait, what? Well yeah I live right next to one.  I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently. Well, okay. But you know I'm just a tow truck, right? Yeah, two of them sweets for me too, Sid!  You know, I always wanted to be a spy. Yeah, Finn? Shopping? What do you mean? Why would I --- Dadgum. You gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here. Look at them hoods! I could use a hood. Sorry fellers, I gotta go. Excuse me. What are you selling? Man, there are some great --- Hey, wait for me! Sure thing. CUT TO: Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't nothing truer than that. Yeah, you know. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport. Is the Popemobile Catholic? That's where the next race is! Boy, I'll tell you what. That three- wheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting. You never see this many lemons in one town. Unless there's a swap meet, or something. Hey, how'd you get all them pictures? Wow, not only is you the prettiest car I ever met, but you the smartest too. That's a familiar sight. A Hugo being towed. But he looks absolutely perfect. Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day, I'd hire me to tow me around all the time too. What? Ahh! Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now. What? I thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise. Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a German truck! Check it out. I'm wearing Materhosen. Make me a monster truck!  I vant to siphon your gas. Now make me a taco truck! A funny car! So I just go in, pretend to be this truck. Hey, what are you doing? Oh. For a second there I thought you was trying to fix my dents. Well then no thank you. I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody. They're way too valuable. I come by each one of them with my best friend Lightning McQueen. I don't fix these. I want to remember these dents forever. But my line of work is towing and salvage. No, I meant for real. I --- I don't know about this, Finn. What if I screw things up? It's just that them guys look pretty tough and --- Wait, did you say ""idiot""? Is that how you see me? I, uh--- Okay, okay. Computer: disguise.  Wow, this place looks like it's made out of gold. Why is that? What do you mean don't talk to you? (more talking from Holley which we cannot hear) So you want me to stop talking to you. Right now? I have no idea what you're talking about... ...Alexander Hugo, aka ""Chop Shop Alex."" Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex. But I guess that makes sense seeings how you's wanted in France, Germany, the Czech Republic... Oh yeah, it's unbelievable. Uh, of course I ain't leavin'. McQueen? No! Dadgum. Shoot. I didn't mean --- Whoa!! Wait wait! I didn't mean that kind of shoot! McQueen! Lemme through! Lemme through!  You gotta let me in! I gotta get through to warn McQueen! No, listen! I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this Lemonhead meeting and my weapons system misinterperated what I was SAYING --- McQueen! McQueen!  McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen, they're gonna kill you!! Let me go! Idiot? Is that how you see me? Domo arigato! You done good! You got all the leaves! Now that's a scoop of ice cream! I never leak oil. Never. Wait a minute. I didn't screw you up, did I? Maybe if I talked to somebody, or--- Bang a gong, get it on! Holley! Finn! Where are we? Woaaaah! --- This... this is all my fault. But I am, remember? You said so. I'm not a spy! I've been trying to tell you that the whole time. I really am just a tow truck. You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is `cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault.  He's still alive? Backup plan?? Dadgum lemons. Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum! DADGUMDADGUMDADGUMDADGUM --- I gotta get you all out of there! But I can't, I'm just a tow truck. What about you guys? What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?! Everybody get out! Get out now! Y'all gotta get out the pits! Hey, what are you guys doing here? No! Everything's not okay! There's a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get out! Now! Finn! You're okay! Uh-oh. Stop right there! Don't come any closer! No, I'm not okay. Stay away from me!! Stay back! If you get close to me, you gonna get hurt real bad! McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the bomb! Stay away!  Gotta keep away from McQueen. McQueen, let go! No way! You could get hurt! Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan. Deactivate! Deactivate!  Fellers, listen. I know what you're going through. Everybody's been laughing at me my whole life too --- --- but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better. I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done. What? No, I can't do it. Look, nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs. Thanks, buddy. Oh, right! Hang on! Computer! I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen! Now I need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first! Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and I know who. Oh wait... Your Majesty.  This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs. Okay. It's him. I figured it out when I realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph. Holley! Show that picture. And then I remembered what they say about old British engines - ""If there ain't no oil under `em, there ain't no oil in `em."" It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan. You just blamed it on me. Then you're faking it. You didn't convert to no electric. We pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there. To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil. I mean, he said it himself with that disguised voice. Yeah, but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else? What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad? Now you're talking!  ""Sir?"" Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna hear none of this ""Sir"" business. By the way, have y'all met each other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen, Queen. McQueen? McMissile. McMissile, McQueen. Queen? McMissile. So there I was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. We was goners. But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us! Holley! Finn! What're you doing here? Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a great time. Everybody! This here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret agent.  Don't tell nobody. And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's --- Explode in a fiery inferno? Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!! You're leaving already? Something tells me you're not talking about souvenir bumper stickers. But I told you all before. I'm not a spy. Well, thanks. But as much fun as it was hanging with y'all, this... This is home. Well, I sure appreciate that, thank you.  Actually... there is one thing. CUT TO: Whoo-hoo!!!  Check it out. They let me keep the rockets! Not if I see you first!"
ali,ALI ,Will Smith," When the contract run out. I want black lawyers and managers. Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle Street... I don't need no ""protectin'"" from myself. Why I need protecting from myself by them...? I ain't one of their thoroughbreds! Or their charity things. ""Let's do somethin' for that well-behaved colored boy, Cassius."" I ain't well-behaved nothing! I am a man. And I am not Cassius. I changed my name. I am Muhammad Ali, now. That's right. No one ""made me""...  I made me.  No one's in that ring but me! I know who I'm not...I'm not drinkin'! Goin' back on my wife! I am not prayin' to no blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesus. I ain't... You saying I'm just like him?  Hey, man, where they put the real pilot? What you doin' up here? No, man, I meant...in L'ville, when I growed up, they barely let black folks drive buses. Hey, man!!! How you doin'? What's up, brother? I knew you were here...didn't think you were still here... We just got here now...  And, maaan, the brothers were flyin' a DC 8. Flippin' switches, navigatin', filing flight plans, talkin' French... Where you goin'? Man, where should I go?   We're planning on Egypt.  ...shouldn't have quarreled with the Honorable Elijah...  You shouldn't have...  ...quarreled with the honorable Elijah Muhammad... You shouldn't have quarreled with Elijah Muhammad. Sonji...Sonji Roi... 'Cause I love it, girl. How long you been workin' for Herbert? What kind of name is that? What's your father do? So who raised you? Whatcha doin' tomorrow?       Go ridin' with me. I square it with Herbert.       I got a record player in my car. Got springs and stuff. Yeah. Only one of 'em's smart...the one with the glasses. People all screaming and fainting. I asked him, ""This the way they act when you get big?"" He said, ""Champ. The more real you get, the more unreal it gonna get."" Let's go...  Where you live? I think I gonna keep you around forever, girl. Herbert said you weren't a Muslim. Why? I'm no virgin...but I may as well be.  I ain't jokin'! I always know when I know. See this face? I mean, you got a pretty face for a girl's face, but you ever seen somethin' as pretty as me? Now, you about five-foot-three...that's too small. But I overlook that, too, 'cause... ...'cause of your spirit! Yeah.   'Cause you too much fun! But you gotta be a Muslim. Maaan, I ain't never been with a girl like you. That's right.   I wanna marry her.  And get me a kosher cook...lady who cooks at Malcolm's temple. Put my brother on the payroll. 50g a year for drivin' and jivin'. Yeah. How 'bout it, Howard. You be my official full-time photographer. No. Marriage is the cornerstone of Muslim life. She gonna be a Muslim, now!  So fix it up, Herbert.  What you drinkin'? What's goin' on?     We're late. What questions?! What? CRAZY MAN  They killed Malcolm...they shot Malcolm.  You were the first...you walked me forward, my brother...you were the first... meets Liston, nails him with a straight right. Ali begins baiting him, dancing. Liston tries to cut off the ring, jabbing ineffectually. Ali lets Liston in, pulls back, then pivots on his right foot, throws a short right and RAMP INTO SLO-MO...to see Liston not see it coming. Get up, sucker! Get up and fight! No one gonna believe this! Why you done up like that? ""Worry""...? The world looks at me, girl! What if I straightened my hair, live in the white suburbs? How I am says something!  Where's Herbert? What do I do...? Please stay, Brother Herbert. I ain't dead! Yeah? Huh? What you talking about?  You know about this? ...I flunk their draft board test. Now, without testing if I am ""wiser"" or ""worser,"" they decide I can go into the Army.  And I'm not Cassius Clay. That's a slave name. I'm a free man. I'm Muhammad Ali.  You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called educated man. You really go to law school? I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth. Keep talking. You were saying something half-smart... Why? I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown... ...of a good ""Ne-gro,"" who do what he told? I stay out of jail and I get to fight. HERBERT  All you have to do is accept the induction. And life goes on.  Yes.  Ask Chauncey Eskridge in Chicago. He's my lawyer. No. I'm out on bail. (goes onto balcony [rear shot]) Yeah, I fight. I fight clean. I'm an athlete. Army's there to kill, kill, kill. My religion forbids that. No. I never shot anything in my life.  Do I know where Vietnam is? (wry; playing to Bingham) Yeah. It's on TV...  In southeast Asia? It there, too?  That's a joke, man...!  What do I think about who?      Vietcong? Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong. No Vietcong ever called me nigger. So what?  I ain't gonna be what anybody else want me to be. I'm not afraid to be what I want. And think how I want.  People are following me... What? They gonna take away what no fighter in the world can? What 'bout Terrell?  Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein' too tall, or havin' flat feet. Why don't he serve for me? Tellin' me what I should do... Yes. Apologize? No.  Yes, sir! Yes, sir. I am not going to apologize to you. This isn't a courtroom. And I don't have to sit here and answer your questions. I ain't draft dodgin'! I ain't goin' to Canada. I ain't burnin' my draft card. I ain't burnin' the flag. I'm stayin' right here. And you want to throw me in jail? Go ahead. I'll do my time. I been in jail four hundred years. I'll be in jail four, five more. But I ain't goin' ten thousand miles to help murder and kill poor people for you. 'Cause if I'm gonna die, I'll die now, right here, fighting you. If I wanna die. You my enemy, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere for you, but you won't even stand up for me in America, for my rights and beliefs, you won't even stand up for me here at home. What...?  What you call me...?  Announce it right here or from flat on your back! What's my name?!? What's my name, motherfucker?! What's my name? Ali, at the apex of his athletic skills, fires six- or eight-punch combinations and then changes direction. Ali shoots jabs and hooks going backwards; every move and set of combinations is a dance. Ali's never been as light on his feet, as fast, as complex as in this fight. Like any moment of greatness, we want it to last forever... Then, Ali throws a 17-punch combination. WHAT'S MY NAME?!  My name?! WHAT'S MY NAME?!  If the court would give me my sentence right now instead of waiting and stalling. Watch now...  Blow on it... This spooky! Don't get scared... So what's fresh, girl?  What's the freshest of the freshest?  Feed me those things, I gotta come back as a wrassler.  645 pounds. I'd still be pretty...but I be fat pretty...  I remember something...   Wha's your name? You had a long braid... That was you? You see the Ellis-Quarry fight? Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin' on him since we was sixteen. They give Ellis to Joe Frazier? Frazier'll kill him. Then they out of juice. Where's the gate? So they gotta let me fight. I fight Ellis in a phone booth...middle of Times Square...you think that draw a crowd? Tijuana? CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE No. State Department refused permission for the one-hour visa. No fight in Tijuana. Look... Can't fight here. Can't fight outside the country... Why I want to be in the restaurant business?! How much all this gonna cost?  Look out! Not then... I always tell the truth... Thought we already got turned down there. Where the money come from, Chauncey? Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on empty. Put aside ""how do that happen""? Licenses all revoked. No passport. I can't fight here. Can't fight abroad.  And what happen if I lose the Supreme Court?  Man give him a shot, he took a shot. How's he? I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em...  May-may! It go in one end and come out the other. You so much better at it, mama.  Maaan...Joe Frazier can't talk, can't up the gate, can't fill the arena. They gotta let me fight. I need Angelo, Rudy, Ferdie --  Cosell? This Muhammad Ali. Go to Georgia or Alabama or Sweden. Everybody know I'm the champ. The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie. Joe Frazier know it's a lie. It time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth. I ain't interested in the paycheck, I'd fight Joe Frazier for free in a phone booth in Times Square, if I wasn't broke. I still will. I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself.  And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down. You can't call me that no more. Whyn't you call an ambulance or a doctor? What's wrong with you, man?! I leave you alone.   You called me! What you shame yourself like this for, maaan...?! Why you shame yourself?! You know ""low."" You so low, the curb look like up! Those rhymes is old.    Forget 'em.  Yeah. No. There's no ""back"" to take you to...  ...you can't do what you do best in the world. And how you feed your family? From prison? Who take care of your kids? And is Allah, is God with me? A thousand dollars to the man who brings me Howard Cosell's toupee! Dead or alive! Put me on, Howard. HOWARD COSELL Muhammad, I'd do anything for you. But I got bosses who only give a damn about Nielsen ratings. I guarantee...it will be a historical and momentous night! ...what Heavyweight Champion of the World? I'm not the champ. I am retired, finished, out of the game. And I ain't gonna let myself grieve and suffer none. But I know I will not fight again... If tomorrow they say: ""We want you to fight Joe Frazier. Madison Square Garden. Millions and millionses of dollars. Here's your license back."" I will tell them: ""I am sorry, but I am done."" You'll have to wonder...what me and Smokin' Joe would have looked like. Howard, you losing your hearing along with your hair? Don't put questions to it!  I am through fighting. 'Cause I got a bigger and more important match comin' up. The U.S. government. A heavier contender. HOWARD COSELL Do you think you're going to jail? I don't know, but it's going to be a shocking and terrible fight. In fact, they might wish they let me stay in boxing. There you go, agitatin'.  You ask Smokin' Joe what he been smokin'?! Joe Frazier even dream he can whup me? He better wake up and apologize...  But, if I WAS to jump in the ring with Joe, here's what you might see...  Ali comes out to meet Frazier, but Frazier starts to retreat; If Frazier goes back an inch farther, he'll wind up in a ringside seat; Ali swings with a left, Ali swings with a right. Frazier keeps backin', but there's not enough room. It a matter of time before Ali lowers the boom; Now Ali lands with a right, what a beautiful swing, But the punch lifts Frazier clean out of the ring. Frazier's still risin', but the referee wears a frown, 'Cause he can't start countin' 'til Frazier come down. And Frazier's disappeared from view. And the crowd is getting frantic. Then our radar stations pick him up. He's somewhere over the Atlantic. Who would have thought when they came to this fight, That they would witness the launching of a black satellite? But don't wait for they fight. 'Cause it ain't never gonna happen. You only can wonder and imagine... You want me to buy you a drink? Ali's dad sits on a crate, painting the door of a delivery truck. He looks up...Ali is there. Emotion wells up in both men. The younger ""rebelistic"" son, seeing his father, who is so like him. The older hep-cat who got cheated by life of his potential and promise. In this case, his boy, his boy's name, pride and reflected glory... I don't wanna fight no more.   Not with you... Who dress you, Joe?   You look like Dale Evans. To be closer to you, honey. There be two undefeated heavyweight champions! And they ain't fighting! You wanna get this on, Joe?     You and me? Or not?! I can fight in Atlanta. Georgia ain't got no state boxing commission. And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But we got to get the steamroller movin' now. You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me the title shot.  So what you say...maaan? But you know you ain't the champ yet.  I'm fine. Thanks. What you want? You want me to take you back?  You can't hit what you can't see. All praise to Allah... (a beat, and softly...) ...Alaikum Salaam... You saying I can be a Muslim again, Herbert?  I never stopped. Like I never stopped being champ. When? After I promoted Quarry fight? After I won it? I already got Frazier. Are we talking management, talking money or talking religion?  When I got leery and talked up how come I'm broke, then came the suspension. Now, you explain that to me, my brother...? Now, you go on out. And you make the Frazier deal. Yeah... What are you talking about, Howard? Quarry? I'm free. ANGELO DUNDEE What are you talking about? Supreme Court set me free.  Hook's comin'. Lean back, man! Move back! WORK LEGS...! Shut up! I lost.  Get outta here... Where's Belinda? My hands was in sand, Angie.     My feet in water... Woulda, shoulda, coulda...  After three-and-a-half years, this...from how far back...comeback is. I lost. You lose, you don't shoot yourself. The world goes on.  Oh, how wrong he is. I ain't dead, baby!     C'mon. I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got me... Ain't stoppin' nothin'...!  Nothin' stoppin'...!  Foreman call me one time after he won the Olympics... So.  You think I still got the tools?  Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa. BUNDINI The motherland. From the root to the fruit. We gonna rumble...in the jungle. It's time to be heavyweight champion of the world again. Man, you crazy.  What are they saying, man?!!!    Why they saying that?  What?! Ali, boma ye! Ali, boma ye!  Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts.  Back up, maaan... (weaves suddenly; another voice) ...you fast!  Ali, boma ye George Foreman! You out, sucker! Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids came. Foreman?   I kill him! Shazaam!!!  ...even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter what...I gotta win. Howard! How many you ugly sportswriters in there got me over Foreman? Don't lie.  What's the odds? This'll be the biggest upset since Sonny Liston. I want all of you to write it down! This fight is no contest! George Foreman is a big mummy. I've officially named him ""The Mummy."" George punches are like ""Look out, here come the left."" Whomp!  Here come the right! Whomp! Like a Mummy. But ""The Mummy"" can't hit what it can't see. I'm fast! Gonna dance. Be all over George. George is gonna feel he surrounded.  And I done somethin' new for this fight; I done rassled with an alligator. Anticipatory laughter. They've had twelve years' experience of Ali's stand-up and know when a new routine's starting... That's right! (laughter again; Ali almost loses it) I have rassled with an alligator. I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail. That's bad! Only last week I murdered a rock. Injured a stone. Hospitalized a brick. I'm so mean, I make medicine sick. Howard. I didn't want to talk about this, especially in front of everybody. But I talked to your wife! And she told me you're not the man you used to be...two years ago! Salaam Alaikum, brothers!  The champ is here! Bottled water. Frozen steaks. Brought all this stuff like Africans don't have steaks... They eat it. Mobutu eats it...  So? What's that do with any of why we here? Here come ""Herbert."" Money? I do ""money-making"" whenever I want. Money is easy. Don King delivered the first black- promoted championship fight in Africa! 'Cause clean-cut Muslims parading on the South Side of Chicago don't get this done! I got to put honkeys with connections and bad- ass niggers to it, too. That what this is? Think I gonna lose? Puttin' doubt on me? Sure.  Truth is...George knocked hisself out. That's right. He did three rounds. Knew he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali and knocked hisself out. And I predict that whenever the fight is set, he might not show up! I'm a bad man! And you tell the same thing to George.  I been watchin' you! I heard you. I know he's your man. I know you got him picked. But the man's in trouble. The whole world was gonna know. But, now, he ain't gonna show. That's why he knocked hisself out when he was training.  Uh-huh. I want all helicopters guarded! Private boats. Private jets. I want the airport -- I'm serious -- I want President Mobutu and all his paratroopers. Mobutu and all his paratroopers. I want all of you ""Zaireans"" to be on guard! Watch all strange boats tryin' to slip away! They might be takin' him out. Yeah. Watch the bus station. Watch everything! Elephant caravans. He might sneak out by elephant.  Hey!!! Don't talk to Angelo like that! Don't you talk to him like that ever again!!! You think you're callin' these shots, Don? You're not.  They know! (segues into a routine) All those ladies out there know.  They know I'm ready! I see fear in the eyes of his followers! I see fear! This is the fight that Muhammad Ali was supposed to be ended. The myth of Muhammad was supposed to fall! (hits the table with his fist; glares at King) Supposed to be my destruction! (French voices and laughter, understated) They miscalculated. They misjudged. They got it...wrong. Say, girl...! C'mere.   I know you? What's your name? Like the sports car. But with a little something extra.  Veronica, I know you now. C'mere, sit down. You with Don? Where you from?  Well...they all came together real nice. You been to Hong Kong?   Taiwan? Thailand? I can't go there. All the ladies out there from Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India... (high-pitched voice, imitating female fans) ""Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh, Muhammad Al-i-i-i!"" (speaks in faux foreign language, imitating female fans; to Bingham) You seen those people from Thailand? I was in Bangkok -- I couldn't walk. (laughter; hangs his head) I couldn't...I just couldn't do nothin'. ""Get me outta this country!""  The women were so pretty...  Ladies in Thailand, their hair comes down to their knees...and they about Veronica's complexion...and they bad! But they ain't nothin' like the ""sisters."" (holds Veronica's hands, looks deep into her eyes) Ain't NOTHIN' like the sisters!  Let's go for a ride. So why you glad we still here? That's one job.    I got two...  ...gotta whup George! Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am busted out and failed in the eyes of God. I shoulda discovered Islam at 50! 'Cause I am weak on women. They take my eyes and my heart follow...causing me to be a lovin' husband and a terrible husband...! (looks down at her, intensely) ...green eyes and cocoa skin...?  ...okay, rest of me, let's go!!  Faster! Faster! Why not? Hey! Look! Look at George Foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on purpose! On the side, to see if I'm in shape! We'll, you ain't gonna find no fat! Watch out!! She's gotta put it on. ""George"" buttons is all I got. In my bedroom! All over the bed! Everywhere! To remind me...of all of ya'. All of ya'! Reminds me of all ya'! Yeah. When did you get in? You know what's going on. (it's not the first time) I didn't mean for it to come out... I know that. I didn't mean for it to be... I respect you.   I always respect you. I follow my heart. I fight George.  I didn't come this far to quit. Thanks to Allah... Why?  Foreman ain't no mummy. He's knocked out eight out of eleven before the end of the third round. He the most dangerous fighter I ever fought. And I can't WAIT! Motherfucker, you 'bout to discover you ain't nothin'.  You been hearin' about me for years. All your life you been hearin' about Muhammad Ali. Now you gotta face me.  You never should have come to Africa.  Legs heavy...air's heavy...like sand... That all you got...?   That it?  There is nothin'... Nothin'! (another Foreman hook lands) ...I cannot take. Thought you was bad!  Here come George's ""murder"" round. George!    Show me something. Where's your punch, man?!  ...been here before.  Open the door, Richard...outta this room... Put on your coat, man...get out...  Think my fight's over...? That...  ...all you got? That the hardest you hit? C'mon, chump!!! Took somethin' away from him, Angie, that round...  They don't know what's happenin'.  You bet the wrong horse! He can't fight no better than you can act!  Take it! Terrify him with what you can take...  Eight more rounds... You runnin' outta gas?  ...can't let you get that second wind which you don't know is out there for you.  Want the title...wear the heavyweight crown?  Jaw broke? Nose smashed? Face busted? You ready to die? Is that you?  'Cause you gonna meet a man who will die before he let you win.  Now...  RIGHT NOW!  I don't know what's gonna happen.  Maan, everything is crazy. You think you got a chance, chump? Now you in trouble. You even dream of beating me?   You better wake up and apologize! Kid throws a punch.     Ali collapses to his knees. He too much for me!"

Now we are going back. Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are? We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg. Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway. Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards. Why? People fart backwards. Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years. Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick! No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards! Em iram! Em iram! No, this is serious.

Certainly! Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you? These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it. What do you mean? Why what, sir? Humiliated? If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me. No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy. Excuse me! And the other one? And the other one? Oh, they're both so beautiful, I can't decide. Why don't I have two heads? Your Majesty! Oh, thank you.  Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely. I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours? Mio caro Adone. A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.  Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo! Majesty! Oh, German! German! Please let it be German. Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto! I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately. It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a - In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio. Exactly. Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care. Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely! Love, Sire! No, I don't think you do. I mean watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching. Stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about! That's not love - it's just rubbish. Majesty, you choose the language. It will be my task to set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch. Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head. I think so, Sire, yes.  The rest is just the same, isn't it? That really doesn't work, does it? Did you try this? Wouldn't it be just a little more -? Or this - yes, this! Better. It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire? And German? So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty? What do you mean, Sire? I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.  But this is absurd! Which few did you have in mind, Majesty? Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady. Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether. Twenty-six. Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage. What? I'll be right back. You should really go home now, Frau Weber. Your carriage must be waiting. I have to talk to the singers. Oh - excuse me! No, she's fine. Did you like it, then? It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree? What?? Of course. Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore. I will. Most beloved father, it is done. Do not blame me that I did not wait to see your dear face. I knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and I could not have borne it. Your every word is precious to me. Remember how you have always told me Vienna is the City of Musicians. To conquer here is to conquer Europe! With my wife I can do it.  I vow I will become regular in my habits and productive as never before. She is wonderful, Papa, and I know that you will love her. And one day soon when I am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy. I long for that day, best of Papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times. What is this, Herr Chamberlain? Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl. Is the Emperor angry with me? Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post? No, but I'm the best. Who is on this committee? Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians! They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid. Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music! Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not! Oh, leave me alone. They'll come anyway. They love me here. Oh yes? You always know everything. You borrowed money from your mother? Well, don't do that again! Don't be stupid. Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them. Stanzi! Stanzi! Stanzi-Manzi! Sssh! Sssh! Stay here.  Stanzi? How's my mouse? Mouse-wouse? I'm back - puss-wuss is back! Stanzi! What's the matter? What is it? Stanzi! Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving. What's the matter with you? Sssh. What is it? Tell me. Yes! Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now. She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know. So you see, this post is very important to me right now. Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted? Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please! Whom did they choose? Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity. But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess! Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage. No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why. How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all! They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend! Do you have a daughter? Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe! I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret. Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it? Ah. Italian? Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty? I can't say. Really And which one of them do you want me to teach?  Madame. I'm afraid I am. Really? Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg. I'd like a little wine, if you have it. Now, please play me something. Just to give me an idea. Anything will do. Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein? Who was your teacher? Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know. Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone. I think we're both a little shy. Perhaps if I were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein.  Why don't you let me try the instrument? All right?  Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir! Papa! PAPA! Why are you here? Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa! Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see. I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi! Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see. Oh! I didn't know you were home. Stanzi, this is my father. We'll wait, we'll wait. Why don't you get up now, darling? She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me. Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself. It couldn't be better. What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here. Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie! Pupils? Yes. I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition. This one will. Oh, let's not talk about it. It's a secret. It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is! My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter? He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa. Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted. Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did. Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? What? How can you be so boring? Tea! Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!  This is just a game, Papa. Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the fun. Come on. Here, take mine. Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room. But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty. Oh, that's really too easy. Any child can do that. Give me a name. Who shall I do? Give me a name. Now that's hard. That's very hard. For Salieri one has to face the right way around. What is it? What does she want? Well, ask her! Oh, damn! Yes? That's right. What? Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is? Papa, is this your idea? Are you playing a trick on me? Stanzi! Papa! No one calls you that. Thank you, Sire! Baron! Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour? May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him. Father - Yes, Sire. Who told you this, Majesty? Well, yes, I admit it is. Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy. But, Your Majesty - Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics. But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love. But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that? Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it. Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.  Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous? Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends? Oh, bello, bello, bello! Come on now, be honest. Wouldn't you all rather listen to your hairdressers than Hercules? Or Horatius? Or Orpheus? All those old bores! people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble! Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not. Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it? How can I persuade you if you won't let me show it? Just let me tell you how it begins. May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that? Look! There's a servant, down on his knees. Do you know why? Not from any oppression. No, he's simply measuring a space. Do you know what for? His bed. His wedding bed to see if it will fit. Certainly, Herr Director. Five minutes, please! Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding. But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story. What are you doing? What are you doing, Herr Director? Please! Please. I've no one else to turn to. Please! It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it. I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him? Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry! Oh no! My wife took it out in time. It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work. Oh, Excellency, would you? Thank you! Oh, thank you. Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director! Ladies and gentlemen, we're going from where we stopped. The Count: Anches so. Right away, please! Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn. But what is it they don't like? What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all? It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come? I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that. Oh no, the honour would be all mine. Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!  Well? That kind of music should be punishable by death. How could I not? How could it not, Excellency? I never knew that music like that was possible. Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri! Oh. Everybody's here! We've got guests. Good. I've brought some more. We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl. Yes, my love? Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg. (to the two men, jubilantly) If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with! What? Wonderful! (indicating his baby son) He liked the monkey, didn't you? I liked the horse. I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it. Animals? German! No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio. Half the receipts! Stanzi! Why not? Half the house! Oh, Stanzi.  Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.  Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand! Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music? Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction? Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead? If a man cannot earn, he must borrow. No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours. Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. What work? What dead? Who is dead? Who are you? How much? How long will you give me? No one. I'm not telling you. You'd think I was mad. No. Don't answer it! Tell him I'm not here. Tell him I'm working on it. Come back later. Leave that alone! Put it down! Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you. What? Yes. No. Because there's nothing to see. Well, we can. Here. It's all right here, in my noodle. The rest is just scribbling. Scribbling and bibbling. Bibbling and scribbling. Would you like a drink? I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time. No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can! This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I? Give me two more weeks. Please. I can't write it! It's killing me. Go back to bed. Stanzi? Stanzi-marini-bini? What happened? Is it over? No, no. I have to get back. I have -  Papa! Papa! Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa. You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you. I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did. This is only a vaudeville. Do you mean that? I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things. The doctor thinks I am. But - I'm too young to be so sick. No! No, it's him! The man. He's here. Tell him to go away. Tell him I'm still working on it. Don't let him in! Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it. He knows. He knows! What happened? Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred? Would you? Actually, you could. But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed. You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write. A Mass. A Mass for the Dead. Where did I stop? So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that? Do you believe in it? A fire which never dies. Burning one forever? Strange! We ended in F Major? So now - A minor. Suddenly. The Fire. Common time. Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course. Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that? Sing it back. Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right? Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. (He hurriedly hums the opening notes of the bass vocal line) The first bassoon and tenor trombone - It couldn't be simpler. With the tenors. Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant. Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.  Second measure on B.  Do you have me? Show me.  Good, good - yes! Put it down. And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising - C to D to E, up to the dominant chord. Do you see? Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed. C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. (singing the alto part) Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis. Yes, and on 'dictis'. And underneath, just violins - arpeggio.  The descending scale in eighth notes, and then back suddenly to the fire again.  And that's it. Do you have it?  Do you have it? Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now! Do you want to rest a bit? We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa. Would you stay with me while I sleep a little? I am so ashamed. I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!"
2012,JACKSON ,John Cusack," Oh no. Not again. Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not late. It's not even 10:30... Damn it!  Kate, I'm on my way... For god's sake...

The whole darn lake is gone. I swear you guys there was a lake here. It's okay, Noh'. Isn't this supposed to be a National Park? There shouldn't be fences. What are you guys doing around here anyway? So, where did the lake go?  Yeah, that's me. You're one of lucky 422 who bought it. Oh, I see. Yes he was, Lil'bee. They think it's not such a good idea to climb over their fences. They feel the area is unstable. We'll get some of that tomorrow. For tonight just put your head under the blankie. I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you wearing your pull-ups? Did mommy buy you that? Noah. Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family. Go to sleep guys. Hi. Mind if I join you? I just heard part of your broadcast... Mind me asking a question? What exactly is it... that will start in Hollywood? What are you talking about? If they all knew, don't you think somebody would tell us? A seat? Oh... I see. Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My kids are sleeping. Night, Charlie. Just stop scratching. You'll get them infected. Something for Mosquito bites please? What?  Kids, we have to pack up and go find mommy.

Listen to me. We have to find Charlie. He's got a secret map, you know, like Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'. Lil', we have to work as a team now, okay? You have to help me. Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart. Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes. You're the best, darling. Give Daddy the phone...  Kate I am sorry, I can't talk... You wait here for me!

You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours... Let's go! I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay? That's disgusting. How much fuel do we have? Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither. Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal. I couldn't have left you... By `people' are we talking about me? Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now... Do you love him? Gordon... Let's go wake up the kids. What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon. I don't know him that well. I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise. Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet. Your daddy has to tell you something. I know that with my writing and work I didn't have a lot of time for you both... I wasn't there for you, the way I should have been. ... And I am so very sorry for that. No shit.  It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement' Gordon... Prof. Hapgood, 1958. Way to go Charlie! We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon. Everybody okay back there? Thank you...  Say thank you, kids. Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great. You guys hear that?  Hey! Help! Wait for us! Shit! Shit! Come with daddy.

You did it, man. You did it. We have to move him higher.  Over there! I'll go back. I'll try my best. You stay with Mommy. I'll be right back... If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me. There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared.  That's my big girl. I thought you might want this. Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think?"

Uh, I was going to the xerox room because they needed these by 5:00. Hello.  Mrs. Baskin? How are you? I just wanted you to know that Josh is all right.  He's okay. Yeah.  And you're gonna get him back, just the way he was. Wow!  Thanks! Oh, he can't come to the phone right now. I didn't do anything to him!  I think he's a terrific kid! Uh, well, all right.  Ask me something that only he would know.  Then I'll ask him for you and that way you'll know that he's okay. Isn't there something else that you would rather ask him? Oh, I got it!  I got it!  Memories, like the corner of my mind.  Misty water color memories, of the way we were.  Scattered pictures...Look, you're gonna see him again really soon.  I promise.  I cross my heart.

Well, the pieces don't move. Well, on the old set you could slide the men up and down the ice, and now all they do is spin around.  It was more like real hockey the old way.  Why did they change it? You see, the Star Fighters are good because you can change all the pieces.  But I never liked the Galactakons.  You only get one robot, and they don't come with a vehicle. Plus you can't take them underwater.  And if you do they...Neat! Three years. Oh, I'm in computers. No. No.  They got a hundred of them.  Are we ready? Come on in. How would you know? Oh yes! You know that only costs 10 bucks to make. Oh, well, this is just...They just put this in here...it doesn't mean anything. Well, I play with all of this stuff and then, I go in there and tell them what I think. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, thank you Miss Patterson.  Hey!  Miss Patterson.  Could you call down to Media and have them send up a video tape of the Giants Broncos Super Bowl?  And have them edit out all the commercials and talkin' and stuff? Miss Patterson. I don't get it. It turns from a building into a robot, right? Well, what's fun about that? Oh. I still don't get it. Well, there's a million robots that turn into something.  And this is a building that turns into a robot.  So what's so fun about playing with a building?  That's not any fun! Well, couldn't it be like a robot that turns into something like a bug or something? Different sizes and things.  And...you could have them wreck something... Dear Mom and Dad.  They said that I could write you and let you know I was okay.  So far, they're treating me fine.  I've got enough to eat and I'm perfectly safe.  They say that I'll get out of here in about a month.  In the mean time, it's a lot like camp!  I watch TV and even get outside once in a while.  I know you miss me.  But try not to worry.  I think this experience might even be good for me.  I love you very much and I know that I'll see you soon.  Your son, Joshua.  P.S. Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother. I rented it.  This is a real bow tie though.  I tied it myself.  And that's why I was late. Hey, there's Miss Patterson!  Hi!  There's the guy from the meeting! Hi! Hi. Thanks. Could I have a milkshake or something? Uh Huh. Wow!  Is this your car? Oh, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen! Are you gonna eat these fries? Hey mister?  You want some of these fries?  We're not going to eat them. No. Ejector seat!  This is great!  Hey!  Come on up!  Hey, that was my apartment. No, not always. Yeah. Well, they said it was gonna take six weeks. Watch your step. Do what? Do you mean sleep over? Okay!  But I get to be on top! Yeah.  It's nice, isn't it? You uh, want a soda? Soda?  You want one? They rigged this up so you don't need any quarters....Don't!  Don't...! The glue's not dry.  Sorry. It's okay....You wanna play pinball? You don't need quarters for this either.  It's free. Okay. Yeah.  You wanna try it? You should.  It's really fun.  It's simple, too.  Come on!  Come on! You'll like it and it's really easy to do. I'm serious... Take off your shoes...It's really easy....Let me get rid of these balls. Come on.  It's fun.  I'll do it with you.  Up you go.  Excellent. Sure. Okay.  Jump. Yes. No!  No!  No!  I mean really jump.  Now get some air between you and the trampoline. Oh, come on!  I'll do it with you!  All right?  I'll show you how to do it.  You ready?  Come on.  Jump.  See?  There it is.  That's all there is to it.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah!  It's easy!  Anybody could do this! Here.  Pick one....It's for you.  It's a glow in the dark compass ring...so you won't get lost....Goodnight. Wouldn't you rather play basketball?  I know how to play that.  We could be like a team for the Macmillan Company. I'm not very good at sports, but I'll give it a try.  My best sport is video hockey. Well, it takes eye to hand coordination. What about golf?  You don't sweat and that's a sport. What about car racing? What are the rules again? Sorry.  Sorry. Okay. Uh, that was under the line. That was under the line.  You said it had to be over the line on a serve. Yeah you did!  You said it had to be over the line on a serve! Well that's cheating! No! It's my serve. Yes you did. Cheater!  You cheat! You cheat!  You cheat! He didn't have to punch me. I tried to play his game.  He beat me up.  If he's scared of me then why did he punch me? I don't get it. Well how come you're so nice? Well, you work just as hard as he does and you're not like that. Yes I do.  You're one of the nicest people I've met. Uh, I can't Billy. No, I can't...I have to go somewhere. Um...well, I have to go meet somebody and... Yeah I know, but it's just...well I can't right now okay, but I'll call you, all right?  Okay?  I'll give you a call.  Thanks again Billy, it was fun! Sure. Yeah!  Yeah! Want to go again?! So they have these cars that you can actually drive them except they're on this rail so you can't get off the road...You have a really big gob of mustard right, right... Mustard right.... Right there. Well,.... Yeah. What?  Music? Dance? Okay.  Okay. We could get some hot chocolate....You can wear my jacket if you want. Oh, I wasn't much different. Susan?  There's something I think I should tell you. Hey Frank, how are you?  Good morning everybody! I'd like some coffee please Miss Patterson. And uh, make it black. Yeah, the Santa Christina. He only had that on his second trip, though. No, but I used to study...stuff. Algebra?  I used to study that, too. All right, let's say Larry Bird is going to score 10 points in the first quarter. How many is he going to score in the whole game? Probably.  Okay.  And that's algebra. Yeah!  See.  Okay.  One quarter is to ten points that he scores in that quarter.  Just as four.... I cannot plan a whole line! I can't! But it's.... All right...I don't know...I don't have any new ideas for toys or anything. You see it won't be like these where you just follow the story along. You would actually make a whole different story appear just by pressing these buttons. Yeah.  An electric comic book.  It's gonna be different every time. If you like one you could see it, you know, over and over and over again. You really like it?...You think Mac will like it?  You know, what we could do...We could do like sports comics...or like if you're going to steal second or something like that...You'd have sports books...baseball, football...really, it work with almost any sport there is.  Hockey! You know, we're....Is something wrong?  You don't like it? How do I feel about what? What is that supposed to mean? Well, Wednesday would be better than Thursday... Yeah, I have the Keating example right here... Shh!  I'm right in the middle of something okay? Can you give me just a minute, please? Would you come back at lunch?  All right, I'm a little bit busy right now...Hello? Billy! Jesus, Billy!  Miss Patterson, could you get them on the phone again.... I've got work to do!  Can't you understand that?  I've got a deadline to meet.  God! Hey! You don't get it, do you?  This is important! You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard.  All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs....Melt wizard....What do you want to melt him with?  ...Throw thermal pod. I haven't told you something because if I did, I didn't think you'd believe me.  And even if you did believe me, I didn't think you were going to like me anymore, so.... Susan, I'm not what you think I am. SUSAN What do you mean? Before I met you I was in little league.  I was in little league and I rode my bike to school and I played with my friends and hung out with them and.... I want to go home.  I miss my family Susan and I want to go home. No!  No! No.  No.  Susan, I'm not married. No.  I'm a child! I'm a child Susan, and I'm not ready for all this. Well, you see what happened.... No!  No!  No! No!  You don't understand!  I mean, I'm thirteen years old! No!  I mean I really am thirteen!  I went to bed one night and I was a kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up. There was this carnival in New Jersey.  I made a wish on this machine. It was called a Zoltar Machine... It was called a Zoltar Machine!  It had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you could make a wish and I did!  So I made a wish to be big!  That is what I'm trying to tell you!  I changed into a grown up but I'm really just a kid! Yes? Thanks. There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it. And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what the character's going to do...Like if he going to go in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons. Paul. Well, it's a comic book that.... I'll be right back. Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York? Work!  Damn it!....I wish I was a kid. Susan! I know.  I know.  I'm really sorry.  I'm really sorry but I didn't know what to do.  I didn't know what to say. I tried to tell you. I tried to tell you last night. I've been thinking about this and there are a million reasons for me to go home but there is only one reason for me to stay. Well, you...Oh, come on.  Don't cry. I'm 13. Maybe you could come with me. Why not? I'm sorry. The one right there. I'm gonna miss you, too. Oh yes I will. Mom?  Hello! MOM Josh?  Josh!  Josh!  Oh my God!  Oh, thank God you're home! Oh Ma, I missed you all so much! I'm just not good enough. You really think I could do it? Come on.  We'll hit some after supper."
creation,DARWIN ,Martha West," They were all completely naked, the men as well as the women, with hair down to their bottoms. They spoke in grunts and they never washed their hands and faces! In many respects they resembled wild animals, except that animals are kinder to their children. One day, Captain Fitzroy went ashore to meet them. No. It is only a beam of light. Well they prepare a copper plate with chemicals on it. The chemicals are sort of energized by the light reflecting off your face. Then silver sticks onto the plate according to where the light is brightest. So as I was saying, Captain Fitzroy went ashore to interview the Fuegans.... After some discussion persuaded three of the savages` children to come home with him. Their names were Jemmy Buttons, York Minster and Fuegia Basket. The captain had them washed and got their hair cut, then dressed them in proper clothes, and taught them proper table manners. York Minster died of the smallpox but the other two learned English and went to meet the queen. Two years later. Captain Fitzroy and I took them back, in the company of a young Parson, hoping they would bring the other savages to god and to teach the others by example. And what do you think happened?  Correct! A complete and total failure! Thank you Parslow He won't stay long. I think this is not the time to discuss it. He sent a telegram. I'm sorry if it inconveniences you.  Tell Mr Davies it was delicious, but my stomach is not quite right yet.  Excuse me. Maybe best if I just burn the whole lot. Don't be absurd. Of course you're not. Ah yes. Of course I remember. Annie. Annie. Annie. Just playing. I should add that she is musical. Do you mean there will be more. Appeal? Dearest cousin. I am making plans for an army! Cycrus caraboides. You can see from the mandibles he's a hunter. He feeds on slugs and snails. Oh tush.... I studied Theology for a year but yet I know exceedingly little of the bible. I should look forward to that immensely. On the Beagle, quite, often we would drop a flask in the ocean and find it teeming with living particles which glowed in the night ....so much beauty for so little purpose. Are you familiar with the works of Thomas Malthus, Mr Innes?. He made the point that if every trout, say, has a hundred offspring And so on and so on through the generations. Then the planet would be knee deep in trout in just a few decades. It doesn't strike you as an exceedingly wasteful plan - these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished. You think they are happy about it? ....To be doing Gods will. No I'm serious. If thousands are destroyed that a few may live their lives, is not the general sum total of happiness not in some kind of massive deficit? I think it is a battlefield. A constant and shifting struggle for survival between everything and everything else. Ring the two milky pouters. We'll sacrifice the tumblers and skeletonize them. Then... Just. ...to the shed with them. I shall clean myself up.  Please I must beg of you....  Sir, you are talking like a revolutionary and really... And you'd replace Gods Laws with what. Knowing, as we do, that most capital crimes are her everyday practises: Theft, rape, murder, adultery, infanticide.... We live in a society bound together by the church. An improbable sort of barque I grant you but at least it floats. You suggest we change all that at a stroke. You wish me to rebuild, plank by plank, the very vessel we are sailing in. Like you said. You're in it. What are you doing, Annie? I have to work. I have no time.... Why do you always ask for Jenny? Its so sad. Once apon a time there was a family of Orang-u-tangs living in the jungles of darkest Borneo Their eldest daughter was the most loving, caring and trusting Orang of all. But these qualities in themselves cannot guarantee an ape's survival. Sometimes, quite the reverse. When she realized her danger it was too late. They put her in a bag and carried her off.... Exactly. The hunters sold her the to the Sultan who promptly sold her to a visiting Englishman who packed her aboard a sailing ship and brought her to London zoo. In London she had many admirers - of whom your father was but one. Hoo hoo hoo hoo. Hm? Go on what. No. Why do you want to hear that bit? Presently. He thinks I should write it and be done with it. He feels it is a question of moral courage ...or the lack of it. His theory is that I am making myself ill by holding back. That I should lance the boil. Plunge in and hang the consequences. I've concluded he is right. Bite the gag. Speed is everything. It will all be over in a matter of months.  You know that what concerns you concerns me also. What do think has held me in limbo all these years. Dearest Emma. You know This is not a decision made lightly.... .... It has been a very slow and gradual process, like the raising of continents. What else can I say to you, except that it seems the process is now complete. Excuse me Never better. Thank-you. A weasel. Annie, Annie, Annie. The weasel has to eat. Its the way of the world. Annie No, its not fair at all. ....but still it is extraordinary, do you not think, that a weasel should learn to dance the polka. Good-night George Good-night Willy Dearest Emma  Then we were wrong. She is not unique after all. This is Devonian, about 400 million years ago. Rocks like this might have fishes in them, trilobites, tree ferns, corals maybe.... No that is Cretaceous Etty. It was made a hundred millions years ago, when this cliff was a coral reef and Down village was a swamp full of great crocodiles. We might find oysters and sponges imprinted in it, or dinosaurs if we were lucky... They are the giant lizards which lived on earth before there were any humans. Of course they are, Betty. Did I never tell you of the skeletons I found in South America  Do you remember Mr Martell? You should have your clothes on Annie. You are quite blue. Well don't fall and hurt yourself. Your mother would never forgive me. Annie! Dearest Hooker. I am one week into the great project and I feel at last that it is real. Its title is ""On the Origin of Species."" As I write theses words why does it feel as though I am confessing to a murder... What happened? Its not nothing.  Why are your knees bleeding? Words are very well. I am asking what happened to her knees. What! Repented what? It is by no means finished. Where is my coat. Its intolerable  In his rights to torture our children for expressing the plain truth. Well damn how he sees it. Damn the pair of them and all their works Emma please. I will not have Innes tell me what I can and cannot tell my children. You're right of course.... I'm sorry. You're still angry with me. I can always tell by your playing.  And say what? She does not want to hear it.  That is what I am doing Annie, I am writing all of it. ....and then she can read it, and we can all be free of this! Now, please, Annie no more interruptions! Pull! ... In time small variations become extreme... ...Organs change their very function, the oviduct becomes a cement gland. Nothing that need concern you. Pull! ....What was once a free- swimming creature now finds itself glued by its head to a rock, flailing for food with its legs..., No of course not. How can there be? If he is supposed to be loving and forgiving - what on earth is the sense punishing all these millions of souls. All what? I don't know what you mean. All what? Pull! He is what? A physician now No thank you. Annie? .....Annie. Annie! No. No I am but one of many. There is Squire Lubbock, and the reverend Innes ...which no-one has read. Barnacles. How do you do it? Get rid of them. All of them. All of it. Go. Go! God know. A pox on all of them! I will not give it to her. Not to any of mine I hope. On the Beagle I dropped some on a microscope slide and all my animacules died of it. On Madeira they thrived most excellently, as did Captain Fitzroy, while it lasted. I will write to Dr Gully again. I have always found his treatments most effective. Logic is not everything. Parslow will bring your carriage. I will be down presently I should take her to Malvern. Gully can care for her properly there. She can be treated daily, as I was. Ha!! By odd means Yes. It is from the Spice islands. You are still young. You could be a missionary and follow in Mr Livingstone's footsteps. Not any more, thank goodness It has been finished for me. My correspondent In the spice islands has arrived independently at exactly the same idea, expressed in a mere twenty pages. There's brevity for you. I had so far covered two hundred an fifty and come to a dead end. So finally I am rid of the project. He does indeed Mr Innes. I was reflecting only the other day on the fact that he has endowed us in his blessed generosity with not one but nine hundred species of intestinal worm each with its own unique method of infiltrating the blood supply and burrowing through the mucosa. And then again on the great love he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp to lay eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillars No. We can leave that for Mr Wallace now. Should I advise him to stay overseas do you think? If he shows his face in Kent he may be required to kneel on rock salt. What? I am forestalled by Mr Wallace. That is the simple fact of it. What reason do you have to be angry?! Annie! No. No. I will not be bled or lectured to. No. Simply the great relief of liberation. Did you read the Wallace abstract. ...barely half of it You have been talking to Huxley. I cannot. Seriously Joseph, I am completely blocked. All my old symptoms have returned with a vengeance. The sweats the shakes the abdominal pains. The whole endeavour was cursed from the outset. Not Malvern What are you talking about. I have no enemies. You cannot come. How can you possibly come in your condition. It is two days by coach and train. Who will look after the others. Leave us please, Etty. The coach is outside. I will carry her from here. You will see Mamma when you are better. Say goodbye now. Please, Emma Get aboard. Brodie  Go. Go. Go now! Tell him not this way. ...by the low road. I was persuaded to write book. Poorly.  I had the gardener build a water tower. It no longer has any effect. I feared I was dying. Does the exercise of memory count as an action. My eldest daughter. You remember her. I know that. I know. No. It is a scientific text. But I had reached a point, beyond which it was impossible to progress. She had been my companion throughout. Now it seemed she was ahead of me in a place I could not follow. That is what my wife believes. It is a great consolation to her Emma and I have become ...divided on it. We have none ...to speak of. I don't know what it means. Well, until someone devises a machine to read nervous impulses, or a telescope to look inside the body I suppose we can only guess at it. Mrs St John? Sorry. I'm confused. What is it you do exactly. Envision how? When Gully described you I fancied some scientific instrument.... Well. I have a ten shilling note here in my wallet. If you can tell me the numbers on it we can begin. I am a professional man. And I asking for no more than I ask of all my colleagues - a demonstration of competence. Then I am sorry to have wasted your time. How dare you. ...prey on people's grief like this.  Do you take me for an idiot? Clearly Gully has appraised you of my history. It is chicanery of the very lowest order and I despise it utterly! Annie. Annie! Is Mrs Carey still the landlady here. My daughter Annie ...lodged here some years ago. Can I come in? I know this is an intrusion. I wonder - could I visit the room she stayed in? Fourteen. I would only be there ten minutes. I am happy to pay. I remember. Is she any better? Does she want for anything? Darling Annie. I am here now. Dearest Emma. I think it best for you to know how every hour passes. It's a relief for me to tell you. Whilst writing to you I can cry tranquilly. Mr Coates the Surgeon came today to draw off Annie's water. This did not hurt her, but she struggled with surprising strength against being uncovered. Save her. I will believe whatever. Forever. Please save her Our dear child has taken a turn for the worse. She talked a great deal but we could seldom make out anything. Much of what she says we cannot make out from the roughness of her poor mouth. Today she vomited rather much again. Dr Coates has been to draw off more water. Is that good, my lovely Gully thinks her in imminent danger. We sponged her with water and vinegar, made her sweet with chloride of lime....I fear we must prepare ourselves for the worst What? I don't understand my love. What about her. I don't want to talk about death my love. Well. What the keeper told me was. When she was very sick with pneumonia, lying very still, he tried to feed her but she shook her head, looking at him as though to say: ""Its nice of you but really you shouldn't bother"". And as he bent down to take the spoon away she brought her arms around his neck and kissed him. And then she was dead. Sorry. I startled you. We need to talk. I need to talk to you. I went back to Worcester Road. I saw Annie. Let me tell you. You don't understand. I know that. I know she is dead. I know it. It is you who will not accept the fact, preferring to think of her in heaven. Snowy white wings and dancing with the angels. Is that your idea of honesty. You have to Emma, everything these was between us is gone. The boat is wrecked and sunk now. We have to hold to something else. Open this door Emma. The truth, how wonderful and extraordinary our daughter was.... I'm busy Annie. All right, come here, come here. Once there was a man Who, while travelling in South America, came apon a beautiful and dangerous idea. Here, here. Come on, come on then ...I wont hurt you. He knew his wife wouldn't care for this creature so when he came home he locked it in a box, where it couldn't run around and do any damage. But every so often he'd open the lid and feed it, just because he couldn't bear to let it die. One day he opened the box and discovered it wasn't in there at all. It had escaped with all its babies, who were nesting all over the house making a terrible mess. But finally they caught them all, and bundled them in a blanket and he asked his wife to dispose of them as she saw fit. I don't know but I fancy she took them out in the garden and set them free. Done. I have finally got it out of the air and into these pages. Will you read it and decide what must be done with it. I confess I no longer know and I am very tired. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted objects we can conceive directly follow. There is a grandeur in this view of life ...in which endless forms most beautiful and wonderful have been and are being evolved. Emma? Did you read it? And.... Dear Hooker, I have today despatched to John Murray the completed manuscript. Who knows if anyone will buy it and how they will respond. No doubt many will wish al diabolo altogether. But least it is out in the world now and no longer torturing me."
ticker,REILLY ,Tom Sizemore," Look who's talking, old man. I gotta get back on top.   Get off the sleaze detail. So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch. You don't fish. You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway? No thanks.   I got close but it never woulda worked. What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty. She didn't work out, had to cut her loose. She wanted to cook me breakfast. C'mon, let's check it out. Nah, let's just take a look-see. Ow!   Son-of-a-bitch. Yeah, just a nick ...  Drop it!  Tell them to drop it - now! Don't talk. It don't work- Captain...  Sir, I-- I want to work this. But sir-- Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton. I'll do it. I'm looking for the Bomb Squad. Where are they? Officer Reilly, vice. -Where? Thanks.  Bomb Squad. You the Bomb Squad?  Reilly, Vice. I- Who's in charge here? Look, it's important. It's about this. Off a girl's wrist.    A suspect... What? What do you mean? Thanks. Captain- A ticking bomb...  It's detonation cord, for a bomb. I'll do it. Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them. Yes, sir. We just got a bomb threat upstairs. A cop was killed last night interrupting a robbery. One of the gang was grabbed, a girl. The one I told you about with the detonation cord. Well, her friends just called in, they're threatening to waste people unless she's released in the next hour. We can start in the area where the robbery occurred. Captain assigned me to assist you. What're you talking about? We've got one hour.     Are you coming or not? Okay, fuck you. You touch me again and-- Sir... What was-?   Why...? What? Now wait just a fucking- Mike Reilly. What kind of bomb was it? Huh? So you're the ""Device Squad""... and you defuse ""devices""?  Anything else I should know? I'll get back to you. I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type. Where's the girl? The one I brought in. Any luck? Captain said I could give it a crack. She was my collar. Maybe I'll get lucky. But, if you got a problem with that, talk to the Captain. You remember me. You know, your boyfriend just killed a ten year old at a bus stop, blew her head clean off. You're scared. You're just caught in the middle. But, we've got a guy out there wasting people just to get you back. Why? It can't be because of your looks. So, I'll be honest with you - Let me be very clear about this. The police won't let you go. When your boyfriend realizes this, I have a feeling a lot of innocent people are going to die. Kids, families. I know you don't want that to happen. A what? She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before? Where...? All of you, shut the fuck up! No wonder the rest of the department doesn't want to work with you. You're nothing but a bunch of... punks. Hey, look-- Oh yeah?     Prove it. The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside. I don't know. You tell me? You mentioned something called Redstone. Cream of the crop, huh?   You? Sounds like terrorist heaven. Just how easy is it to build a... device? Girl was here. The guy in charge was over there with one of his men, the other one was back there. Bombers, what kettle of fish are they? Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along. Yep. Look, it's a longshot... Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?  You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches? T.J., what're you doing? Someone who smokes French cigarettes. `Til we get a better lead. Insurance? What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked. Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago. Still waiting for a miracle.   Go ahead. Quite a team you've got, where'd you find them? You guys seem pretty tight. Why do you do it? Looks like Pooch's doing okay. There he goes. He was here the whole time. Say, thanks for the back up--  You heard him, get the fuck away, it's a bomb! So cut both. Which one's which? No, I'm with you. You okay?  Nothing. Nothing traceable. Got work to do, don't we? Report on the case so far. Yes, sir. Mike.   No thanks, I'm fine. `Night... What? Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual. I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.  I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since. This was his. Doesn't work for shit, but it's keeping me straight. I terrible with mechanical things. It's working. Okay, hit it. Don't bet on it. How's the print coming? Damn. No thanks, Bev. Yes, sir. I didn't.     But I had to try. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Hello. But they weren't all insured. Who is he? Taylor's dead. Where are they, Mary? Thank you. Then why tell me? Be right back. Excuse me... I'm looking for two men who were staying at the hotel over there - one has a beard, the other's tall, thin. You wouldn't happen to have seen them, would you? No, of course not... well, thanks anyway. Here you go, Your Highness. You're beautiful! We're back in business! Glass, there they are. Pooch right in front of you, you got `em, you got `em. My God, you're going to use her, aren't you? I promised her she'd be safe. It won't work, he'll know it's a trap... I know. Glass--! C'mon, move it. Dispatch, this is Reilly. Patch me through to the Bomb Squad. Just do it. T.J., it's Reilly, put Glass on! Where you guys at? Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul. Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town. Would you? Me, too.  Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.  All units, suspect spotted heading down alley behind Grand Hotel.  We need back-up, now.  Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.  We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!  Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit! Fuck factor? What do we do? Talk to me.     Let's assess. C'mon, talk to me! We can do it! Nothing. Keep talking. Wires... metal, cold... something soft... More metal... sharp edge... Something round, two wires ... What's wrong? Make up your mind, trigger. Yeah, another round thing. Which one's which? What... ? How the hell do you feel yellow? Thanks. Thank you, Captain. Nice to be here."

It's a large department store, over a couple million in merchandise... stereos, jewelry. On three floors.  Horus, what do I do?  What do I do with him... when you're gone? I have to entertain this super... She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the participants. Aaron.  He comes home crying.  Oh, I forgot to make coffee. She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her. No, I'll make it right now. What're you doing? She's taken by this scene. About him? No. They're lying through their collective teeth. Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better... Have a good one. What were you doing in the street?  You ripped it pretty good. It'll be all right. It's just the seams. I can sew it back.  This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good care of it. Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for you, all right? Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.  Let's see. Come on, I want to see. I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain. Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his. He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls her hand away. The water is dirty.  It's not your fault. You should slow down. Rest.  It must be hard. To always do right... do good when all you want to do is rest. Where... who are you?  You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do. It's like, everything you say sounds... so perfect. Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way. I mean, not to say that it's insincere... So, you never answered. Back there... what were you doing in the middle of the street? You're still up? She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious. Nick's market. Are you sick? You want some milk? I'll heat it up for you, how about that? Yes, he is. He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues dressing - oblivious. Yes. What facts? He's not a hero. Aaron likes him. No. I have to start on dinner. So how about that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed. All right. Try to get some sleep. With that, she's out the door. Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his wretched face. He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean? Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the cover. All right, already. How's your mouth? Hold still. Shut up. Horus? Horus? She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into the stairway outside. There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.  Aaron, hold it. Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes. So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and bones. It SNARLS at Aaron. Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't let go of them. Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in him. Hancock? The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it. Your hair. Come on, have a seat. Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n homework. There... my hero. He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely. I started out just trimming for Horus. Here and there. He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a police captain there... in Philly. When we moved here, I pretty much took over as the resident barber. You know, to save some money. His father's idea. Not his. He went through it anyway, like he had something to prove... the validation of his manhood. Want? The hair... I need to... Yes? Why... what for? They're eye to eye. Close. Yes. Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah! All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him... You're leaving? I'm sorry. Really? On the boardwalk? I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought. Good night. What? Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox. Eat... and we'll go.  Where's your father? She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair. I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave. I'm sorry.  What? Is everything all right? Tell me what's wrong. He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into darkness. Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there? Hancock... what... Me? What can I do?  What do you want me to do? How? Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her. Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing her senses, pulls away. Don ' t. I can't. I love him. The death blow. I love him. I'm sorry. One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console... but what can she do? I'm sorry. Horus... What happened toyou? Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to your room. What do you think you're doing, Horus Longfellow? Horus gauges her. Horus, what're you talking about?  Who did this to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength. Why do you say that? L are. Did You're a fool, that's what you you think I was completely blind when I married you? Something cuts at your masculine ego and it's the pressure... the standard's unreasonable. The woman, she wants me to part oceans. That's the kind of bull shit's made of. I went w through it...,I was there when the hurt came, when the academy said no. I there. And when you felt like hiding... from me and your ownforward. taking Rent job, I stepped It was you, Horus Longfellow. otile. I didn't take the love away. here. the closet, Horus stands there - tears, almost. He takes to his security retrieving his U-Rent Security Jacket. He grabs hat. Straightens his hair. Puts it on. Horns, what are you doing? Inserts the flashlight into his holster. Horus!  ""Once there was a way, to get back homeward..."" once there was a way, to get back home..."" Her voice grips him. Torments him... ""Sleep pretty darling, do no t cry. And I will sing a lullaby..."" Sleep tight. She leaves. Aaron stops her by the door.  What're you doing? Hancock closes in. Corners her. Hancock, please. He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes out of fear for Aaron. Stay back, Aaron! Hancock takes her away - like booty. Aaron dangles from his cape, trying to save his mother.. In vain. The superhero springs into the night - with his woman. What're you doing? Please. But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his hand down her back and between her buttocks.  No... I'm cold.. Hancock does not respond. What have you dome? Horus! Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him.  It'll never go away. Hancock responds to ""it."""
saw,LAWRENCE ,Cary Elwes," Youre not dead.  Theres no point in yelling, I already tried it. Would if I could. I dont know yet. Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found something. No one can hear you. Calm down, just calm down. (He knows that to remain calm is to remain in control, something he must be no matter what the situation.) Are you hurt? Whats your name?nan Recognize him?  Well, do you have any idea how you got here? Whats the last thing you remember?  Well theres...theres not much to tell, really. (Across the room, Adam gives up with the chain for the time being but remains sitting on the floor.) I was on my way home from work and uh, I dont remember anything else. From the looks of these chains, someone didnt want us to go very far either. What? No one has taken your kidneys. Because youd either be in terrible agony, or youd be dead by now. Trust me. Yeah. (He sighs. Hes getting tired of Adam already. He speaks sharply.) So, you gonna tell me your name, or what?  That clock. Its brand new.  Wait, I think I may be able to reach that door. What is that? (Adam doesnt answer, continues looking at the tape. Lawrences voice grows impatient.) Excuse me. Where did you find it?  Come on, come on, come on.... No? Use your shirt. Your shirt. Come on...  Well, look around, there must be something else you can use. Well there must be something! Come on, you can do it. Come on, come on, again. Throw me the player.  Look, were going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. Now just throw it to me. Give me that. Now. (Adam tosses him the tape. He catches it, rewinds, plays back. Adam stands up from his spot on the floor.) Wait a minute. Shh, shh! Listen... There! Right next to you, on the toilet. Come on, come on. Anything? Take off the lid. (He points to the lid. Adam looks to it, slowly stands up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no patience.) Come on! Huh.  What is it? Hey! (Adam turns and looks. Lawrence speaks in an irritated voice) Mind passing me the other one?  He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. (Adam looks up at him, eyebrows raised.) I think I may know whos done this to us. Its not someone I know personally. Its...just someone I know of. The last I heard...the police still hadnt caught him. And the only reason I know that is because I was a suspect. Ill start from the beginning. The newspapers started calling him the Jigsaw Killer. Actually, technically speaking, hes not really a murderer. He never killed anyone. He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor extending across the midline. Started as colon cancer. (He turns back to the three young medical students. One of them, a pretty Asian girl named CARLA, smiles at Lawrence as he speaks, seems particularly infatuated with him.) The patient has come in for a standard checkup by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining. The patient had... Thank you for that information, Zep. (he looks to the students, who all share his smug smile) As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients. (Zep just stares at Lawrence, his expression mostly blank but with pure loathing just underneath the surface. The look seems to say Fuck you, Dr. Gordon. He stares at him for a moment, then turns away, and continues down the hall with his cart.) Continuing on, the patient.... Obviously someone doesnt want me to tell you what the patient has. Excuse me. (He steps around the students, leaves the room. The three students watch after him with great admiration.) Oh. Thank you, I do my best. (He sits in his chair. Tapp takes the seat next to Sing across from him. Sing studies him silently, chewing gum.) Thats fine. Now, how can I help you gentlemen?  Why is it that youre interested?  No, Im afraid thats...thats quite out of the question. I cant just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today, so... Im sorry, youll have to tell me again. What is this all about? Of course not!  I was seeing someone. I was visiting someone. It wasnt a patient. Alright? (He sighs, shakes his head. Hes fucked, either way.) What am I gonna do? That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder. Good! Can I go home now? Id like to help, really, but... Okay. You mean....he was alive? Yeah, Im sure.  Im in exactly the same situation youre in. What?  Thats not going to do anything. Well, you wont stop it. Thats why we cant cut through these chains. Its why you wont break that glass. (he gestures to the pipe then the glass) Every possible angle has been pre-thought out by him. (He appears deep in thought, starting to understand the set-up more so, figuring out the way this guy thinks. Almost admiring him. The situation may be bad, but its a brilliant design.) To overcome something, you have to understand what a perfect engine it is. Thats how you fight disease. (He looks up at the ceiling, at the walls, around the room) Now the tape told us to find an X. That X has to be somewhere in this room. Help me find it.  Ive been the last thing I said to my daughter.  Just a minute. Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph. Nope! Im done. (he smiles, turning to look at them.) See? (he pulls the covers up over her, up to her chest.) Theres no one in your room. Theres no such thing as the bad man. Now can you go to sleep? You are? Give me your tootsie. (He pulls back the covers and she pulls out her foot. He takes it in his hand.) Oh, what a big tootsie. (He turns to her, raising his eyebrows up) Remember this one? (He counts on her toes as he says the following) This little piggy went to market, this little piggy stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef, this little piggy had none, and this little piggy went Weeee! (he tickles up her leg to her tummy and she giggles) all the way home! Well I have to go to work, sweetheart. You know what Daddys job is like. Now, come on. (he re-tucks her in, she smiles at him.) Lets see. Try and get some sleep now, okay? (He gives her a kiss, smiles, stands up and goes to the door.) What? (He stops at the door, turns, goes back over to her bed, sits down next to her and leans over. This was the last thing hed expected her to say) What are you talking about? You mean, leave you and Mommy? (She nods; he reaches up and gently brushes her hair away from her face.) No, no sweetheart, I would never do that. Who gave you that idea? Well its not true, okay? How much do I love you? Thats right, thats right! (He gives her a kiss, pulls back.) Good night, sweetie. Tomorrow, Ill read you your favourite story. Okay.  What, what are you talking about? I am happy. Would you like to see her? (He reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to Adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up the wallet and opens it. He sees two pictures of Diana, side by side. The one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. The one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere. Thank you. Weve talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, its difficult enough to concentrate on one. (The tone of his voice indicates that maybe hes starting to realize that he shouldve spent more time and attention to his daughter.) Theres another picture behind the one youre looking at. (Adam reaches behind the photo on the right and pulls another photograph out. Lawrence smiles slightly as he speaks) Its my favourite one because were all in it together. Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means Im always missing from the photos.  What?  Really? Are you sure? He...he mustve taken it. I... I am happy. (He walks over to a chair, leaning over it as he puts something down, gets his briefcase ready to go to work. Alison stands a few feet behind him, trying her best to get him to react, to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade.)nannan  Look, Im sorry I cant be of more help to your investigation. X Marks the spot...(He stands, touching the pipe and looking up and around a bit.) X marks the spot...we need to search this room again. (He turns and looks over at Adam.) What are you doing over there? Excuse me? I really dont see the point in us not helping one another. Thats exactly why we need to talk. We need to think! Well then dont keep me in the dark about what youre thinking! What? Why? How come we didnt see that before?  The key, the one from my envelope. Where is it? Are you joking? Youre gonna put something we found in this room in your mouth? Im trying the police. (He flips open and dials on the cell phone, but a weird beeping noise indicating the call cant go through comes from the phone. He dials again, same result.) Shit.  This was meant to receive calls, not make them. (A moment; he realizes something.) Wait a minute...this has happened before. Last night, after I finished at the hospital. (fade into another closer shot of the cars, and Lawrence walking down the corridor, carrying his briefcase.) I was walking back to my car. (He stops a moment) I thought I was alone, but Im sure someone else was there. (He squints, bringing his hand up over his eyes. There is a flash from the side. He looks up, startled, looking in the direction in which he thinks it came from, but sees nothing. He looks around him for another moment, then continues forward to his car.)  That...thing. It was waiting for me. (He exhales sharply, then looks back up at Adam. Adam is just standing there, staring at him. Something seems a bit...off. With a suspicious tone, Lawrence addresses him.) How did you know to turn off the lights? Yeah, but how did you know? Instinct? You know what? (he looks down, then back up at Adam.) Youre a terrible liar.  What else arent you telling me? Just stop it. You knew to turn off these lights. Im dealing with a juvenile. Yeah! Oh God...(he turns it over, then back. Adam casts his eyes downwards, still standing but cooling off, feeling bad for Lawrence) W...where did you get this? W...why didnt you show me this before? What are you doing to them you bastard?! (He goes back to huddling over the photograph, sniffling and crying for a moment. Then, he sits up, trying to pull himself together) Okay...okay.. Okay, Ive got to think now...(He looks down, sees the note again in the box.)  Adam, listen to me. I want you to play along with me on this. You got that? (he turns the lights back on, both of them again wincing at the bright light. Lawrence glances at the surveillance camera, then looks to Adam. So you uh, still want that cigarette?  There! Ive done it! Ive killed him with the poison, just like you wanted. Now wheres my family?! Where are they?! What? What? (he rolls his eyes. Unbelievable. He speaks in a hushed tone.) That was our way out! Stop acting!  All right, thats it! (He leans over and picks up his saw, sits down and starts trying to saw through his chains again, grunting. Adam, in the meantime, just sits back against the wall, breathing heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues to franticly saw, but it doesnt work. He gets pissed off and throws the blade down.) Ah, Damn it!! Who is this? Diana? Yeah baby, its me. Im here. Dont worry honey, everythings going to be okay. Wheres Mommy?  Let me talk to her sweetie, okay? Put Mommy on. W...what man? Hello? Hello? Diana? Diana! Diana! Ally? Is that you? (We see a shot of Alison giving a threatening look through her tears to Zep.)  How do you know? Ally, what is going on?nan  My wife, she uh, she mentioned your name.  She told me...not to believe you.  Who are you? Stop the lies! Youre a liar! I need to know the truth! Thats because its the truth. But...why?  Youve uh, had these with you the whole time? Yeah, right. Youre so full of it! (He angrily crumples up and throws the photo he was holding at Adam) Why did you um, deem it necessary to page me when you knew I was at home? But I gave you a precise time at which to page me. (He puts the briefcase on a chair by the door then goes over and sits down next to her on the bed.) You cant do that. Look, it was wrong for me to makes you come here. -Please.  Im sorry. (He stands and heads over to the door. Carla remains sitting on the bed. She sniffles slightly but doesnt cry.) You tell anyone you were here? For me? Hello? I- (but the other person hangs up, and a dial tone is heard) I have to go. Ive got to go. (He picks up his briefcase from the chair, and heads out the door. Who was it? The person who paid you to follow me, who was it? What does that mean? Does that mean you saw what happened to me?  Clearly, whoever paid you to take the pictures of me is the one who put is in here. Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course it is! What did he look like? Was he tall, was he skinny, obese, what?  You must remember something about him. Youre telling me you dont remember a thing about the guy? Oh for fucks sake! I give up! Tapp! (shot of inside Adams apartment, Tapp handing us/Adam money. Adams/our hand reaches out and takes it quickly. Then, back to Lawrence) Detective Tapp! No, no, he was discharged from the police force. (Shot of Tapp at his desk with the Amanda video, looking at notes.) He broke down after his partner was killed (Tapp and Sing sitting next to each other in Lawrences office), but that didnt stop him from harassing me. (Lawrence sitting in the car next to Tapp) The guy became obsessed. (Tapp in his current apartment adjusting the camera in the window, then a shot of him leaning over a notebook, going over notes.) Hes convinced himself that I must have somehow been involved with the murders. Hes...hes crazy. (Tapp at the corner desk in his apartment, giving a crazy-sounding Heh heh heh laugh. The shot cuts back to Lawrence, who points accusingly at Adam.) And you helped him.  You took money from him to invade my privacy. How could you do that? Right, right. You know what Adam? Youre not a victim of this game, youre a part of it. (Points accusingly at him as he says this.)nan I did not cheat on her!!! How did I get here? (Adam sits down on the pipe in his corner, leaning forward a bit.) I had...I had everything in order. (he lays down on his side, facing Adam, who watches him with sympathy) My whole life was in perfect order. (He holds up and looks at the picture of Alison and Diana gagged.) No. I know him. (We see the photo as well. It is a shot looking up into Lawrences window, with Zep standing there, looking out, completely unaware of his picture being taken.) Zep! (Cut to a shot of Zep listening. The shot goes back and forth between him as his eyes widen while Lawrence makes his threats.) His name is Zep. Hes an orderly at my hospital. (his voice becomes a growl, furious) Zep. You perverted little psychopath. Im gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this! You bastard fuck!  Is that you Zep, you bastard!? (Adam gets up from his corner, moves forward slightly) I know its you, you son of a bitch!  Ally?  Hello? Hello? Ally! Honey, are you all right? I dont know. Im being held captive in a room somewhere. Im so sorry, Ally. Im sorry for everything. Its my fault. Please forgive me. Ive always been happy with you. Ally! Ally! (Adam watches him with wide eyes.) He...he electrocuted me... FUCK THIS SHIT!! No!!!! (He lowers his head and cries loudly.) I cant be calm! My family needs me! No, God! (He cries and screams, still cant get the phone. He quickly turns and sits up, grabbing the chain and pulling it as he lets out a terrible scream of rage. Adams hands are up clutching his head, trying to keep his cool but having a very hard time.)  You have to die.  Im sorry... My family...(he aims and pulls the trigger, hitting Adam in the upper chest area. Adam falls down forward onto the floor, his screams stop.) Ive done it! Now show them to me! (he continues to cry, dropping the gun next to him, collapsing back down with his forehead to the floor.) You bastard! Ill fucking kill you! (Lawrence grabs Zeps leg as he passes but is too weak and Zep pulls away, looking down at him, moving over to the other side of the body) Ill fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! (Lawrence quickly cralws forwarrd and takes up the gun, pulling the trigger several times, but there are no more bullets. It just clicks.) Ill fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! Ill fucking kill you! Ill fucking kill you! Why? Youre going to be all right. (Adam stops sobbing for a moment) Youre just wounded in the shoulder. I have to go and get help.  Dont...Dont worry, Ill bring someone back, I promise. (He continues crawling on, out the door while Adam watches him pathetically, still crying and reaching out for him.)"
fletch,FLETCH ,Chevy Chase," So what do you figure? FAT SAM No idea. FLETCH No idea at all? FAT SAM Okay. Some idea. FLETCH Like when? FAT SAM Like tonight. FLETCH For sure? FAT SAM No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some $hit? FLETCH I think Id rather have drugs. Maybe tonight? That's what he said. I don't know how he doesn't know.He doesn't know. Wonder who his supplier is. I wasn't asking. I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy. Creasy, how old are you?  You're not taking real good care of yourself. What? Why not? Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind? I think you've got the wrong gal, fella. Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner? Nugent. Ted Nugent. Charmed. I always liked this part of town. What a coincidence. I came this close...  ...to buying this place Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me. Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange. I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that. I commend you on your Spanish. Ahh, the library. Masculine but sensitive. Really, I love what you've done with the place. Must have cost you...hundreds. I'm all ears. You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk. Why don't you try suicide? So why pick me? Maybe I'm just on vacation. Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you? I'm still here. Wouldn't they normally be locked? I have the same problem with my help. I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy. A .357. So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.  What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first. I don't think you'll have to worry about that. Sure, all drifters do. Take it where? Where am I going? They serve dinner on the flight? You've certainly thought this out, haven't you? You sure those doors will be open? The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying. You sure got the hard part. Sure. Thank you so much  Hey, Larry! Can I steal you for a minute? Deal. Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor. Don't say shoot, okay. Did you hear something? Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away. W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute. Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit? Uh, almost.  And a damn fine one, I might add. Two.... Oh, I hate it when he calls me that. I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay? I never read the paper. What's the spread on the game tonight? Looks great. 'Shame of Our City' is so good. Why not? Oh $hit...really? Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it. Practically. I have pictures of him. Dealing.... He's not the story! There's a source behind him. Well, there we're in a gray area. I'd say charcoal. Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope. 'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.' 'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'  Spot right here. Thanks. Maybe. '...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen. I wonder if that's his doctor. We play tennis at the club. Yes. Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains. That's Babar. One. B-a-b-a-r. But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant. I don't know. I don't have any. No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books. Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt. Mrs. Smith. Right. Margaret. Is she ever. I've got some stories....  It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly. Sure, but the end was so sudden. Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy. Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that.... Honest, I feel fine. You better be married. Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time? Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family. Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?  Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right? I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you? I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove? Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant. It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place? Right. Fine.  Not recently. Uh, I'm not really prepared. My hands aren't sterilized. Where am I? I'm fine. Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding. Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother. It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image. Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something. Thank you. My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it. That's it?  This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.  He'll be so relieved. Christ. What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that? I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside. One on one? And the foul.  She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it. It stinks. I thought woman were independent now. Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this. She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that.... My lawyer was a bum. I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too. Are you serious? Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.  I think I just won a million dollars!  Damn...lost again. Sorry. Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month. Thank God. Gail Stanwyk!  I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great. Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours. We used to fly together. I'm...John. John Ultrarelamensky. It's Scotch-Rumanian. So were my parents. Please. Yes, I'm with the Underhills. They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis. Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich. You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan? Preoccupied with what? Good. Lobs are a very important part of the game. Why do you keep doing this? Try stepping into the ball with your left foot. There, much better. I have this effect on lots of women. Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?  I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.  I'm such a heel. How'd you guess? You are a rich woman. What's he doing in Utah?  ...then who walks in but George Bush. He took one look around the room...  ...and said 'Sorry Mr. President, I thought it was Saturday.' I thought I was going to die. Thank you. Okay. First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --- Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats. I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?  God I admire you. Comanche Indian.  Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick? Yeah.  Frieda's boss.  My secretary. Larry, it's me.... See if you've got anything in Stanwyk's background from when he lived in Utah. Also check on a realtor in Provo named Swarthout. And tell Frank I'm crazy about him and I'd like to discuss his maybe moving in with me. Later. They're after Gummy again. It's weird. Hey, what are you doing? You don't have to run with me, Crease. Why are you beating up on that kid? He's defenseless, and you kick the crap out of him. What do you want from --- What goddamn right do you have to take him?  They didn't do anything. I busted their window, they didn't do anything. Not luck. They don't want me. Gummy and two cops.... Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here. I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow? She needs me, Frank. That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while. All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this. Yeah.  More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank. Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures. I have some ideas. Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt. Nothing to it. Hi, Jim Swarthout, please. Oh, hello, my name is Igor Stravinski and I'm looking for some ranch property. No, I just heard some people at the club talking about the property you sold him, and the way it was described, three million sounded like a pretty good price.  What? Are you sure?  Of course. I guess I was misinformed. Listen, I'd love to come out and see you anyway. When are you available? Tomorrow.  What's your name fella? Fluff? Pom-pom? Sh*t.  Sit-tuh! Roll over. Play dead. Good boy. You any relation to Doctor Dolan? I hate this. Make sure nobody comes in, okay? So much for your three million dollar ranch. Suck on this Cujo! Gimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one...  Everything's fine, now...go take a little nap.... Look! Defenseless babies! That dog is such an A**hole. 'Bil-lie, Bil-lie...' If I took that out, you guys couldn't fit in here. You just planted that. Read me my rights. Hold it! I'll waive my rights. I hear he's mellowed a lot since he came out of the closet. You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you? Fletch. Fletch F. Fletch I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation. Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probaly explains the curious feeling of love I have for you. It was planted on me, sir. 'Your men' might just be involved in all this.  Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great. I don't like Tommy Lasorda. You can't keep me here. I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights. My God, you're serious. Can I ask anybody now? Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her. I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you? Not a prayer. Not at all, Chief. But next time...no tongue, okay? How could you call him? It's also called getting me this close to being murdered. He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story. You'll have it.  Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.  Print this Frank. Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk? Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six? One. I would, actually. Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?  I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor? Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one. This is just the nicest place. It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky. Hi. I was hoping you'd say that. Can I borrow your towel for a minute? I ordered lunch. Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be. No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today. Here, take mine. Yes. Lunch.... Come on in. No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill. Sierra del fuego.  I saved his life during the war. No. He was. I got him out. 'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes....' 'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching....' 'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.' Can I ask you a question? Are you still in love with Alan? Why'd you let me in? Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan? Good point. What about his parents? How come? Thanks for the great time. Long story. Take one end. I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him. Yeah.  Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding. Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe. So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth. That's what I want to know. He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true. He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad. Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout? Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush. You saw a forgery. That's the real deed. Now, if this were at all legible, you'd believe me. Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented.... I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true. I'm really sorry I have to tell you all this. No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me. Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan? I'll take you to a game. I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.  Act natural. If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay? Jesus. Should've known. Goddamn it. Great. First I'll get a speeding ticket, then they'll shoot me. Terrific. All right, fella, smog check. Move over. Sorry, youngster, but we have to see what kind of fluorocarbons this thing puts out at ninety-five. Don't worry about the speed limit. That's what the police escort's for. Holy sh*t. Okay, kid. Just stand here with your hands on the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee. Here, take my hat.  Hello. I'm with the hotel catering. Are you enjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked? Thank you, Tony, thank you. As a lifelong friend of....  ...Fred Dorfman, I'm thrilled to be here. Many of you are probably not aware of Freddie's lifelong commitment to honoring a profession that frequently goes unsung -- the police. Many times Fred used to forsake a night with his wife and children to go out an sell tickets for the Policemen's Benevolent Association. Our men in blue are with us today, and I think we should all extend a shake of the hand, a slap on the back and a 'howdy' to them. When was the last time you hugged a cop? Do it for my good friend Tommy Lasorda. Doesn't it feel good? Don't you wish you'd done it long ago? Let them know how we feel, with a song. For every cop on every beat in every city of this great nation.  'For he's a jolly good fellow....'  Everybody!  'For he's a jolly good fellow....' You're kidding.  So he's going. Uh...are there any other tickets charged to the same account? Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and...is there anyone in the seat next to me? Never heard of him. Thanks anyway. What? Oh, thanks. 'Bom-ba-bom-bom...bommmm.' The door was unlocked. No wonder. I commend him on his choice. I commend him on his choice I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh. Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's. Where is she? She moved out? I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything. So you're saying she moved out. This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over. Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon. I'm her cousin. Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first. I'm getting real tired of all this hostility. Evening.  They oughta recall these things. One bump,the whole window goes.  Are you Mr. Marvin Stanwyk? I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters. My parents were great fans of the former President. Sure did. Dropped the big one on them. Right. I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub-insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son. California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions? First, a couple of routine things: are you and you wife currently alive? Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named.... Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation? Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when? Ten days ago? Isn't that nice. Since when? Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo. Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy. I'm sorry? You've met her? Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh? Has he? Then he has. Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?  Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife? And they're still married...Alan and Sally Ann. How long have they been married? Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to ---  No, thank you. Frank told you that? You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank. Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar. 'welluh bless my soul whatsuh wrong with me? I'ma itchin' like a man Inuh fuzzy tree....' Yeah...No kidding. The Marriott at LAX. Sonofabitch...Checked in this morning. Great. Thanks a million. And call Gail Stanwyk at the Racquet Club. Tell her I have to meet her tonight. Eight o'clock at the club. Urgent and confidential. Thanks. Question: Question....  What's wrong with my life? Question: Why does a man marry a millionaire's daughter in Beverly Hills if he is already married to a girl who lives in a crappy one bedroom apartment in Utah? Answer: Three million dollars. Big Question: What's with Stanwyk and Cummings? I don't know. Bigger Question: Why does Stanwyk want me to kill him?  Biggest Question: Why do I eat this sh*t?  Miss, I believe this has already been eaten. What's wrong, Gail? No. I think you better sit down. Gail, please. I got this from Alan's parents. By the way, they see him all the time. I checked. There was no divorce. I'm telling you he's not your husband at all. And they're leaving the country tomorrow night. I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow. You cant do that. They're trying to kill me! You're going to have to trust me, Gail. You have to. Now listen to me: he's expecting you to go to your meeting tomorrow night. Do it. Stay out of the house. Come here. Gum? I'm the Sufi. Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk. Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum. Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy. Sit back down. Fat Sam is turning state's evidence. He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling. Sure you did. Twenty years. Can't do a thing with this robe. One more question, Gum...don't look at me. Where does the Chief get the drugs? Rio de Janeiro, maybe? That's Brazil. Wait here for me, Gummy. It's the only way you'll be safe. Believe me. You don't know me. I'm serious, Sam. Affirmative. Affirmative. For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy game me a deposition. I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --- You don't have a piece of the action?  Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that. What? Gum thought Brazil. I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight. This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship. I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me. Forget it. I'm going to write the story. Just hold the last couple of paragraphs till ten o'clock tonight.  Make yourselves comfortable, guys, but don't leave the office. You were going to can me, right? Not really? I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward. I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?  Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe. Read this, please. Cut the crap and read it.  Unless my people hear differently, this letter goes out at midnight. Pretty hefty. Keep reading. You shouldn't be here. He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan. Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.' 'By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler, but you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper. Sincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.' The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together. How similar in build you and I are. then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up. Whoops. That is a lighter, isn't it?  Thank God, the police. Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay? Whoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk over, so we'll go catch the last ten minutes of Dynasty. ...with your money.  Go ahead. Make my evening. I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them. Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.  You sure did. Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but...any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought. I gotta go, Lar. Right. Gee, I must have been sh*t-faced at your wedding, I don't ---  What are you doing here? No problem. Basketball, of course, was invented in France, and is played with a large ball, two tongue depressors and a fish...."
batman,VICKI ,Kim Basinger," How'd you know it was me? A nice, restful vacation. I do get hurt. Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal here. What's new and hot in Gotham City?  Evildoers, huh? Big or small? Speaking of which... I hear the notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.  No. Yes, but please -- be gentle. Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.  I'm quoting. All over the world. They say he spends most of the year overseas -- until recently, anyway. Just what I've heard. Rich. Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.  Women find him magnetic. That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks. That's intriguing. They haven't been published yet. Don't mind my friend. He's a little nervous tonight. This is an amazing house. I'd love to shoot it sometime. As far as I know. Oh. Sorry. I was thinking. Yum, yum. I get it. Bruce Vain. Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne. Peanuts? Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research. I told him yes. You're awfully sweet to be concerned, but it's really not necessary. I'll call you, okay? Do you sail? You do a very convincing imitation.  Mm, this is tasty. What's yours? ... Ginger ale? ... I guess I needed a change. Have you ever been to Corto Maltese? We went there once when I was little. I played on the beach. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced with my father on the hotel patio.  That was Corto Maltese. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away. ... Terror. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I know it all seems a million miles away, out here on the water, with all this -- Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you. I'm happy to talk about something else. I don't want to be depressing. I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are you like this with the other women you know? -- Because I just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation. -- but it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even -- God. You would.  Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment. ... We could try that. I didn't mean to scare you. I just had to come in here and see it that was really you singing.  ""Don't buy sugar -- you just have to touch my cup."" Come on. ""You're my sugar --""  Bruce, you are such a case. Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is. -- Now you'll have to kill me. Poor thing. You should stay off that horse. ... To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.  Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner. Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so much like someone I used to...  Bruce? I know this is silly, but -- you're not married, are you? All street mimes should be executed. BRUCE!! Please tell him... I'm not trying to make his life difficult. I'd just -- I'd just like to know what's going on. Oh my God... I've seen this picture. His face. Allie, look at his face. Oh, Bruce... Alexander, you are on drugs. You're pissing me off, Allie. I know exactly why you're doing this. He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would know. Alexander... I know you. This is pointless. I'm leaving. Not to me. I need a job. Then ""everyone"" must know something I don't. I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here? ... Thank you. And you want a -- Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup. I've seen worse. Much worse.  ... Why the mask? You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her! I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead. -- GET AWAY FROM ME!! NO! WHICH CAR? ... Oh. Look! Police! Shouldn't we -- What about her? What about the girl? Can't we -- ... A hundred and eight? Well -- I think you might consider thanking me. You were good as dead. I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you. I won't let you have it. I know you can break my neck and take it. But the Joker's on that same roll. I -- Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures. How do I know you won't keep them all? ... Where are you going to take me? ... How long have I been out?  Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. What's that? I meant to ask you. Up on the roof -- how did you know my name? I'm serious. How did you know? What is this stuff? Kevlar? It doesn't protect your head, though. How'd you find this place? I don't like bats. Not that kind. Who pays for all this? The computers? No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll all be showing our true faces now. Wait. You can just tap into any corporate database you want? Anywhere? You could've killed him, you know. You could have killed the Joker. ... Bruce? Yes, Bruce -- I'm here -- Well, Bruce... I don't think... that would be possible. I, uh... I just can't -- But he's not. He's not crazy. Allie... he wants to tell me. That's why he took me there. Because he's trying to tell me. He has to tell someone. And I'm the one. He's trying to tell me.  ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it.  I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- ... So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you? I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne. You're one man. You can't save everybody. Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself. Oh, God. I've got to have some coffee or something. BRUCE! It's just like the last time. He sent me a present before he -- Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you. ""It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make up. I'll need you soon."" -- Whew. ... Where are you calling from? I'm sorry, she hung up. What are -- How can you do that if she's already off the line? What now! I'm not frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you. Yeah. Deja vu. ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!! Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's got the balloons rigged with compressor tanks!! LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allie -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him! You okay?  God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever -- ALLIE!! I loved you too. I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.  I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I -- I guess you did it, didn't you. You saved everyone.  Almost."
storytelling,TOBY ,Paul Giamatti," Hello, is this Pam? Toby Oxman. Oh, fine. How are you? Great! That's what I was gonna ask you. Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do... So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it? Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on. Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that. Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out. Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing. Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished. I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity. I'm a documentary filmmaker. N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers? Oh, I don't remember that... Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then... Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point. I work in a shoe store right now. But it's cool. I'm not ashamed. I mean, really, I have a much stronger sense of self now. And, uh, anyways, it's really very temporary. Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies. Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'? Yeah...So you're um...you're married? Huh. Kids? How many? Great. How old are they? Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary! Yeah, sure.  Maybe she has caller ID. Well, sir...uh...I'm actually not doing this for the money. When you make a documentary, you do it for many reasons, but money is certainly not one of them. Well, sir, a lot has happened to the landscape of the suburban high school since I was a student, and I feel it would be a valuable, perhaps even enlightening endeavor, to chronicle the changes, to get intimate with the realities kids and parents face in American schools today. Excuse me, where's the bathroom? No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker? Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact. Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine. Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it. Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel. HBO and MTV have also shown some interest. You see, we're trying to do a film on suburban lifestyles... ...kind of An American Family for the new millennium... Oh, it is. I mean You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today. Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds. Well, I suppose I could reconceive... 'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope... Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience. Mr Livingston, I fully understand and I share your concerns. You fell vulnerable. And I know that this is a very difficult question, but what it comes down to is: can you make a leap of faith in me, in the same way that I have to make a leap of faith in you? Walking down these hallways just like the ones I once walked down as a teenager, I couldn't help thinking back to a time when every day I woke up depressed, suicidal, consumed by despair. Had things changed? Was the competition to get into the most prestigious schools still a requisite rite of passage? Beneath these masks of courtesy and friendliness I knew that there were darker forces at work...and I knew that Scooby was the key to revealing the truth... Scooby, Scooby, Scooby...What are you thinking? College, SATs, your parents, your brothers, your friends...How is it you deal with all this stress? Is that right? Oh, my God... So whaddya think? I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is. Yes, I do. I love them! Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper. So are you surprised that Scooby took the SATs after all? OK. How about you, Cheryl? Were you surprised? Hmm.  I don't know...That's interesting, though. A cool car. Is that something that's real important to you, Brady? When the sky is clear and the sun is warm, you're reminded of how beautiful things can be: a lamp post, a sign, a straw wrapper blowing in the windBut when that dark cloud appears, you realize how fragile the balance of life is. But what about Scooby? How would this effect him? What meaning is to be found in this? You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry? Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining. No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time? Nothing, I guess OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this. OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types. Hip alternative types who will understand the process better Well, I need to see this with an audience! I don't know. Maybe they'll like it. So where'd you get in?  But what did you get on your SATs? But what kind of pull did you have? Let me try it, let me try it.  It's umThe button is just stuck. Uh, yeah, we're getting there. Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know. ...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism? What is most important to you? Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college? Yeah. He went to Harward. Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry..."
machete,ELEKTRA ,Nah," Jesus, Sis. How long have you known this one? Twenty minutes? I'm trying to. I've got to get ready for work. And you're in my room. What a charmer. You sure know how to pick `em, Sis. Sure thing. I like a man who takes control. You're under arrest, dick. Yeah, this is Agent Elektra Rivers, Homeland Security. I could use some unis at the corner of Newning and Drake for an assault. Suspect in custody.  Yeah. Thanks. I gotta get dressed now. Suit yourself. You too, slut. Hey, turn that up, would you? I'm watching it. What do you know? I'm gone, relax. Elektra Rivers, Department of Homeland Security. DHS has jurisdiction over everyone so give it a rest, Mr-- I appreciate that, sir, and I ASSURE YOU-- Is the shooter known to you, I mean, did you have any warnings or communication before today? My expertise is in profiling and assessing risks of potentially dangerous individuals who are in this country illegally. Would you like additional DHS officers assigned to your security detail? Here's my card, in case you change your mind. Or you think of anything else. Good. Now I can get some answers. McGraw? McGraw, are you here? Goddamnit! You're fucking my sister? Fuckin' liar. Did you at least get me the files? Well, where the hell are they? RNewman / Endeavor Draft 37. Never mind. I see `em. If you need me, I'll be in the bath. Slut.  ""Problems with authority. Prone to violence. Fatalistic, ruled by a sense of destiny and purpose.""  ""Father was a preacher who butted heads with the local drug baron.""  ""Inherited sense of destiny from father.""  ""Subject was the first to find him.""  ""Subject developed Old Testament- style concepts of vengeance at an early age. Sense of righteousness."" RNewman / Endeavor Draft 42.  ""Subject's macabre killing methods traced to childhood tragedy.""  ""Recommendation: Total lockdown."" No. But I read the ghost's file. My local contact Mcgraw got it from the hot sheets down south. Ex-boyfriend. Whatever. He's dangerous. I'm working on it. You want me to put this background on the air? You can put the gun away. I'm not going to give you any trouble. Homeland Security. I guess that makes you a terrorist. Come on. Give me some credit. It's not every ex-Federale-turned- assassin that has a local priest on the family payroll. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 54. So are you going to tell me why you did it? Destiny, maybe? A job? Who hired you? The undocumented workers' union? Sonofabitch. Can you prove that? What? Why? ""Feelings of righteousness and purpose."" Sure thing, Boss. Sonofabitch! What the fuck, man? My gun! You're shot. Let me bring you to a safehouse. I can negotiate your safety. We'll bring Booth down together. You want onions?! Oh shit, you're delirious, dying. Don't die please. What? What do you do with... What, is this some ""old Aztec"" shit that's supposed to heal you? What do I do with this? Wait, you want this gunk squirted in there...I don't... I....can't. Fuck. Ahhhh! That was disgusting. Do you mind not breaking knives in the house? It's kind of one of my rules. I mean... Oh shit. All right. I'm going to tell him what you told me. Wish me luck.  Yeah. I had a little fender bender. Calm down! I have him right now. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 59. Yes, but it's complicated. He's innocent. Sort of. Just listen. Michael Booth orchestrated the assassination attempt on McLaughlin's life. That's right. This was all some kind of hare-brained scheme to call off the ethics investigation. I think I can get Machete to testify. What? I came back to look for you, and I found him like... this. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 67.  ""The more things change--"" That's what my Grandma used to say. I'm sorry. Not me. I'm out. But others will. They don't care about Booth. They just want to wipe you out. You're an embarrassment to the feds. I guess I am, too. You could have killed me. I want to help you. First things first, I need a drink. Shit my heel is broke. It's nice having a man around. It's been a while. How long awhile you ask? Well, About two years. Oh that got your attention? Hmm, Actually you're better than my last boyfriend. He never listened. I don't know why I got so desperate. Don't want to grow old alone I guess. You ever get that feeling you're alone and that you'll never meet that one person... Are you listening to me? Give me that bottle. So what happens now, when you get him, that's it? It's over? Did you hear that? Stay here. Oh wow...is that a machete in your pocket or... I'm gonna fuck your brains out old man! Wow that was... Oh my god...did I wake the neighbors? This is one of ours. He works for the agency. My friend and I need a little help. Shit. I don't even want to know who she's fucking now. Fucking shit, bitch. Make him pay for a goddamn hotel. Sis? What's your name? I called in some favors. Look at this. All the right papers; a real identity. You could start over, be a real person. Where will you go? I'll ride with you. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 85."
foxcatcher,MARK ,Channing Tatum," Why do I do it? Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? Why do I do it? In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. Does anyone know why? Because that's where the Olympic games are. Does anyone know what this is? Olympic gold medal. I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics.  Would you like me to win another one? Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? Who here wants to see the two brothers win again? Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got. And this is for the trophy case. For the trophy case.  With the trophies. I'll have a # 4. No. Can I get extra meat on that? What are you talking about? Where's it say that? I always get extra meat. Every time I come here. Coach Teller? This is Mark Schultz-- I won a freestyle wrestling gold medal at the `84 Olympics. I'm arranging a clinic in your area next weekend, and I wanted to invite you and some of your wrestlers to join... That's Dave, my brother. I wrestle at 180... No, he won't be there, just me... Okay - well, good luck with your season, coach. Yes, there's a small fee. S-C-H-U-L-T-Z.... A unique, character-building opportunity for young wrestlers.... Yes, a small fee... Dave's my brother... Olympic Champion... Dave's my brother... Talked to some coaches. Why? I'll check. You said Saturday or Sunday? Saturday could work. Seoul's the goal. The minute you step on the mat, you are exactly who you are. You can't hide. You can't pretend you trained harder than you did, you want it more than you do. My brother Dave and me care about this more than we care about anything. The difference between the number one guy in the world and the number four guy is paper thin. The one who wins is the one who wants it more, who's willing to sacrifice, who can take the pain. I can take the pain. My brother Dave can take the pain. Can you take the pain? I talk about all this in my instructional videotape - which you can purchase at the end of the day for a nominal fee. You been calling me and hanging up? Sorry about your nose. You win a gold medal for them. And still. Nothing. No respect. Yah. It's Mark. Okay... Who do you work for again?  What does he want to talk about? Uh-huh. Oh. Yes, sir.  They said it was the library. Mark Sch -- Thank you, sir. I'm proud of that day.  To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk. Yes sir, it is. Oh. Well. I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ? - I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice. Yes sir. Pretty much. - Thank you - It's the world championship.  I want to be the best in the world. I started kind of late - high school sophomore. I was... well, truthfully, I was... kind of lost. And I got into it `cause my brother was wrestling. He convinced me to give it a try. I never told him this, but I was scared of losing in front of him. So of course my first match I get put up against a kid two years older. Dave was helping coach from my corner... and at the end, when the ref raised my hand... there was my brother, he was running towards me - screaming - laughing - he lifted me up -- It's always been his sport. He let me inside. I'm just lucky to be very very good at it. 25 thousand a year. He said name your price and I said the highest price that came into my head. We'd get to hand-pick our own team, wrestlers we want to work with - No - I mean... when I say we, I mean - you and me... could choose a team. Together. As soon as you meet him you'll understand. He sees what we're after. He cares about America - old family, basically paid for the Revolutionary War - he gets it. He wants to help us win, help restore our pride. No, not.... This country's pride. Dave - this is it. This is what we've wanted our whole lives - just to train - you and me - not to have to deal with USA Wrestling, or Harper and his corrupt university program - not to have to think about anybody else... I'm speaking to my brother, that okay with you? Why does she... The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing... The Worlds are sixty days away.  Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. They'll pull the plug on that. So. Dan Bane could come. I - I guess Dan Bane.  I don't know how to do this without you. Does it? Do you?  A spot's always open for you if you decide to come. Hi. I'm Mark Schultz. I'm here to see John du Pont? Yeah. Well - not today exactly, but, yes. This week. Sometime. In the meantime can I use the -  Is he? He's in there? Thanks. Yes. That's right. Sounds okay. That could be a good policy. Yes. Of course. I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster.  I've been making phone calls. Twenty-seven. Oklahoma University. Yes. Yes. No.  No. Two. No. Mr. du Pont. Yes sir, I drove straight down. Great. All right. Thank you, sir. No. I didn't realize he was married. Has he always lived with his mother? Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you FOR - You wrote this? Thank you. Do you want to come in? - The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there- Not even. 54 days. Drop! DROP -  Sir, you need me for something?  Pair up. On the mat. Up and down. Popper, Springer, let's go. Go! No, thank you. I'm good. Gecko? Great wrestler. What do you want to know? Anti-what?  I will. How do you mean? Right. Look. Dave's... he's got a good situation going up in Madison. He's... he doesn't want to uproot. The family. Just at the moment.  At the present time. Mr. du Pont, I don't... you can't buy Dave. I wasn't... I didn't realize you wanted him to coach. Right to left. I'm pretty sure that's John's mother. Dave. Dave. Come meet Mr. du Pont.  I told him how excited you were to meet him. What? Dave, check out the tape I have on NANEV - I want to show you this downblock - Too difficult to come say hello to Mr. du Pont? It's John du Pont. One of the most generous men in America. He's gonna save USA Wrestling.  Can you not do that in here? Smoking. I wrestle tomorrow. I'm trying to get advice from my brother, get ready for the finals - You start smoking - ? - Your kids are in here - What the hell is that? I'm not the one frigging smoking. I don't want to let you down. You don't have to do this. Thank you, Coach. Yes. Yes, I did. I...  It's not gonna happen. He got offered a contract extension at Wisconsin, Team USA wants him to train Olympic wrestlers next summer, he - it's not gonna happen. Of course I - I do -  Do you think that's true? Because... all these years - If that's what - Uh - well - not all that much - Okay... You good with this? Kneeled now? On the floor.  Really? It won't look... Read it?  John Eagle du Pont, highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila... ... highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila... Stamp collector, and former pentathlete. Mr. Du Pont will be making his return to competitive sports in the over-50 category at the Masters' League du Pont Wrestling Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona this March. I'm so proud to introduce my mentor. He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life. He knows how to motivate me. I feel his love for me as an athlete and as a human being. My mother and father were divorced when I was two years old. I spent a lifetime looking for a father... and I found one in the Golden, uh... the Gold Eagle of America - John du Pont. Ready? Go. Okay. Let's try it again. Yeah. I'm good. Yeah.... All good. Yeah. No, I'm kind of giving myself a bit of a break right now. I'll ramp it up again as the trials come closer.  Just a sec... No, I wasn't - listen, I gotta run - I just - I gotta run. I will - - Yeah, well - - I will. I gotta roll - Looking good.  Looking tough. I think you're ready.  We just need some more talc. Yah! I think you're ready. You've done the training, you learned the moves. You're ready to rumble, boss.  It's nothing. We all have demons. When Dave's son, Alex, was born he had some problems with his lungs. It looked like he wasn't gonna live. I was sitting in the hospital waiting room, and all I could think was: Maybe it's better if he dies. Dave won't be distracted. We can get back to training together.  Alex is fine now and, you know, he's my nephew. I'm not proud I wanted him to die, but it's the truth. That's just the truth.  You gotta conquer your demons.  Yeahhhhh!!!! When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. Be aggressive. Show him who's boss.  Hi, Boss. How you doing? Any soreness from the match? Yeah, no, exactly - we've got an intense workout scheduled this afternoon. Real intense one. So we're taking the morning to rest up. Well, I mean, I am.  On what? John, seriously, I don't know how else to say it. It's not gonna happen. You can't buy Dave. It's just not gonna happen. Hello?... Hello? I need to see John. Stan, please. I need to see him.  Listen - I - something happened. There was a - misunderstanding. I think I did something wrong and I really need to talk to him about it- Oh, uh - Yeah, of course. Just... just give me a minute. Hey, Dave. Good. I'm good. Yeah. I'm just concentrating. Trials are in 50 days. How they doing? I will.  I will.  Please don't do that.  - Please. I'm asking you to not...  Need to study up. Fix some weakness. Pretty much.  Nothing's going on.  What does that mean?  The fuck you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm done. It's over. I'm done. You lost. I lost. It's over. Tomorrow morning? 7 O'CLOCK - I'll pick you up tomorrow, 7am. Wait - your house, right?  What's going on? What -? Were you in the Big House yesterday? In the afternoon? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house.  What were you doing there? About what? He's weakening me. I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. He says they're expanding the program. There'll be room for both of us in the fall - - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend - - SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning - - I can't do this anymore. I can't do it - - John's killing me here - - If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after - You're not thinking of staying here...?  My own life. And you'll be here. What's on your forehead? It says kids. What does that mean? When are you gonna you see your own forehead? You've talked about this?"

The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering. True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions.  Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death - these are surferings. The causes of suffering arise from true sources.  Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth - these are some causes of suffering. We will have to think about that. I need to squeeze this brain. When one understands that he causes some of his own suffering, needlessly, then he looks for the causes in his own life. I need to jump! I love to jump! Oh, nicely done, Norbu.  I will get you.

Not trade, not defense. We will be lost. What should I do about my doubt, Teacher? I mean, my doubt.  Why me? Am I Him? I believe we must make no concesions to the Chinese.  But, I am one voice. The Dalai Lama has always trusted in the forces of Buddha.  Let us consult the protective deities. Enter. Yes. What is the size of our army, now? Has anyone died? One man.  A man has died. One man is too many. What do the people say, Norbu? Then, I am lucky. I am still too young. But, I have no experience. ""To the members of the United Nations: ""Tibetans have for long lived a cloistered life in their mountain fastness, remote and aloof..."" Tell me. You, kill me? Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me? I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now. We cannot. Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy.  We have compassion for all people. How could I ever leave? I accept it. We shall send delegations to America, India, Nepal and Great Britain, in hope that these countries will intervene on our behalf. We have telegraphed our appeal to the United Nations and await its reply. I am sending a delegation to China to negotiate the Chinese withdrawal. It seems that I must depart Lhasa. The majority wills it. Lukhangwa and Lobsang Tashi? I am making you my Prime Ministers. You will stay here. You must always keep me informed, no matter how bad the news. I want plain information. Today, I declare a general amnesty. You will not come? Am I running away? I will miss you. We have. And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder. A moment. Yes.  I am ready. Safe journey.  Safe return. All quiet? Where are you from? Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me. I worry about them. Eighteen, wonderful. Did you love your husband, before you married? Hmm. Does he treat you fairly? No. Much too young. Like my mother. This little brother was terribly sweet.  When he died, my mother was so sad.  A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin.  He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born. He does, a little spot where the butter had been. What do you think? You decide. Soft.  Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.  He has a very poor beard, with a little spot on his chin where no hair grows.  It feels like that. All? And the United Nations?  Surely? Where is that? So, we must face China and all her might alone. With much bloodshed. I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China? He is a capable man. And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking.  Agreed.  Send Ngabo. Time to study. Wait. We are in the last outposts of Tibet. Let's do away with some of this formality. ""I will liberate those not liberated."" I will release those not released. I will relieve those not relieved. May I deliver them to the state of enlightenment."" Yes, but they say he did. Yes. Then, we shall meet. General Chiang. Thank you.  Please sit. I have. Soon. Let me see the agreement. Counterfeit. I thought he would be some kind of monster, even with horns growing out of his head.  But, he is only a man, just an ordinary human being, like myself.  Life is always a lesson. If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose? At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war. Tibet, at war?  No. China is close, America is far away.  After countless people die, China would still, always, be close.  We will work with what we have. I am scared. My first and foremost duty is to protect my people.  I feel sure of this. Impermanence. Our own short lifetimes are not the only valid consideration.  No! No! No, Norbu! You see here thangkas of the Fifth Dalai Lama, the founder of our government.  It is tradition at formal meetings for these thangkas to be hung. Songs?  What songs? I have no authority to ban singing in my country. I am so sorry. I accept your resignations. There will be no new Prime Ministers. They have taken away our silence. I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation. I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao.  I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay. For me, I think such a mix is crucial. ""If moral discipline is learned from the beginning, one possesses the root for achieving higher rebirth.  A staircase for achieving liberation.  An antidote eliminating misery and sorrow.  Without discipline there is no method."" I am thinking of becoming a Communist Party Member. I like what I see of Marxism.  It is based on equality and justice for all. I believe Chairman Mao wishes the best for our people.  Our path must be non-violence.  Co-operation. I leave tomorrow. I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments.  Industrial progress.  Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous. He will betray us. I had relinquished doubt. Are you happy? I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns. A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese. I have always asked for plain information.  Just the truth. The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult. I will not approve it. You have bombed on peaceful people. No.  We are peace loving people. I am afraid we cannot trust you. I burn here, but I am not suppose to let the smoke show.  Yes, we need reform.  The monasteries. Communications.  Schools.  But we want change for Tibet, as Tibet needs it, not for China. Buddha is our physician, General, he will heal us.  Comapssion and enlightnement will set us free. You can not liberate me I can only liberate myself. The people will not allow it. ""I rejoice in the Awakening of the Buddhas, and also in the spiritual levels of their Sons."" ""And with gladness I rejoice in the ocean of virtue from developing an awakening mind that wishes all beings to be happy..."" ""As well as in the deeds that bring them benefit. AND OTHERS ""With folded hands I beseech the Buddhas of all directions. To shine the lamp of Dharma For all bewildered in the gloom of misery."" ""Thus by the virtue collected Through all that I have done, May the pain of every living creature be completely cleared away."" I will not go. Do you think I must? Tibet has never been part of China.  We are different races. We are different cultures. We need change, we know that. But we could do it alone. We were just about to do it alone. I am afraid I will go. Far, far away. Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders. I fear that there will be great bloodshed if you cannot convince the people to disperse and go home. I am safe. Tell them I will be here. With my people. Right here. Dim the lights. Wait. I see a safe journey. I see a safe return. Now.  I am ready. I have always loved mountains. ""Right will be victorious."" I repudiate the Seventeen Point Agreement I constitute the Government of Tibet, the only legal authority in the land. What you see before you is a man.  A simple monk. I think I am a reflection, like the moon, on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, see yourself"
sphere,NORMAN ,Dustin Hoffman," You seen my suitcase? He didn't say much at all.  Honey -- Don't be so supportive, honey. Four.  Four years -- Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news? What? I don't know. I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors. You've heard of me? What report? What report? Know what? Who's everyone? Geologists?  At a plane crash? What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash? Just that.  Careful, it's heavy. No, they didn't say -- Captain who? Really? What report? Told me what? Thank you, Colonel. Captain.  Right, forgive me. Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.  The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington. What team? The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really. Nothing else. Hello. Press?  No, I haven't. From what?  What's with all the security? Storm?  What storm? They didn't tell me anything. How deep is he? A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors. Then why am I here? What do you need me for? What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite? Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash? Four hundred?  You're kidding, right? Geologists? -- Wait a second -- Hold on -- -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old. It's impossible. It doesn't make any sense. What team? ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it? But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life. Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret? That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about? It's bullshit.  The report's a joke. I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea -- C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind. Wait -- down where? Underwater? We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks. It never occurred to me. The timing has never seemed quite right.  What -- are you threatening me? Seasick?  A marine biologist? Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't it? Arthur? Arthur?  You alright? He wasn't feeling well. What? Fine.  I'm fine. I'm not being defensive. I'm fine. What's wrong with oxygen? Me?  Well -- I don't really...  I mean, you could... you know, you could make a real solid case... a crowbar? I don't know. Are we all -- I mean, is it necessary for all of us to go... out there?  Yeah.  Drowning.  No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first. No, why don't -- Wait a second, I -- Geez, c'mon, alright.  Gimme a minute.  Let me get my bearings -- Look, would you -- You want me to try? Take a look. Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted. 400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations. Sounds a little like water -- Get this thing off me. Whatever I can do to help. 01-01-47.  Two thousand-forty seven. 50 years in our future. To what? Picked up something?  What is it? Which one?  Let me get the list out. But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past. Maybe we shouldn't. If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all. I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report? Or maybe, it can't be killed. I don't know.  That's the point. Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point. Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think. Don't be so optomistic, Harry. Not a clue. I don't follow you. So what? Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone. I can't believe that, Harry. I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong. Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight. No.  I didn't say that. It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you. I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us. All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him. Harry's missing. He's missing.  He's gone.  He left. You can't just leave Harry down here, sir. But sir -- What noise? Harry, can you tell me about the sphere? You remember opening the door? Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry? Then explain it to me. What is it, Harry? Page 87 of what, Harry? That far in what, Harry?  These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming. When did it come across? Where's it coming from? Is it coming from our own computer? Getting anywhere with those? Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria? You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die. You don't remember that? What happened to you inside that sphere, Harry? What is this, Beth?  You taking valium? Where'd this come from? We have a library? No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish. ... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him. Yeah, it was awful. Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish? What do you mean -- not normal? Wait a minute. You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there? And you didn't tell anyone? Beth -- They are or they aren't.  Which is it? Beth. Beth -- Beth. I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic. You don't want to know. A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement. She put a razor to her wrists a day later. '81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know. At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break. Wait a second -- -- I didn't know it would come to this -- Like what? You mean a picture? I don't see anything. Please, Ted. This is like nursery school. The creature? Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with? That's brilliant. The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you. Well, he's polite. That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence. I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response. When he uses a phrase like ""I am Happy"", I think we should think twice about what we ask him. Jerry, can you understand what we're saying? Jerry, can you read our minds? Jerry, are you there? We would like to talk alone. And we enjoy talking with you. We'd like to talk with you more.  We admire your talents and your great power and understanding. And in your great understanding, you know that we are entities who must talk in private -- with each other. We're not afraid, we are uncomfortable. Not at all, we enjoy you very much, but we need to talk alone, without you listening. Thank you. Jerry?... Jerry?  Are you still there? Jerry? Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect. Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional... ... it raises a very serious question: What happens if Jerry gets mad? I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge. What could have done this? What are they? What was it? Has Harry spoken with Jerry? Jerry? Jerry, are you there? I'm not sure. What for? At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring. C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back. So what? You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up -- Where did you get this? You went through Edmunds' things? Calm down, Beth.  Alright? It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay? What? Beth -- Don't do this. Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright? Beth -- But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related. Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further. Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier. Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it. Jerry, we don't want to ignore you. We don't. Jerry -- Jerry? Jerry? Jerry? Jerry?  Please.  Stop this. Yes, sir.  I'm here. High Voltage Defense System. I see it. It won't stop. Does this mean what I think it means? The ships? How are the others? Beth and Harry? That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier... About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- ... how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- Jerry? Jerry, did you create that man? Jerry, are you manifesting what's destroying our habitat? Jerry, answer me. Jerry? Where are you going in such a hurry? Forget the sub. It's not worth the risk. You, me and Harry? Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta -- Four days? Why should I go? In case you die, too? I would.  But my suit --  You fixed my suit? But I don't know how -- I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear? You fixed this suit?  Beth? My air isn't... I'm coming back. Still clear? I'm in.  Hello? Beth? Beth?  Hello? Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- ! Beth!  Shit! Beth?  Can you hear me? Beth?  Beth?  Shit. Harry? I can't breathe...  Am I... clear? Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- What do you mean?  She's not here? She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me. Beth left? What are you doing in the ship?  Beth? Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me. He what? You didn't say that about the food? But why would she -- ? I think so, Beth.  Yes. Fixing it. The refridgerator. It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any. We must've had it delivered then. 1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good. Did you look?  It was on the top shelf. You think? All I know is I opened that refridgerator -- This being after you so carefully fixed my suit. I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there. Page 87. Page 87.  ""I could never read that far."" ""Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids... ""... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."" After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, ""Stop calling me Jerry"".  And -- He translated it wrong. Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?...  My name is Harry. Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say ""Harry"", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry. When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere. He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things. I don't know. I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real. He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.  No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are. Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control. Looks like some sort of code. Wisconsin? How do we decode it? The cavalry is on it's way. We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this. That's right. Diphenyl parlene. Ephedrine hydrochloride. Valdomet. Sintag. Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under. Tarazine? Bingo. Riordan? Damn it!  Chloramphenicol? Parasolutrine? P-a-r-a-s-o... What's that? It's like a sleeping pill? Here we go.  ""20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "" Three to six hours. What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous? Doesn't say. What is that?  What are you doing? What do you want to do -- kill him? Beth -- You want to kill him? Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You? Where do I stick it? He's got Farrakahn's army standing guard.  What's plan B? You know what it is, Harry. It's the squid!  Stop it! You know damn well what.  You're doing it! I'm sorry. Not believing you. Beth? Beth? Can you copy? Beth? Where are you? The sphere looks different. The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now. He's fine. Beth -- Beth?  Beth?  Can you hear me?  Get the hell out of there. Beth?  Beth?  Shit. Beth?  I'm getting some sort of reading.  There's something -- And whatever it is, it's not coming from Harry. Beth?  What is that?  What are you doing? Can you hear me?  Beth?  Can you copy? Get inside, there's something out there. Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me. What the hell? Beth?  C'mon.  What are you -- ? Oh shit. It's her. Ouch.  Your watch. Your watch. I'm feeling better. You think I'd really drink that? You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink. How do you feel about snakes? You know what I mean. What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing. Do you fear them? Are you manifesting them? Did you? Why did you go in the sphere, Beth? Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat. He can't manifest. Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes? Someone did. Beth you're losing it.  C'mon. You're lying -- But --  That's when you went in the sphere. You manifested that, Beth. You're insane. I never went in that sphere. Yes. That's bullshit. Beth, the message said Harry.  ""My name is Harry"".  My name isn't Harry. Shut up, Beth -- It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be. Don't, Beth. I promise -- Beth -- Don't, Beth.  Please. Beth -- It's not safe for you to be either. Get away from the door, Beth. Don't fuck with me, Beth. Turn off the water, Beth. Beth! Where is it coming from, Beth? Beth, stop it! Then where's it coming from? Stop it! Beth?  Can you hear me?  Beth. Beth? I can't do that. I know.  You're too strong, Beth. I -- Beth -- gimme the gun. C'mon -- Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home. C'mon, Beth. What? Hear what? Beth -- I don't think so. Hey!  Look!  We didn't kill you, alright?  And believe me Harry, I would've found great pleasure in bashing your head in. Help me lift her. Shut up and open the door. Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub. A little less than six minutes. Shit.  Harry!  I'm gonna have to lift her up to you. Hold on. I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her. Are you trying, damn it?  Just -- Hold on. I heard!  I heard! Shut up and catch. Alright, here, I'll... wait, you -- just give her to me. Shit.  Alright, Harry, get in there. Take her, come on.  Just -- I'm trying to keep balance with -- Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here! You got her? Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry? No idea. Wait! Shut up.  Let me think. Nine hundred feet to surface. Maybe.  Brace yourself. Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means. You know, I think you really need to see a psychologist. There is one possibility. The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away? It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power. Yes.  And I think we already know it will. Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget. What report?"
psycho,SAM ,Viggo Mortensen," Never did eat your lunch, did you. Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.  We could laze around here a while longer. I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it... You sure talk like a girl who's been married. I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.  The only girlish thing you have lost. For what? Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters? And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!  You can't laugh at it, huh? Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but... And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal. I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal. (goes close to mary, touches her) Next best thing to no conscience at all. I can come down next week. Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public? And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?  All right. Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.  I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind. I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere. A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then... Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing. And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps. You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like. (he moves away, suddenly serious) Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.  How can you even think a thing like that! Hey, we can leave together can't we? Yes?  Sure... Lila. Is something wrong? Here? Where? What's the matter? What should I know? No. I take it you don't either? (As Lila shakes her head) How long? And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?  Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and... I was getting to that! Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive. Bob? Run out and get yourself some lunch. Run out and eat it. What thing? What thing could we be in together? Is Mary... in trouble? Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?  Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary. Who are you, friend? What's your interest? Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then... Why? What are you talking about?  What is this? She isn't! Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...  I don't believe it.  Do you? You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister. It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police? He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash... No. How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my... (Smiles at the incongruity of his reply, then goes serious) If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us... I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that! You've led a charmed life. Maybe we can handle it together. (He smiles encouragingly)  I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here. She'll need both of us.  First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on. (as he reaches for the closed-for-lunch sign) After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.  Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila? It's been three.  He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay? Hundreds! Which one is your pet? I feel better when you feel better. You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours. That wouldn't be a wise thing to do. Arbogast said...  Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.  Probably on his way back right now.  You'll never find it. Stay here.  I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.  Contemplate your... panic button. Arbogast? He didn't come back here? No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling. Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on... In a hurry.  Yes. I think he would have. Let's go see Al Chambers. He's the Deputy Sheriff around here. Our Deputy sleeps. Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep. No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on. Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you... We have a problem. I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.  This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary... Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway... He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates... No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and... They thought she'd be coming to me. Yes.  Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police. He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet. I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...  Was that all? You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother? I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman. Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me. We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.  You didn't find anything. No mother. Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type. Want me to drop you at the hotel? Or you want to come over to the store? Neither will I. Of course we will. Where'd you go to college?  She was willing to lick the stamps. We were going to get married. Are going to get married! This is the old highway. Watch your tenses. She always tries to be proper. I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in... You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!  I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting? Come on.  Just coming up to ring for you. We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it. Better sign in first, hasn't we?  Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt. Haven't any. First time I've seen it happen.  Check in any place in this country without bags, and you have to pay in advance. That receipt...?  Don't bother yourself... we'll find it. I'm glad we didn't. I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there? How could we prove... (An almost hopeless laugh) Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now... What makes you sound so certain? We'll start with Cabin One. If he sees us... we're just taking the air. Bates? Sorry. What? What is it?  Bates never denied Mary was here. Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it? You can't go up there. Bates. You won't be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held. And I don't like you going into that house alone, Lila. All right. I'll find Bates and keep him occupied. Wait a minute. If you get anything out of the mother...  Can you find your way back to town?  If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.  Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk. Fine.  I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I? I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you? (As Norman does not reply) It would drive me crazy.  Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you? I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place... And now that your mother's dead?  I didn't think so.  You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening? I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it? Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother! Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it... ...Forty thousand dollars! I bet your mother knows where the money is. And what you did to get it. And I think she'll tell us.  It's regular. Okay?  Want to? Why was he... dressed like that?"
scream,SIDNEY ,Neve Campbell," Billy? What the... What are you doing here?  My dad's in the other room. Can you knock? No you didn't. ..out at the airport... Got it. Have a good trip. What are you doing here? Now that it's out of your system. Oh it did? So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would  have little bump- bump. Time to go, stud bucket. You know what my dad will do to you? I appreciate the romantic gesture. Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship? Get outa here. What happened? No way. Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English. Do they know who did it? They think it's school-related? Sheriff Burke. Dewey. Good. We're fine. Thanks.  How do you gut someone? Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?  You sure I can stay over?  My dad won't be back til Sunday. Tell your mom I said thanks. Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police and reporters...it brings it all back. Thanks, Tatum.  It's past seven. I'm not worried. Whatever. Just hurry.  Tatum? Hi. Who is this? I have no idea. Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over. I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy. Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.  Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl-who can't act-who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous. That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy. So who are you? So where are you? Why would you call me from my front porch? Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff. So where are you? Can you see me right now? What am I doing? Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now. FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN! Oh Billy...Please...God... He's here. He's trying to kill me... ..yeah... It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up. Did you reach my Dad? At the airport. I don't know. I guess. It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE? How's the book? I'll look for it. Any word on my Dad? Just another sleepover at the Riley's. No, nothing's like it used to be. He was there, Tatum. My Dad? It's alright. I'll get it. Hello? NOOOOOO... LEAVEMEALONE! Who are you? I'd rather be around a lot of people, Mama Riley. It's never gonna stop. Is it? Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up. And my Dad? Any word on him? Just a sec...I need to talk to someone. I'm not here to fight. I want to talk to you. Off the record. No cameras. Please. You owe me. You owe my mother. And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories. Do you still think he's innocent? During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar. Have you talked to Cotton? Has his story changed? He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat. I saw him leaving wearing it. No, Cotton murdered my mother. No, it was Cotton. I'm sorry I mangled your face. But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now. He promised me he'd be back. This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here. I bet he's pissed. Why are they doing this? Jesus, SHIT! No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me. I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house. I'm so sorry...please understand. You know that's not true. No... No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.  Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.  Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere. I'm glad to know you're coping so well with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so perfect. Some of us are just trying to hold on. Pathetic. Is someone there?  He's here...I saw him...he's here... It was him, Tatum. I know it. Are you serious? I don't know...  Yeah, okay...whatever. So you think my mom was a slut too? If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court? Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers. And you believe it? If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there. You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me. God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. Oh, god... Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling. Is Billy going to be there tonight? Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax. But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic? What do you think about when you're having sex? Who? How does that get you in the mood with Stu? No way. What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing? TATUM! Deal. Yeah. THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies? Have they found my father? Should I be worried? Billy? Jesus, you scared me. If Tatum sees you--she'll draw blood. It's okay. We need to talk. So... No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress. But you're right--enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was. I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something... Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense. But this is life. This isn't a movie. I wanna let go. I do... Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie? Or even a good porno. You heard me.  Yeah...I think so.  ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" Who did you call? When you're arrested-you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call? No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him. Uh-huh. No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you. BILLYWATCHOUT!!!! DEWEY! NOOOOOOOO!!!!! Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA KILL ME! Stop. Right there. Don't come any closer. Stay away. Fuck you both. Please! God! Help me! NOOOOOOOOO!!!  GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE! Oh God. Billy! I thought you were... He's out there. NO! Don't believe him. Stu...please...help me... Daddy! Why are you doing this? Fuck you. You're crazy--both of you. You'll never get away with this. Why did you kill my mother?  I don't understand... What? Stop it! You sick fucks--you've seen one too many movies. I like that ending.  Are you alone in the house? Not so fast.  We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?  So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them? Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy. Not this time. This is for my Mom, asshole. And this Billy stud-bucket is for having an incredibly small weenie. Oh Daddy... Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie."
casino,ACE ,Robert De Niro," When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.  Otherwise, what's the point? And, for a while... I believed that's the kind of love I had. Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good, that whenever I bet, I could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers flew in every year on their own nickel, and left behind about a billion dollars. But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas... But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved. Who could resist? Anywhere else in the country, I was a bookie, a gambler, always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino. And that's like selling dreams for cash. I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work. For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit... ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert? It's all this money. This is the end result of all the bright lights and the comped trips, of all the champagne and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get your money. That's the truth about Las Vegas. We're the only winners. The players don't stand a chance. And their cash flows from the tables to our boxes ...through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino ...the place where they add up all the money ...the holy of holies ...the count room. Now this place was off limits. Even I couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it filled with cash. That's for sure. As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy. A powerful man. He even played golf with the President. But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... ...he did what he was told. You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me. But what happens when they do find out?  It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way. I'm serious. No interference.  Where the hell did you learn how to deal? (He reaches down, stacking and arranging the chips.)  Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it. I'll take Columbia for twenty. Well, that's why they paid so well. Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right? I'll come by. Seven o'clock. Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us. How did Nicky collect? Don't ask. Hi, Melissa. Heidi. Eight.  Excuse me.  Is this yours? Your pen? I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost. Well, I was just offering you the-  Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead. In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced- in local cowboys working. They were close to the, you know, good old boys.  Pay him six hundred a week, tell him to walk around and look smart. I mean, without us, these guys, they'd still be shovellin' mule shit. Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner station. If you need 'Mr Clean', page him, all right? Mr Rothstein.  Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' white man, or what? What's his story? We can't get rid of him? I wouldn't give the bum a mop job. These yokels ran the state. They passed the laws, they owned the courts. Hello, Senator. Good to see ya.  William would you... I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.  Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants. Why not make them happy? For politicians... ...like our state senator up there, everything was on the house. These guys won their comped life when they got elected. So, hey, why not take advantage of it? Still, the politicians come cheap. We could handle them. It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, who plays thirty thousand dollars a hand in baccarat. That's the one you really gotta watch. He plays fast and big and he has the cash and the credit to turn out your lights. About a year ago, he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands. Downstairs, he takes us for two million... and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels. Another billionaire cheapskate who loves his free rooms... ...free private jets, and two million of our money. Nice to see you again. But we got him back. I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz. Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan. We got him back ...with a whole floor of rooms for himself. I'm sorry you missed the plane. No, no, no. No gambling. No. He bet one thousand a hand instead of his usual thirty thousand a hand. But I knew, the trick with whales like Ichikawa was that they can't bet small for long. He didn't think of it as winning ten thousand, he thought of it as losing ninety thousand. So, he upped his bets... ...until he dropped his winnings back and gave up a million of his own cash. In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing... ...and keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose. In the end, we get it all. In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else. Since the players are looking to beat the casino... ...the dealers are watching the players. The box men are watching the dealers. The floor men are watching the box men. The pit bosses are watching the floor men. The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. I'm watching the casino manager. And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all. Plus... ...we had a dozen guys up there, most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house. What a move. I fell in love right there. But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money. Ginger's mission in life was money.  See you, Ginger. She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money. Who didn't want Ginger? She was one of the best-known, best-liked and most respected hustlers in town. Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake for two or three days before sending him home broke to the little woman and his bank examiners. Any change? That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash. Ginger had the hustler's code. She knew how to take care of people. And that's what Vegas was all about. It's Kickback City. She took care of the dealers... ...pit bosses, floor managers. But mostly... ...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything. Ginger took care of the parkers because they took care of the security guards, who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate. The valet parking job was such a money-maker that they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession. But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond. The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep. He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks. I mean, the guy was always broke, he always had a story. And somehow, she could never turn him down. The way Ginger saw it, I guess, was that Lester was just an unlucky guy. Somebody had to take care of him. But nobody had to take care of Nicky. I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him. Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport. I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp. They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened. And they were usually right. Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it. I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.  Hey. Welcome to Vegas. Somethin', huh?  Ginger. Honey, come here. This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine. After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it. No, of course not. Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit. Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle. But still, it was nice and quiet for a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town, like regular Ozzie and Harriets. And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known. Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message. Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning. Everybody else: watch out. Like these yokels here who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home, 'cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble. Even after we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' back with beards and wigs and fake noses. You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet. Like this guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at five hundred each with only one little problem. He's always guessed right. If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot. But in the end, they're all greedy. I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it. He just wasn't protecting his hand. He was lifting his hole card way to high. Now, here's this guy... ...reading the dealer's hole card... ...and signaling his buddy [the WINNER] at this table. And that's just what these hustlers look for. They cruise from casino to casino, lookin' for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope.  Operator? This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and Friday over at pit two right away.  BJ nineteen, second base, the beard [Blackjack table number 19, second position, man with the beard]  Operator... I need Mr Happy, loud. Watch it now. They never know what hit them. And if and when... ...they do find out they just got zapped by a cattle prod... ...they wish they really did have a heart attack. Turns out this guy and his fuckin' pals, they were knockin' this place dead for years. We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.  I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands? Can't do it with both hands? Can you do it with your left hand? So, you're a righty? Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.  All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want? And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand? You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it? Get out of here.  Throw him out in the alley.  And just tell the cops he got hit by a car. Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around? I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family. I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore. Yeah, I know all that.  I - I - I... No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine. Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance? When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' You all right? Why're you crying? Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right? You're with me now. Right? You sure? Want to go? Let's go back in. Try it on. It's yours. It's chinchilla. It's nice isn't it? You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises? The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank. Now look, (gently holding her face, gathering her total attention) pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important. All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. With over a million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas only for Ginger, she was secure and happy. She loved that shit. But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of pay-off cash around. Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks. So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money. And, since I'd either be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money the most... ...I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive. So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?  Yeah, sure I do. Why? Well... With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered, and to play it safe I switched job titles again and made myself, um, Food and Beverage Director. This way nobody would bother me about a license. I mean, Vegas was like a dream for me. Trouble was... ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas. It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy. Signaling back and forth. Nicky thought nobody was watching him. But he was wrong. And I didn't want any of those agents near my place. I mean, I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost. What am I gonna do? Go back home and start a war? I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.  Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place. You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.  I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint? Call security. How are you? Good. You want to do me a favor? You want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes back on?  I want you to exit this guy off the premises, and I want you to exit him off his feet and use his head to open the fuckin' door.  Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.  No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?  He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...  ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.  Then he called me a faggot.  So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.  If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.  Okay.  You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this? Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'. Why is she eight pounds over? I... 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough. She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen... ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer. That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris. No. Just stop everything. I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy. Between... ...my innovations... ...and Nicky's dedication to his job... ...I soon had the best operation on the Strip. You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already. I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book. Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you. I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you. Back home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. But out here, they're givin' me awards.  It's with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation from the... But my greatest pleasure was watchin' my wife, Ginger, work the room. They all loved her. How could you not live her? She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her. She made everybody feel good.  Oh, thanks. Thank you. Thanks for that compliment. He was a young kid from the casino... nice kid...  bright boy. What balls on this fuckin' kid! The next day I fired him. But as much as they loved her... ...they didn't know what really moved her. And with Ginger happy, I was able to concentrate on what I knew best. What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there. What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden. These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off. The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front. Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand? Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this. So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen- hour days?  Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas. Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.  Yeah, I believe it. You got banned. Nope, there's no way. Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is. In so many words, yes. It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. He had tipsters... ...all over town. Bellmen. Valet parkers. Pit bosses. Secretaries. And they all... ...got a piece of the score. They were always very careful. And they always bypassed the alarms, or else... if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer... Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him. For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fuckin' Wild West. Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them. In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower. It was a very popular spot. He had politicians, showgirls and movies stars hangin' out all over the place. But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky liked the most was the showgirls, naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star. But around six-thirty in the morning when he finished his day - - no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy. The word got around that finally... ...there was a real gangster in town. Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas. Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are? Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me? You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on? Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won! Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels. The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?  You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?  Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here. I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you - I'll regret it even more if I keep you on. Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go. I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History. So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it. Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here. Look at yours. Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing. It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.  From now on I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin. An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin. I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin. Come on, honey, just a little. That a girl, that a girl. Oh, boy, look.  Okay, want to go with Mommy? What do you need? Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there. Twenty-five thousand? For yourself? Why do you need that much? Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean... Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for. Why can't you tell me what it's for? Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat? Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that? What are you talkin' a- ? You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you? Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for. How you doin', Les? It's Lester, right? Sam. From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler... the pimp from Beverly Hills? If I'm wrong, please correct me, 'cause I never knew you to be a heist man.  But if you are, you know what... here, take mine too. Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already have hers. She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me. You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here. You fuckin' piece of shit. You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?  Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.' Come here, I want to show you somethin'.  Okay...  ...give me a minute.  Okay, send him in and call me four minutes after. How do you do? Yeah, I heard a lot about you. No, that's quite all right. Why don't you have a seat? I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here. Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest. I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him. I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.  I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.  Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry. No problem. (Getting up and shaking hands.) Sorry. What happened to my pills?  Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too? Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?  What? Yeah, how do I know? What? What?!  Listen. (Stepping up to the bed.) Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself. If not for me, at least for Amy.  You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones. Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.  Yes, I - yes, I do. How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. (Strokes her hair. Then, quietly:) You can do it.  You can do it. No matter how many novenas you could make, nothin'... ...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino. It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers... ...Green tried to stonewall her. So... ...she sued him in court. Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky... ...clean front man. So, I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew the casino was on the up and up. I serve at the pleasure of the chairman of the board and... my, uh, responsibilities are to run the day- to-day operations. Well, in a sense, you could say that... I am the boss, when Mr Green is away. You could say that.  Hello.  No, you, you can't. You gotta make a reservation.  It's all booked up.  It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...  ...very difficult to get in.  Uh...  ...all right.  Why don't you take it easy with that stuff? Huh?  Come on. Let me help you. Come on. We're talkin' about some stuff.  Just go downstairs.  Just... go downst- Hey. Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?  What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI. I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head? Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand? No, I don't wanna come - I don't wanna come along with you. I'll be honest with you. I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about... ...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it. That's all taken out of context. Okay. I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad. Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad. What happened to me? What happened to you? You lost your control. Yes, you lost your control. All right. All right. Yeah. My wife? Now, what does she have to do with all this? All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation? Listen, I would - I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you. Please... ...don't do it to me... Okay? Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that. That's right, yeah. Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy. This guy is gonna run to the FBI. I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it. Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody. Plus, he had stopped askin' permission from back home for every little thing. A casino boss and his wife were killed. The bulls questioned Nicky. A dealer from the Sirocco... they questioned Nicky. A bunch of stool pigeons wound in the trunks of their cars... they questioned Nicky. A lawyer... they questioned Nicky. And when some guys who didn't pay their Shylocks began disappearing, Nicky's name was in every one of those newspapers. Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses. The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't car"

godzilla,NICK ,Matthew Broderick,"  ...I'm singing in the rain, just singing in the rain... ...""What a glorious feeling. I'm happy again..."" ...""I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up above..."" ...""The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love..."" ...""Let the cloudy skies chase..."" ...""I'm singin' in the mud, just scooping up my worms...""  Good day. I am here with permission...I have a, a...  Permit. How do you say permit? It's Tatopoulos. What are they doing? You can't shut me down now! My research here's not finished!  It's Tatopoulos. Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here? You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions. Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field. Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm? The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means? It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent? They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them. What sample? I don't see it.  Where is it? I don't see it!  That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint. But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there? Somebody must have seen it. Hi. Nick Tatopoulos... Oh, I'm not married. No. Perhaps I work too much. Not for a long time, now.  Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this? Mind if I borrow this? Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost... Thanks. What about the traces of radiation? The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur. What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years. More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region. Yes! We're looking at a completely incipient creature. The dawn of a new species. The first of its kind. I don't think so. I don't understand. How can something that large just disappear? I don't think so. I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An island, water on all sides. But like no other island in the world, this is a place where he can easily hide.  He's in there someplace. You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal. When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out. All we need to do is find out what it wants, what it needs, and he'll come to us. I'm kind of hoping the same thing. That's a lot of fish. I need your radio. Sergeant O'Neal, the subway vents. We have to shut them down...  ...With the air pressure pushing up, he'll never smell the bait! We need to open all the manhole covers in the area. Let the scent waft down. That's not true. We fed him.  It's okay, I'll get out here. Do you have any home pregnancy tests? Especially ones that test for catastrophic hormones or clomiphene citrate. I'll take them all. Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been? So you made it. You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am. No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real ""boring"" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises... You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad. Most people don't. Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea? When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism. I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature. Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening... I got pretty close. Well, we know he eats fish, he's of reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's amphibious and... ...he's pregnant.  Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy. The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting! Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time! Forgive me but I've got to get this into the lab, to confirm all this. I'll be right back. Audrey? Audrey? Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled. Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has. I don't believe so. No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population. It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly. The fish. The fish we found down in the subway. He's not gathering all that food for himself. He's preparing to feed his young. No, I didn't...I didn't talk with anyone. Yes...but I... No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it. Me too. Make sure they find that nest before it's too late. Newark airport. Well what the hell did you think was going to happen? I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you. So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes? Good luck in your new career. I think you really have what it takes. Do I know you?  Oh yeah, the insurance guy. Sounds like a big company. Oh.  Are you sure? How do you know? Why are you telling this to me? Why do you need that? Oh, my bags. I've checked them in. How did you get all of this stuff into the country? So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military? You said you wanted my trust, then I need yours. Sure. Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific. Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it. Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion. What's with the chewing gum? Just let me do all the talking. Oh, we're with the three two. Sergeant O'Neal just called down for us to join in. They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner. I guess we go this way. Three eggs. I thought there would be more. That can't be. That's got to be over twenty eggs. Good idea. How do I do that? I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong. Come on, come on. This is not good. I hate these things! Hey, it's me! They're loose. They're allover the main lobby. I couldn't get out. It's okay. I know her. What are you doing here? I was wrong. Circuits are overloaded. How do you know? Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.  Yes, they did. We've discovered over two hundred eggs which began hatching only moments ago. If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.  If those creatures escape and multiply, in a very short time a new species will emerge. One that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet. Thanks, Audrey. Are you okay? You'd be surprised. Ohhhhhhhh.....shit. Sorry, guys, I've promised my story as an exclusive to another reporter. Where's Raymond? Hello? Where are you? I understand. Wait. (line goes dead; to himself) Au revoir. Oh, just some insurance guy."
monkeybone,STU ,Brendan Fraser," I don't actually draw all the animation, no. We have sweatshop workers who couldn't get jobs at Nike doing that. Guide...? I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor.

There's animals. They - Chasing me - animals - horrible - Uhh - martini? Olive. - Where exactly am I? Stu Miley. Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable. I didn't say anything. I was, uh, just getting ready to leave... Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then. I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's nightmares. And of course, I need not add - You have humiliated me in public for the last Then you can learn to act normally. I had to! I am not. And I don't gotta. Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my species. Nothing for him! He's being repressed. I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name? Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again. I shoulda proposed, Kitty. That way at least she'd know how I feel. That way she'd...wait for me.nan I'm not so special. I'm just - kind of - THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK! What union? Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey. No. No. Not him. He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come he goes back and I stay here?  HEY!! HEY, YOU!! He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get I've been stuck down here for months. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna kick ass! That's right. Run! And don't come back unless you've got my e-ticket!! Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna get out of here. I'll never see her again. Hypnos! The god of nightmares! Do you know what this means, Monkeybone? He's finally going to hear my case. I'm going home! Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...doodle. Say, have you seen Mr. Hypnos? Wow. Live feed, huh? Sorry. That - that's me. What is this? Who's dreaming this??  Julie?? JULIE!! JULIE!

Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you - Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me die. Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of here... ...which is actually what I wanted to talk to you about. See, I've been here three months - Tell me what? Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm - I'M GOING HOME! I'M WAKING UP! HEY, EVERYBODY! I'M OUTTA HERE. I... I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some... Well - yeah - but that doesn't...apply. It was different then. I was depressed. My life is great now. I'm in love! Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never... Nine AM! But that's - twelve hours. Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do. Maybe you could talk to Death! You're Death's brother? Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to... Hyp, I'll do anything. Land of Death. How do I get there? Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.  I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you. No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing. All right. You can come. Now we just gotta figure out how to get there. He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride!  Stop shaking! I'll protect you. Where'd he go?? IT'S NOT WORKING. What? You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you. It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone? You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me. Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y-- Stop! Monkeybone! Please!! NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY - NO! JULIE! NO-O-O-O! EEEEEEPP!! Oooie! That smarts!!! Julie?... Hey, you are a looker. Who are y-- WHAT DO YOU WANT?? Alfred Hitchcock?? What is this stuff? Stephen King? What are you doing in here? Atilla the - ! What in hell is this place? YOU SET ME UP!! Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!? But why me? Why'd you pick on me?? Monkeybone...!? You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons?? How was it? I don't recall. I'm not like the rest of you. I'm just a regular guy! I'm not a ""nightmare maker."" But how? Did you all have sidekicks? Figments? ...Monkeys?? ...Kitty?!? Kitty...my situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey. Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her what Monkeybone is up to?? I took the liberty of calling a little press conference. We're on TV, so don't say ""shit.""  Shit! I said it. Shit! I said it again! So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em. You can't do this! You'll get in trouble! How am I gonna get past the guards? Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th-- I'll really...never...forget you. You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos. I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare you right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again. I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her. Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour. Coming from you, that's quite a compliment. Bend over? DEATH!! Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay.  I guess I'm yours now. Hey. Where's Monkeybone? Back? You're sending me back? Death! Thank you! Baby...you're asking the wrong guy. My tail itches."
mumford,MUMFORD ,Loren Dean," Don't tell me!  -- That's all the time we have. Sorry...  ...next time. I don't want to hear any more today. Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you? Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come. Good, then go. My patient had to leave early. Does the phrase ""nosy"" have any meaning to you, Lily? It was Henry Follett. What do you want to know? Fine, Vincent... how's yourself? Oh, I don't know... Lily, I don't think even you could know that -- Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.  You like me. How come? What do you mean, ""in no time""? Weekly or monthly? Why do you think you tell me, Nessa? It's a big part of the show. It's called pro bono. It's my bit for the community. Where was this? You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa? That's not quite what I said -- How are you? No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from? Nah... scotch. You want me... to be... your friend. But that's not what's really going on...  ...What's really going on is... you have some problems and you want some therapy, but you feel it could be very bad for Panda Modem stock if word got out that you were having head problems. Can I ask you a personal question? Have you thought about getting a wife? Is that the question? I understand. Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got. I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes. Lionel, since this is our first session together, maybe -- -- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like -- (Lionel waves that off and looks away) -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here. -- Go on! Sure I can, Lionel. See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here. Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea? And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope. Jeez... what an asshole. Me more than most. I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you. How did they threaten you? Good kids. Hmm? Really? You think so? How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.  Mr. Cook. Uh-huh. What's that? Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it. Why's that? Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon. Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change. Hello, Lionel. You're right, as usual. See you. Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with. Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you? So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely? Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.  Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?  She's probably ten years older than you. Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge. Well, there's Lily. Amazing. What kind of person do you have to be to do this? This -- Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies. Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character. Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her. Of course, it's not that simple. There's something powerful going on there. We've got a lot of work to do.  It's hit to the warning track! In these fantasies, Henry Follett is played by a handsome guy with biceps. Can you imagine that? Where your self-esteem has to be?  Man, I'd just like to move the guy to the point where he gets to appear in his own fantasies. Feel free to lie down. Most people do. What can you tell me about this? When did you start to feel this way? What?  No. Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind? Hmm. Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out. I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that. We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot. I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking. We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it. We'll work it out. No one ever thought so. You must bring it out. Maybe you'll catch it. You must be Katie. People call me Doc. Doc. Nice to meet you. Nope. I've had my moments. I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, ""I should have spent more time at the office."" What do you do?  We've been talking about her, mostly. You've done well. A little. Tastes good. What do you think's wrong with her? She seems very unhappy. Sure. Don't need it. You're good. That would explain it. I'm trying. Is she a friend of yours? It's a pretty piece of land. Horror show. What'd you do tonight? ...And? Why do you watch? We'll turn back anytime you want.  Yes. It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Cook. Ph.D., psychologist. That's right, the fake kind. People usually have to get to know me before they hate me. Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging. Is she against you getting help? Something's bothering her. Please... forgive me. Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right? Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.  I've offended you! Really? What would it take? Sorry... I'm done. I want you to tell me all your symptoms. Be specific. Sore throat? Low grade fever? Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression? Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here. Life. Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe? So the headaches may not even be a part of this? I can give myself a headache instantly. All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.' There... I've given myself a real whopper. Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric. Mr. Follett. Henry! Stop now. Not for this. Not me, you're not. It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters. You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination. You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip. Where's your wife, Henry? Where's your wife, Henry?  I didn't hear you.  What?!  Now we're back on track. What's that? Hey, Skip. That's all right. What's on your mind? Yep. Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves. It's just a thought. You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret. That is correct, Skip. I'm going to have to take a long look at that. -- Skip. Knowing what you do about me -- You are Panda, monarch of modems. Okay... let's say that, for now.  Jerking off? Slash what? A doll? How's it coming?  And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret? Sounds like kind of a good idea. Definitely. Skip, that's not much of a secret. Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two. You want to know a secret? I'll tell you a secret. Since it's just between us and all... The secret, Skip, is this -- I am not now, nor have I ever been... a psychologist. We'd better get going. Just follow my light. And, Skip, watch your step. Just you. Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc. I can tell you anything else. Did you know that every species of mammal has found some way to drug, inebriate, or anestnetize itself? Even if it's just banging its head against a rock. Seems to be some natural urge... to get away for a while. (one more look at Skip) I've had it for as long as I can remember. The first place I wanted out of was home... I thought I had the best parents in Bald Knob, West Virginia... till I was seven years old and got a look at some others. They weren't bad folks... ...but they were real unhappy about being who they were... It made no sense that school came easy for me... I didn't do much work, and there was a proud tradition in my family of being really dumb. My friends didn't like it much. It made them distrust me... On the other hand, it made some of my classmates like me better... I don't know what it was in me, maybe some genes from my mom, maybe some discomfort with myself, but early on I was drawn to any substance that made me numb... When I got a scholarship to go out of state to college, I was the first one in my extended family who'd gone beyond high school. At graduation, my folks looked like a normal, happy couple, which I guess they were about 10% of the time... out in public. My roommate was from a planet I had never heard of called Scarsdale, where everything was the opposite of West Virginia... All the other kids, in fact, seemed to know things I didn't. They were friendly enough, but in four years, I never got over feeling that I had sneaked in... and was about to be exposed as the hillbilly and imposter I actually was. The thing that always made those feelings go away was... fun. Fun was drugs, fun was sex, fun was aggressively doing nothing. The only problem I had with degenerate, self- destructive behavior was... I couldn't get enough of it. All that fun eventually had an impact on the work I was doing. I figured, what the hell, it was only college, after all. I'd straighten up when I went out in the real world... I didn't want to jump into my career right out of college. And since I had no career, that turned out to be not much of a problem... I had a series of challenging jobs over the next few years... ...pizza delivery, pipe fitting, pest control... lots of jobs that started with the letter ""p"". For some reason, I kept losing these jobs.  The only mind-altering substance I never had a problem with was alcohol. I never got drunk. I didn't like the feeling. But really, when you're as fucked up as I was... big deal. Eventually, doing all these different jobs, I noticed something. For some reason, probably because I was too stoned to talk, everywhere I went -- -- people would talk to me, tell me everything... their stories, their problems, their innermost thoughts. Sometimes they'd pretend they needed advice, but mostly people just wanted someone to listen. Anyway, one day I was spraying for termites when I had a vision -- -- it was time to put my college degree to work and get a job with a desk. I took the civil service exam and found myself working at the Internal Revenue Service, District 14, Central Administrative Office. I started off as a general records clerk... I guess the standards weren't too high there, because my superiors got excited and pushed me to take the advancement tests... One guy in particular thought I should be a Revenue Officer. There was more money to be made as your classification went up. Which had a lot of appeal to me... ...since, even though I was certain I could stop anytime I wanted, I had developed a real affection for cocaine. It was my favorite hobby I had ever had. But I sure didn't want to be a Revenue Officer, where you were face to face abusing -- and getting abused -- all day long... ...And being a Collection Agent was definitely not in my genetic make- up... But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator. Everybody has a story, Skip. What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs. It wasn't the best situation. Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS. I got teamed with one of the top guys, a fanatic named Gregory. He always got his man, whether they deserved it or not. He was a ""closer"" and everybody admired that... He'd make the case and the Collection guys would come in and clean up. Our specialty was... sleazy skulking... We were a good team. I was a dope addict and Gregory was insane. Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.  ""Get to know your therapist.""  But look at me now... Things got a lot worse. The way the District Managers got ahead and won their bonuses was by generating maximum payments. That meant the revenue officers had to use all their ""collection tools"" -- seizures, liens, levies -- even if a more reasonable compromise could have been worked out. The best way to reduce resistance from the taxpayers was to build a convincing case -- whether there'd actually been a violation or not... That's where we came in. Our DM was a particular sonuvabitch, and he knew just how to get Gregory crazy. So several things were working on Gregory when we started building a case against a furniture maker named Edmond Worrell... ...and his family. Gregory was acting more and more irrational. We started doing things that were over the line even for the IRS. When I look back on it now, I'm sure Gregory must have known about Candy and me. On our team, I had become... ...the responsible one. Sometimes when a case didn't work out right, Gregory and this Revenue Officer named McLure would put the squeeze on the subject's accountant... There aren't many accountants who don't have something to worry about with the Service... The parties met repeatedly over a period of months. The IRS offered to settle for a sizable but, they said, fair amount. Worrell said he'd done nothing wrong and threatened to fight it all the way to Washington. He seemed pretty strong. I was secretly pulling for him. McLure and the District Manager stepped up the pressure. What none of us down at the Service knew was that Edmond Worrell had a story too... Worrell's was that he'd been fighting chronic depression for thirty years. Under the heat of the investigation, he fell off his medication. One Tuesday morning, he went down to the factory early, wrote his family a letter, then used the 9mm automatic they kept there to kill himself... The DM dropped the case that day and started proceedings to get rid of Gregory... Gregory went home drunk, beat up Candy and went out to drink some more. Candy told me she didn't want to see me again. She hated us both and she was leaving us both... It made perfect sense to me. I felt the same way... ...In fact, I was jealous of Candy. I wanted to leave too, just like her... get as far away from -- -- me... as possible. Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert... The joint wasn't fancy -- it was run by an order of monks -- but it worked. When I got out of there, I was just about broke... ...which seemed perfect for starting something new. Be back. That'd be Lily. Who'd you go with?  That's not good. You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product. All new people start with that... With desktop publishing, you don't have to deal with printers, supply houses, or pesky government agencies. Eventually you do have to get your hands on a typewriter. Ever seen one of those, Skip? What about it? Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See... ...Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's kindergarten class with me. He was killed with his parents in a wreck on their way back from a Steelers game. He was only six years old, which is a real plus, so there's a birth certificate if anyone checks -- but not much else. They died in Pennsylvania, so there's no death certificate in West Virginia... that's also good. Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased. Of course, my IRS training made it easier. Once you've done that, there's not much data you can't access and use any way you want. In a free society, you are who you say you are.  People should remember that before they go around knocking this country.  Skip, all this beer's got me sleepy. No... no training. English Lit. I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen. See you Thursday... regular time. You're doing great. It doesn't matter. Go on. Yes. Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter. Disgusting. It's pretty obvious to a trained professional. Is that when you split up? Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door. In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why? You like it? Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning. Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone. What is it, Nessa? What do you want me to see? If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay. What happened today? Was it something that happened at school? True. Should we stop them? Uh-huh. Do you think that's what he wants? What's the deal? Where am I supposed to eat? Hey, Skip! Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily. ...so rich? Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.  Of course... I've heard great things about you. Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that. Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me? Right now? Are we? My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo. It's possible. I don't know about that. Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place. Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak. Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks. Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.  I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport. My approach? I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little. I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about. Uh-huh. What are they? One hundred books? What happened? You must have been concerned. Doubtful. What did he say? Take your time. You can go out there if you like... Henry... I'm honored. You're completely reliable. Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.  Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden. There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday. Really? What'd I do? Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily. Wow. Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients? Yes, yes it does... What? No, Skip, it's not you. But I like you a lot. Yep. Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around? No. It's sort of spur of the moment. Well, actually, I can't really... Do you think I could see Sofie? A friend? There's something I think we need to talk about. Well... yes, I guess I should tell you. I don't think I'm going to be able to treat Sofie anymore. What do you mean? No, I really don't. Why don't you tell me?  I'd better go. Well... you see, the problem is -- Wow. You're something. Problem? I guess there is no problem... Uh, this friend of Sofie's, where'd he take her?  Oh, Roxy! Excellent. Roxy. It's a thought I had. Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help. You remember when I asked you about pornography -- -- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way -- But you did come to me. My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment. You know what? I think this was a dumb idea... ...I just heard myself talking and I realize I'm completely unqualified to be doing this. Let's forget the whole thing.  There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have -- My pleasure. That's what I like. Either one. I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't. That's one way to put it. I thought only action movies had villains like that. Yeah? That's... good? I don't know if -- Of course. Sofie... that makes me very happy. What'd he say? What did he want you to do? No again? Really? He agreed? Martin. How are you? I didn't see you there. Can I help you?  Do you want to come in? Mr. Gilroy -- What brought this on? How do you mean? What kind of doubts? I see. What's that? Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that. I'm very happy for you, Henry. I feel like we're making real progress here. Of course. Is something wrong, Sofie? You're upset. Is it something you've heard about me? Why don't you tell me what's on your mind? Um-huh. I'm glad. I don't follow you.  Okay... I think so. What was that? Transference. Hello. Yes. Hey, Ainge.  Lily. He told you.  You would have met in some shower eventually... Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.  Okay. That's it? That's what you're giving me? What it might take is... doing time. I'll tell her tonight. Good evening, Mrs. Cook. Could I see Sofie, please? What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook? Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that. I guess you saw the show...? Sofie... You probably got the idea. You're not the only one... Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.  But... I know it! Please believe me, I know that... But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off. Will you think about it? I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life. I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way. Anything... just ask. I do. Yes, your honor. Yes. I'm sorry, your honor. I'm sorry you're frustrated. No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry. Thanks for your help, Lionel. Will you wait for me? Will you be here? I'm fine. No, not really. Not any more. Go ahead."
hackers,DADE ,Jonny Lee Miller," Yeah, mom?  I'm taking over a TV network. Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers? Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari... Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem? It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there... Yak yak yak. Get a job! Yesssss! Hey! What? No, wait. Unbelievable. A hacker!

Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV! I'm Crash Override. It's cool, I'm just looking. Yeah? It has a killer refresh rate. Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that. Yeah. RISC is good. You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste? Yeah. Name your stakes.  Your slave? And if I win? Make it our first date. And you have to smile.  Talking to me? Dead. Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus. Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date. Deal. Thanks. Do my ears deceive me? I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't. Okay. I'll copy it. I told you, I don't play well with others. That's bullshit. You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you. I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone. Kate, listen. I have to tell you something. This isn't a virus. It's a worm! It nibbles. You see this? This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas. And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around. Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started. And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about... I know, I know who wrote it. This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me. I didn't know what was on it. I got a record. I was Zero Cool. I'll make it up to you! I'll hack the Gibson. Fucked if I care, man. Okay. Let's go shopping. You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of honor, I might take advantage of this situation.  Erotically, as it were. Shit!! Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson. What? Razor and Blade! They're flakes! I don't like this. AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this! Ummm... we come in peace? It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.  Let's go, Kate. Yeah. Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time. Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole. I found it! I found it! Oh, shit! He got me. Joey. I need you to drop your viruses, go after the worm. You're the closest. It's root slash period workspace slash period garbage period. We did it! They're TRASHING our rights, man! They're TRASHING the flow of data! They're TRASHING! TRASHING! TRASHING! HACK THE PLANET! HACK THE PLANET! Me, alright? I did it. She knows shit about computers. She... she's just my girlfriend. I'm trying to help you. What? Yeah. You look good in a dress. Wanna go for a swim? They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite. Beat that! You know, I've been having these really weird.."
antz,BALA ,Sharon Stone," General Formica! Well -- I thought -- since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another. It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation? General -- we have to talk sometime! So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?  Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...  You did?  Yes...he's wonderful... Wrong?  How could anything be wrong? I'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom.  Do I look fat to you? The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try someplace different. The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go! I'm the Princess, aren't I? And do Princesses do improper things? Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises. I'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day! I'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker-types to dance with me!  I know. Wanna dance?  I work in the palace, I don't get out much.  What? Are you sure this is a real dance?  Really? You're right! Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo! You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up! Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself? Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run! Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!  Who is that idiot? You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you? I'm Princess Bala. Yes.  No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero. You dance... No weirdly...You remind me of someone... He was swarthy...primitive... earthy...sensual. He was a worker.  I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?  OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER! I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!  Quiet -- sshhh!! SSHH!!!  SSHH!!! I'm coming!  I'm coming! I'm going!  I'm going' What was that thing? I order you to find out where we are! Climb up that tree and get a better view! I've been kidnapped by the village idiot. How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess! Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself! No!  There's no such thing as ""just two ants.""  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants! I -- hate -- you. Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!  I was slumming it!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place! I didn't choose him.  What kind  of idiot would...  ...choose who she wanted to marry? Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole! Insectopia?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale! Worker!  Come back here now! That's not a name!  That's just a letter!  Worker? (no response...louder now) Oh WORKER?  Where are you?  Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!! Water...water...  My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life. Look out! We're going to die! Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me?  Wait, I hear something! WATER!!! Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.  Out here I'm just what?  Stop fooling around in there. Let me go!!!  I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm going to be rescued soon. General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee. Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now. Well...no, but --  Well...I am the oldest. By three seconds...  You're right.  There are as many Princesses...as there are blades of grass.  I swear, we've passed this blade of grass three times. Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...  What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...  You were right...you were right!  Z, it's beautiful! Hello?  I'm not just ""any insect"". My mother is the Queen.  I'm Princess Bala! What do you mean? Oh...my...God. MMMffllmmm... Z!  Help me!!! Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere! Z!!!!!!!  I'm stuck! Z!  You're here!  Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know.... This is all your fault!!! Come on, Z. Did you say...  Z, we made it! Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess. You held onto this all that time? Stop!  You don't understand! He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis. Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.  Because...because he's twice the ant that you are.  I could never go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose. Z!  You came back! There's something going on, Z -- They're having a ceremony to open the Megatunnel... Oh no... Z!  what are you doing?  Z!!! Wait for me! Mom! Z...what can we do? No, I'm Z. A few?"
basquiat,BASQUIAT ,Jeffrey Wright," Ummm. It'll be great. We'll live together in peace. What's her name? Pancakes. Willie Mays.  Who's that? Who am I? Oh yeah.. Hey. What do you think?  Gina? How about those pancakes? I guess you did. Can I walk you home? Wait, I'm in a band....We're at the Mudd Club on Halloween. I'll put you on the list. I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do! Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday. Party girls? Can I call you? Here, this is for you. I made this. Hey, mom. I met the girl I'm gonna marry.

I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline? Jean Michel. Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.  Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros! No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me. No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get. You don't even know me. I want real respect.  Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it. Boom, for real. I thought you hated this place? Let's get out of here. Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep! Wanna go get some breakfast? A what? Yeah. 'Phillips head,' right? You don't have any!!! I didn't know.  My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me? I'm a painter, too. I am... On Gina.  Fuck - I didn't think we were actually gonna do this. About what? Oh - you mean black people!  How long do you think it takes to get really famous? Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else. Come on. I hate this. I'm no good at it. Who's John Henry? So then what? Like I said - my liquid hijack Marlboros.  Check it out. Andy Warhol. He's famous and he's not boring. He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these. You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks. Yeah... Like - stupid, ridiculous, crummy art. Ten bucks apiece. You don't even work on your stuff! I can get ten. You made a good deal. Here, you can have these, too. I'll be right back.  Check you later, man. C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now. ... I'll buy you some new ones.

Although I'll    never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your    hair, your hair, your face, your face' 'Even though you were never mine And you never will be You have a piece of my heart You have, you have, you have...' (he reaches down, wiping off Gina's face) 'Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face.'  Come on in! Gina, don't you want any of this? You could use some. ... What's the matter? You're back. It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone. I'm your family. Nothing special - just some weed. You want some? For real? Yeah... I'll paint on it. I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here for awhile. Can you put me in the ring with him? Jean Michel Basquiat. I was a kid then. You look fucking beautiful, beautiful. No. I don't know. You name it, I paint there. You want a drink? I had lunch with him once. Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?  Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee - Do you wanna marry me? Think so? ... babies. What's wrong with me? When? Honk the horn again, will you please?  You're late. I ain't John Henry. What's your fuckin' problem, anyway? Good. What do you have?  'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?' Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!  Fuck...  I forgot about that. Tony Bennett... What do you mean? I didn't know Tony Bennett painted. Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement? So what?  What time is it? That one's for you. I can't. After the show. Hey - it's the big A.M.. I don't know. Not sure. How was yours? I know. Yeah. You like it? Y'want me to make it a nice shit brown? Hi. This is Gina. Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids!  These paintings aren't even done yet!!! I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies. Yeah... And make it three apple pies.  I'd like to squeeze your titties. Wanna Mac? Have a Mac. Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name? No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink. Hi. A present I picked up for you.  You look like an angel. Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket. Yeah, I met her already. Hi Dad. Hi Nora. Thanks for coming.  I'll be right back. Which painting? Oh yeah. Not now, ok? That's alright. I'm cool now. I gotta go. He said 'of the painters!' Hey - Albert! Get in the picture! Well.  My dad's here with his wife. My mom couldn't make it. I wasn't gonna sell this one. Sure, ok.. Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour. I'll make you another one. Rene - Me? Why? That's great. Sure. I'd be glad to.  What's your name, man? Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job? Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him. Sure. I hate this. Turn that off. Decipher? They're just words. Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.  Leeches. A long list of leeches. (looking at some frames Shenge's working on) It looks good like that. You mean like an ape?  A primate? Oh, that's a ""Leonardo's Greatest Hits"" painting. You like it? I use a lot of colors - not only black. I'm not black. Not what? No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican.  Yup. We don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets..  Who said that? No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy. Are those the only two possibilities? (cramming a French Fry into his mouth) You wanna French fry? Should there be? Mmmm. I don't know. I don't remember.  Can I have some caviar, please? I'd like to taste it, first. Is that the best quality you have? I'll take the whole tin. I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar - I'll get the rest. You check everyone's bills or just mine? I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me. Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: ""Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"" Yeah - I'd do that... You could teach me. Cool. Let's leave this town and go someplace. Ouch.. That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina. Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her. Hey George, what's up? He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him? Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me. Chateau Latour '64, please. How is he? Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're - George? See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill. Yeah, just put their bill on my tab. Yeah.  Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were - I wish you niggahs could get it togeth- ahhhhhh. The tip. What's his name? I have to go to the bathroom.  What do you think? It's always how you would do it. This is my version. Why, so you could humiliate me? What's with the wigs? You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig? Piss painting? How come you're not peeing on them yourself? If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just ask. You could finger paint. We can do better. It needed more white. I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says ""Warhol? People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work. When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now. That's better. After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what Name? Number? Name? Number? Yo, Frank. I don't think so. Boom. That ain't ignorant - that's just stupid.  Can I get you a bowl of gumbo? Hey, Rene. Here... Pull over. What's up?  That's mine. There you go. Now it's worth more. I'm SAMO... I'm SAMO... Paint it out. Yeah... Maybe just his arms. Still not here.  Yeah.. Use your fucking instinct. Don't try to make art. Just paint like a housepainter. Why don't you try letting her in, Steve - I mean Shenge. Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you. Fine. It's unfinished.  How 'bout some blue in the corner? What's wrong with you today? Don't look at me like that. It hurts my feelings. Well, that's better.  You can buy direct from me. I need a dealer. Naa.. See ya in an hour.  So what do you think? I'm here. Do you ever get sick of it? The whole thing - painting. What about the shit they write? I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out. Hi. Stand still. See you later. B.B. It's me - Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year? What do you mean? Hello? Gina? Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second. Open the door. Open up! Open up! My mother's inside. I'm not here to visit... I wanna take her home. Willie Mays... Nice to see you. How's Gina? You guys getting along? I guess it was a long time ago. Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health! Just ring it up. I don't need a bag.  Try this tabouli - it's great... My mom told me this... Or was it a dream? There was this little prince with a magic crown. An evil warlock kidnapped him, locked him in a cell in a huge tower and took away his voice. There was a window made of bars. The prince would smash his head against the bars hoping that someone would hear the sound and find him. The crown made the most beautiful sound that anyone ever heard. You could hear the ringing for miles. It was so beautiful, that people wanted to grab the air. They never found the prince. He never got out of the room. But the sound he made filled everything up with beauty. It's definitely time to get out of here. Hawaii? Fuck Hawaii. Let's go to Ireland. We'll stop in every bar and have a drink."
leviathan,BECK ,Peter Weller," Give me a readout, DeJesus. DeJesus!  A readout!  Stay calm!  The internal monitors read normal. He's not at his station.  Get him into the Shack. Knock it off, Sixpack!  I know it's been a long month for every- one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart... Shit... Doc eat already?  How do you feel, DeJesus? Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner. Cut it, Sixpack. Leave the Doc to me.  I'm going to talk to him. I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...  ...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to--- I know all about the contract. The point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow...or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day.  It's up to you. You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help. Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters... Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the ""sick rack"" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?  What? There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit... Are you planning on working tomorrow?  We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit... I...I think it's important to have the second officer on deck. Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.  Thank you, Martin. This is Beck.  Is there a problem, Williams? That's enough!  How do you know it was Williams? All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--  At ease!  You both have a half day...Anymore shit and its a full one. Charge set? I need more light on that, Four. What's going on, Four?  What's happening? That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest. What's wrong?!  What happened? Willie?  What's going on? Why can't we pick up his signal? Affirmative...Widening picture.  Tighten the picture on the upper righthand corner. What's your air reading? Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?  Willie, we're giving you five minutes...after that we're coming in. Three minutes... One minute. I want all this stuff impounded in the supply safe. ...except this...it goes in my safe.  Be my guest. What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious? What mistakes? (he shakes his head wearily) Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check. This is a mining shack, not a lab, Doc.  If there's something strange with the vodka it's safe till we get back. Something wrong, Cobb? What's wrong with it?  All right... ...Just let me put this in my safe... Something wrong? That was a loud one wasn't it?  How's astronaut training? No.  I'm just being friendly. Whatever made you want to do a tour down here? Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something. You think I should hang around more with the crew? I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done. What's wrong? I know that. How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?  No, he's really sick...He won't be going out today. Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?  Thanks... Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one. Let's have her... Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder. Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?! I'm not a doctor. The mask is because you think it might be...catching?  And?  Why Sixpack?  Yeah...right... What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy. I'm not anxious to find out, either. Do it. What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow? But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!  Sixpack's dead. What?... I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms. No...she killed herself. There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...  Jones...  Stay here. Shut up, all of you. C'mon...Lift! Cobb!  Stop! No! Close the Lock!  Now! Hit it again! Flush it! I think we just found our problem. They found this? Was there such a thing? Not exactly a big ocean country. But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?  Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around? What has? Shut up, both of you!  We've got to find it. Where's Willie? Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms. I thought they were your friends? You fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place down. No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that? Big? That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.  That it acquires intelligence from its victims? Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other. Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.  I hear something. Don't fire until we're both in the Swamp. Don't let him see you. Run Willie!  Run!  Where's Cobb and Doc? C'mon. Lock the door. Shit!  He sent them all. Forty-eight hours! He's right.  Why don't you get some rest.  I'll stand the first watch.  Martin, you asshole...  Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us. What are you doing? I can't believe they'd just leave us. We're on backup air. Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct. They're drawing us out. We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--  Which way? I'll go first. Can you fix it? Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!  No. Hurry...Get out! Jones!  Get your feet out of the water! C'mon, the Swamp! Go on! That's an order! I got hung up!  Try this! The suits!  Get in them! Like this. Get them in the Lock! Just get in yours!  Go! Go, now!  That's an order! No! Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit... Where's Jones? We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one. I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare! I can't see them! Jonesy...Give me your hand! C'mon, Jones! Jonesy, No! C'mon, motherfucker open up!  I don't know yet, she's still in there. Better...A lot better."
legion,BOB ,Dennis Quaid," Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We got a special relationship here. Where ya been, Charlie? Bob steps off the chair. This ain't a resort you know.    I got orders stacking up here. In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it certainly makes Bob feel better to say it.  You best not be smokin' again.    Not in your condition. What?   I quit two years ago. It was a gift from my ex-wife, alright? I'm sentimental. I don't wanna forget how much I hate her guts. Goddamn it. Where the hell is Jeep? Hey, Leonardo...! Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to see his father standing next to the Anderson's broken-down Uhual. The fact that this truck's hood's up mean anything to you? Jeep stares at the ground.   Couldn't be anymore uncomfortable.nan Whaddya workin' on that's so goddamn important you're not doin' your job? Whaddya doin'? Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I think it's real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your responsibility. Don't walk away from me while I'm talkin' to you! How long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog? Cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you?! Jeep stiffens.   Turns to his father: You really think she's gonna stick around here after that baby's born and off her hands? Jeeps shakes his head, burns.  See that up there? Your mother thought I was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere...But I just knew this was what I was supposed to do. Told your mom, ""just wait."" Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station. Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that's never gonna happen...Or someone. Now get to work on that truck. I wanna have these people on the road by nightfall. Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north. Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the distant mountains. A storm is coming. (holding up a silencing What's wrong with you today? What the hell do I need that crap for? I got all the history I can take. What's your problem now? You know this was the top-of-the- line model when I bought it. You shouldn't be watchin' anyways.  Okay, baby, this is gonna do it. Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK! And the picture snaps into FOCUS.    Only it isn't the picture he was expecting. The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner. Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV. See?   Clear as day. It's just one of those test things. That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the screen, which read: In the back past the kitchen.   Make it fast. Kyle hustles passed Percy. Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes. Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV. Hey, Percy, give that old radio of yours a shot. Maybe they got some news about the TV. Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf. Switches it on. STATIC.   He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal. The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting.   Station after station the same thing. The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW TONES. Everyone goes very still. Not if it was centered in the desert. Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off. Well, for cryin' out loud. There's no use in speculating. I'll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard something. Whaddya talkin' about? You're shittin' me. Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter. Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited about. Probably just working on the lines. Sides, I'm sure Jeep'll have your truck fixed up quick as can be, and then you'll be on your way. (glances over at the That's not gonna happen.    Goddamn phone's out. What happened? Don't move! But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING (struggles to cock the The fuck was that?!   What the fuck was that!? Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult facade giving way to that of a frightened child A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An ungodly horror. I don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan. Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it. I swear I did. It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay. But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside. There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Jeep. (catching Percy by the The hell you need that for?! She's cold as a freakin' ice cube. If I hadn't just seen her walk in here, I'd say the old bag's been dead for hours. Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth. I don't get it.    Why don't they come closer? You see anything? Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there. Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell hits them. Jesus. Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.      Dark, dirty.   But nothing unusual. Least now we know where that smell was coming from. Okay, now we're talkin'. Give me the shotgun. Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob. Take one step closer and I'll drop you right here. A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold. Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your teeth. Michael stares at him blankly. Your teeth goddamn it!       Lemme see `em! Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others ease slightly. Okay... Suppose you tell us your name then. Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen anything like `em. Practically bit a man in half. Michael remains silent.       Doesn't seemed shocked in the least by what he's heard. So what are you doin' out here? Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again, you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car? Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the shotgun again. Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob: Back off, fella... Wait. I don't think that's such a good idea.  He's just a kid -- C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go! Jeep, get the flashlights! Alright, Rambo. You got us up here. Now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting? Michael is about to answer, when: Yeah...The hell is that? The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct. Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN. But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with dread. Shells! Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof. Fuck! With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. Stretching... Further... Gun! (jamming the gun in her Pull me up! Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety. Hold on. (approaches Michael, Right and yesterday I was the fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know, fuck this. I don't even believe in God. How do we know he didn't bring them here himself? Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed to be a vi-- On the house. She looks up at him.    Smiles weakly.   Takes a sip. You hungry? Well I figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve. All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas on. Sandra takes another sip of beer.   Considers it. Just gimme another minute with him, okay? Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead friend. What the hell are you talkin' about? This is our chance! We back in business? Jesus Christ, what the hell is that boy doin'! Damn it all to hell!  Get back! BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF Where the fuck is he?! A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST.    Everybody spins to track the location of the sound. What the fuck? What a way to bring a child into the world.  She ever tell you his name? Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her. Can't a father be wrong sometimes? Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound... A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed. I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be happening to you... Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears filling his eyes. Who? Don't do it, lady! Sonuvabitch! Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing. Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind him. But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she pulls the child protectively to her chest. Leave me, Jeep.     My place is here, remember? Run. And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says. Sorry...   We're closed. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO"
extract,JOEL ,Jason Bateman," You always give me free drinks though. DEAN Oh yeah. Well come by anyway. Yeah?... Might as well. No action going on at my house, that's for sure. DEAN Really? The wife out of town? No... I just haven't been laid in a month. No. This is pretty much normal these days... As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down through various stages of assembly line production, then follows several bottles of orange extract moving past HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short, beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he says sound as macho and important as possible. If I don't get home before about 8:00, she puts on the sweatpants and once the sweatpants are on, it's over -- I get nothing. (notices something down All right. Now, what's the problem? They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING. Okay! Okay, everyone settle down. Now Mary. Hector here is new okay? It's gonna take him a couple of days, maybe his English isn't so good. You gotta be patient. And Step, if you wanna be Floor Manager, this is the kind of thing you're going to have to deal with. Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's get this cleaned up, and get rolling again. We can't afford to fall behind today. Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts right back up with Gabriella. Jesus... They're like a bunch of goddamned children. Well, I guess he's got that band he's in too... Who, Mary? Look at 'em... I am so sick of baby sitting these assholes.  I better get going... Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about ""sweatpants.""  Please go back inside... Please just turn around.. .Come on...don't notice me... Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of in a hurry here. Yeah, in fact...  I should go right now actually. I gotta call the office before they leave. Ah, I don't ah... (realizes his should fake Ah... I'm sorry, I ah... I just don't think that's something we're gonna want to do. Oh, I don't know. Suzie doesn't really like going to stuff like Well, we wouldn't know anybody there. She get's kind of uncomfortable. I just don't... Um, why don't we talk about this later.  I gotta make this call before they leave. Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan to raise off the window sill. Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get inside and make this call. Let's talk about this another time. Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door, waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside. Man, that Nathan won't shut up. What? It's not the middle of the week. It's Monday. Why can't-- I gotta get a house with a bathroom that's doesn't share a wall with the TV. It would look suspicious. We never use those other bathrooms... Maybe if I had some insulation put in... But what do I have really? It's a big pain in the ass. I'm always working; can't stop or the whole place will fall apart. And what good does it do me anyway? I don't get laid. That stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably gets laid more than I do. Hell, I'd move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom wasn't right next to the TV. I thought you said he wasn't serious; he was just sniffing around. You're kidding. Wow... Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking down on the production floor. I could unload all this... I could probably retire... Tell 'em hell yes. (to the person on the Well, he's definitely lost one of 'em. They think they might be able to re-attach the other one, but they're not sure. Yeah... I'm not sure how it happened, but we have a great safety record and we comply with all the safety codes so... it was just a freak accident. There'll be an investigation of some kind I'm sure. Oh yeah. Of course. In fact, he'll probably get a huge settlement. Boy it really makes you stop and think about how fragile we are -- especially our balls. They're just hanging there in a little sack between our legs. At any moment they could be cut off forever. Yeah... Beat. You know Dean, my life wouldn't be much different than it is now actually. Except for once every three months when I have sex with my wife. In fact, I might even be better off... I did? I must've been lying. I don't know... Maybe things'll get better when I sell the company. I'll be around more... Ah, it's all right... What? Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety? No. For what? Are you on something now? Yeah, sure. How is Step? Really? They think it's that big of a liability? No, I guess not. Boy, Step sure is being mellow about all this. Boy, it sure does make you think.. Who? Brian, you call everyone here ""Dinkus."" I don't know who you're talking about. Oh... I thought you call him ""boy- genius."" You know Brian, you really ought to learn the employees' names. Yeah. She's a temp. No a temp. Quit staring. Hey, I didn't hire her. She came here through Manpower, like everybody else. They just sent her over. Yeah, I know. I guess it makes sense though if you think about it. Hot girls need a job just as much as anyone else. You wanna hear something really weird? She came on to me. Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I could be wrong, but... I don't know about that. Extract. And spray-dried flavoring, and we're branching out Well, first she started asking me about what happened to Step and all that stuff -- you know, just sort of making conversation? But it really seemed like she was flirting with me, you know? Then, she just sort of asked me out... I think. Well, you see that guy down there by the fork lift? ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc. His band is playing somewhere, at some party this weekend, and she asked me if I wanted to go with her. What? No. No way. I couldn't live with myself if I cheated on Suzie... It'd be nice if I got laid at home once in a while though... Yeah, I do sort of... We see a COMMOTION down on the floor. Mary runs out of the Women's locker room SCREAMING AND YELLING. Now wait a second. Calm down Mary. How do you know it was stolen? Well, what did it look like. I'm sick of it Dean. I'm sick of being turned down in my own house by my own wife. We're turning into one of those brother-sister couples.  Maybe things will be better after I sell the company... Or maybe it's just going to mean more time to sit around and contemplate not getting laid. Dean nods sympathetically. Yeah... she was really coming on to me. She gave me her phone number and everything. Told me to call her if I wanted to go to that party. Can you believe that? And there's nothing I can do about it, but just be sexually frustrated. No thanks... No, I can't. I can't cheat on Suzie. I just gotta power through it until I'm so old that I can't get it up anymore. Hmm... I hadn't even thought of that... No. I don't think it would actually.  I guess that's weird huh? But see, then I could do something about all this sexual frustration, without feeling guilty about it. Nah... Yeah, maybe. How? What? How do you know a gigolo? Come on Dean. You know, maybe I will try some of that Xanax. Dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a little box and pulls out a pill. Huh?  Ah, who cares? (beginning to slur his Do you think it would be wrong to do that? I mean morally wrong? I don't know... And this guy, he's a friend of yours? What's his name? I don't know. It's kinda weird even talking about it. Really? Yeah, I guess you're right... I don't know. It's crazy. Dean pours Joel another drink. Alright. What the hell. Joel takes a big swig of liquor. So it's two-hundred dollars then? What, so you're a pimp now? Alright, alright. Wait a minute-- Yeah? Brad looks at Joel, deeply concerned. No no no. God no! It's not like that. I won't even be there. I'll be at work. Remember? We already talked about this. Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it. What you'll do, is come to my house pretending to be the new pool cleaner. Then you simply try to seduce my wife. Okay? If she doesn't respond, you simply clean the pool and leave. That's all. It's that simple. Hold on Brad for a long beat. NO! Try to pay attention okay? I will not be there. I will be at work. You come over to my house while I'm not there, posing as the new pool cleaner and then try to seduce her... Brad finally makes a breakthrough. Yeah, that's right. Remember, she might not go for it-- Brad starts to get a little too excited. Are you sure about this guy Dean? He acts like he's never done this before. I don't know. He sure doesn't seem too bright. Oh shit! He runs out of the room. Dean? Thank God you're home. Ah,... did that really happen last night? I mean, did we go through with it -- with that gigolo stuff? Shit! What was I thinking?! We gotta call it off. Right now. Can you call that guy, Brad? Tell him I'll pay him anyway, whatever, just don't come over. God, what was I thinking?! What? I thought you called him last night. Well get it from him again. Shit! I'll try information. What's Brad's last name? Pause. Shit! Joel hangs up the phone, and rushes out the door. Not now Brian. Not now! We FOLLOW Joel as he rushes past his SECRETARY. I can't, I-- Joel stops suddenly. Who? Um, no... He's the ah, pool cleaner. I better take that. Joel goes back in his office. HOLD on Brian, confused. Hello? Yes. What do you mean? What? What're you...?  You weren't even supposed to be there for another 45 minutes.  So you mean she actually ah... you guys...? No. Tell me. Tell me how it happened. Yeah. Okay that's enough! Stop! I don't need to hear anymore. NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye. Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a state of shock.  Holy shit. Dammit ! JOEL'S POV: Nathan, the guy across the street is in his front yard, puttering around with the mail. Oh, I'm kind of busy actually. Look, ah, we can't go. Remember? Yeah, but remember, I told you we didn't really want to go to this thing. Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap. Look, I gotta get going. It sucks. Nothing. Suzie looks a little puzzled. They keep eating in silence for a beat. I don't feel well. I'm going to bed. I think Step is just chest-beating. He does this all the time. He gets all wound up, talks big, then he always backs down. And that's with his balls. Oh, hey Cindy. You can just call me Joel. Oh yeah. Right, that's tonight... Yeah, I was thinking about it. Are you going? Yeah, I think I'll probably go. I'm not sure... Um... Okay. Sure. Hi. I can't talk right now-- Look Nathan, I gotta... Wait, you mean yesterday, don't you? The new pool cleaner. You saw him yesterday right? Not today. What'd he look like? You sure it was today? Not yesterday? You're absolutely sure? What the hell were you doing at my house today?! Bullshit! Won't charge me for...? You had sex with my wife again?! Not gonna charge...? God damn you! Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm gonna pay you! You're not having sex with my wife for free! And I better not ever catch you anywhere near my house ever again! Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone, picks it back up and hits the ""End"" button. I can't believe my wife slept with that guy. I guess I didn't really think about it long enough... I just wish it hadn't been so easy for him. No, you're right. He may be a stupid, dull-witted moron, but he can get any girl he wants. Me, I had to work for it. I had to work hard, get a career going, take Suzie out a bunch of times, marry her. But not Brad. He gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that. Oh, and by the way? That little prick was at my house again today. Take a wild guess. I'm not going to let him do it for free. No way. I'm paying him. Oh, I don't know. The same, I guess. Why? I don't know... I feel weird about it. Besides, she's at the party, she probably won't be home 'til late.  I don't wanna do drugs Dean. I get paranoid when I smoke pot. Oh, wonderful. Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a light weight. I think that's too much for me-- Ah, what the hell. Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would. Umm, I think... no. You know, maybe I should just let What? Long pause. Oh, I thought somebody said something. Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then, in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face.  Yeah, heh heh... What time is it? Alright. Joel gets the phone number out of his pocket. Oh, she's got brown hair. Pretty hot. Kind of working-class looking... Umm... Oh you know,... Yeah... Beat. Joel's not sure if that was the right answer either. Yeah... I hope I don't wake her up... Yeah. Still busy... Man, what kind of person doesn't have call-waiting. Huh? But... Beat. Oh... You're joking right? Trying to make me paranoid? Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn't. He just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR UNLOCK. Everyone looks. CINDY enters. I'm fine. I'm fine. I just ah... got my ass kicked. Go back to sleep. It was just... some guy over at Scoreboards. No. I'll be fine. I just want to sleep right now, okay? He isn't returning my calls. Oh, I fell down some stairs. (clutches his head Ah... no. No he--! But... Step? Does he even know her? What?! Really? Fire Hector? What for? No. Don't fire him. Just trust me on this. Give him another week. If anything else is stolen, then you can fire him. Okay, thanks. Hello. Uh-huh. He did take a swing at me Dean. Several swings. In fact, he beat the living shit out of me. Yes. I'm not feeling well. I'm going to go home early. Shit! Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out of their vehicles. Joel is livid. What the hell were you doing on my street again?! (trying to improvise a tough, snappy comeback, but can't quite make it The same thing that's gonna happen.. Your face is gonna look worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever catch you anywhere near my house or my wife again, I'll have you arrested. What the hell is wrong with you anyway? Do you do this with all your clients -- just keep coming back and hanging around? What?! I thought you were a professional! In love?! Oh, you don't think so ""dude?"" Well did you ever think about this: she doesn't even know that I paid you to have sex with her -- did that cross your small mind? How about I go home right now and tell her? Tell her you did it for the money. How about that loverboy? Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out. You don't think so? Watch me. Don't mess it up?! You're talking about my wife! My house! Stupid- ass! Joel gets in his car and starts it. Oh yes I can... Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his driveway. So how was that new pool cleaner? Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but she plays it cool. What do you think I mean?... Did he do a good job cleaning the pool? Did he get all the... leaves? It doesn't really look that clean. I mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the guy even clean it at all? It sure doesn't look like it. I think he did a horrible job. I don't think we should use him anymore. Okay. Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face. No.  Yeah, I don't think so. I would've remembered... Hi... Hey Step, can we talk in another room. Oh, no... No, I'm just kind of curious about... ah... So you've been going out with Cindy, huh? .so some of the guys at work are saying you gave Cindy that black eye. Yeah, I know it's not. Hmm... Look, you might wanna be careful with Cindy. Well, I'm not sure how to put this, but... You know, you got a lot of money coming your way with this settlement. You might wanna be You sure about that? Yeah... You sure about that? Oh. Hmm... Well, okay... If you say so. Another thing -- you just might want to watch your back. Some of the guys at work who think you gave Cindy the black eye were talking about paying you a visit -- you know, getting even. Huh? Oh shit... Alright. Joel drags himself out of the chair. What!!!? (so pissed he can barely get the words out) We don't have this much money! Not even close! What the ff-- Are you shitting me!? That would bankrupt us! If you think I'm just going to give up this entire company that I built from the ground up-- Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation. It was an accident! I don't wanna slam my testicles in the door! I want you to be reasonable! You won't even budge one penny! Come on! I'll slam your balls in the door! I don't need this. I'm going home. Yeah?... What? But they are ill-prepared. No one knows who should talk first. It's incredibly awkward. They all look at each other and mutter things like, ""go ahead"" ""you first"". Finally... You know what? Fine. Fine. You're all in charge -- all of you. (gestures to all the You banged the pool cleaner. That's what you're trying to tell me right? You had sex with Brad? Yes I knew. I hired him. I don't mean I hired him to clean the pool, I mean I hired him to have sex with you. He's a gigolo Suzie. Suzie is stupefied. I hired him to have an affair with you so that I could have an affair without feeling guilty. I was really drunk and on some kind of horse tranquilizer and-- FIFTEEN TIMES?! Jesus Christ Suzie! Joel sinks into his chair, shaking his head. I only paid him once -- well, twice. The rest was on the house. Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in. Yes. But I didn't. Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all this. Then, decisively, Oh, I'm the asshole? Okay. I'll admit, I made a big mistake. I was drunk, on drugs, stressed, sexually frustrated and I shouldn't have hired a male prostitute to seduce you. But if you had simply been faithful, none of this would've happened. Suzie just looks at him for a beat. What do you see in Brad anyway? He's borderline retarded. You probably could've been arrested for having sex with a guy that dumb. No. You're not leaving me. I'm leaving you! I couldn't kick your ass if I wanted to. You're a good 10 years younger than me, and I'm a pussy. So why don't you just leave me alone. Why'd you have to get hung up on Suzie? You could have any girl you want. You had her fifteen times. Well... You told me. Hey Brad?... Brad stops. I don't know... Maybe come by the office tomorrow. Fill out an application. I'll see what I can do.  So I don't sell the company, don't get the money, I'm bankrupt, I don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to have sex with my wife, and she actually did it... Nothing. Hi. Ah, actually, I'm staying here too. Down on the first floor, around the back. I thought I saw you so I ah... No thanks. Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke. That's Mary's purse... Isn't it? Right there. That's Mary's purse. That's Mary's purse. You stole it, didn't you? I've never seen another one. You probably have Sylvia's wallet in here somewhere too, don't you? And everything else that's been stolen from my employees. No, I'm not. That's Mary's purse Goddammit! Okay? Everyone blamed Hector. He almost got fired. Doesn't that bother you? Hector! Hard working guy, never did anything wrong. And what are you doing with Step? You're trying to screw him out of his settlement money aren't you? Yes you do! You're the only reason he's suing us aren't you? You know how much work it took for me to build up that company? You just don't care about anybody do you? What are you, some kind of sociopath? Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her. You can't even admit that you stole this purse can you? You just can't do it. In fact, you probably can't tell the truth about much of anything, can you?... Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor. I bet Cindy's not even your real name is it? Who are you? Where the hell are you from? Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer. You can't answer can you? Because if you said one true thing, you'd have to tell the truth about something else and then it would all unravel wouldn't it? Then you'd have to admit that you stole this purse and God knows what else. Beat. Cindy still looking away, down at the floor. We see her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice. And I'm taking this purse with me. If it really is yours, you can call the police and tell 'em I stole it... In fact, I'm gonna call the police and report it... Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor, her voice cracking slightly. What? Well... Maybe you should've thought about that before you started ripping off my employees. Joel starts to open the door. How do I know that? Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's watch? Can I get those too? Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it. Well... Okay then. I guess that works. So what's your deal anyway?... I mean, how did you end up like this? Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's caught off guard. .Ah... Cindy? Cindy breaks down and starts bawling. Okay, now you see... that's what I'm talking about. You're trying to manipulate me now, and I'm not gonna fall for it... Cindy starts bawling even harder. I really hope you're not faking this right now, because I'm feeling really bad. Are you faking it? Cindy shakes her head ""no."" I'm sorry, I was just curious, you know, how a person ends up like... this... Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically. Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or comfort her in any way. Never mind. I'm sorry... Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she leans in to him, crying on his chest. He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start kissing. As they get hot and heavy we Cindy? He looks around, realizes he's alone. Then suddenly looks worried. Oh shit! He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants, then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse, Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side. He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again. Here you go Mary. And by the way, Hector didn't take it. Cindy did. Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She whispers to Gabriella. Really? Bring him in. Hi Step... How you doin'? How's your, ah... Well... that's good. They both sit down on the edge of the dock. Wow... Bummer... Yeah, he sure is. Yeah... I'm beginning to think I might be the same way... I'm a little worried about what I'd do with too much time on my hands. Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse. You don't have to bankrupt the company. Well, maybe I don't have to sell the company... You know I've been thinking; all these years I've been building this company, dreaming about the day I could sell it and retire, but what would I really do if I retired? It's like that old saying -- it's not about the destination, it's about the journey? Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him. I guess what I'm saying is, too much free time might not be such a good thing -- like that old saying, idle hands are the Devil's playground? Step's never heard that one either. What I'm saying is, I'm thinking maybe I won't sell the company... that is, if you dropped the lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll still get that insurance money -- probably a couple hundred thousand. What do you think? What's that? Deal. They shake hands. Hold the line! Mary shuts off the conveyer belt. Okay, listen up everybody.  I've decided not to sell the company... Gasps and murmurs among the employees. And I'm making Step the new Floor Manager. More gasps and murmurs. And if anyone doesn't like it, I hear they're hiring over at Gemco... But just remember, at Gemco, the owner doesn't know your names; you never even meet him, he's at an office up in Chicago somewhere and you get an auto- response if you try to email him to complain about anything. Here, you can come up to my office any time you have a problem. Thanks. Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him. It's about the journey Brian. The journey. ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up. Hi... You doing okay? I heard you were right there when it happened. That must've been rough. It's okay, it's not your fault... It's not your fault. Suzie's crying subsides a little. Yeah, I know... I know... But we probably won't. It'll be alright. Suzie starts to regain her composure. They stand there for a beat. You wanna go get something to eat... or something? Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little. Here... Maybe we should've been married in a Church like that one. Instead of the Botanical Gardens. Yeah, but... a church just seems more -- I don't know -- official. I don't know... So, are we still married? I mean otherwise. Alright. They walk for a beat. You know, this is really bad, but... Oh never mind. Well, as I was looking down at Nathan there, I was thinking... That's the longest I've ever seen him with his mouth shut. Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself."
manhunter,GRAHAM ,Kim Greist," I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions? What else did you keep out of the papers? Somebody hurt him? No. The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack. That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing. I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that. I am all right. As long as they're dead... Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat. What did he want? And you said? I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything. We have it good, don't we? What the hell can I do? If I were?  I don't care. (beat> He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence. Yeah. .. In this hatchery? Forty to fifty. Yeah, but not now.. These will all make it... guaranteed.  Thanks for the lift. That's right.  Thanks. intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him.  The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot... All her other injuries were post-mortem. (beat> Then he went toward the children's room.  Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray.;. With his throat cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the children's room...  in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot...  Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained... as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, believed to be post-mortem. What did the killer do with them after they were dead? And before he put the boys back in their beds? There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog?  When they were dead -- except possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs. Leeds... What did he do in the interval? Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute. What else?  Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead?  Molly? It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...  You moved the kids after you killed them, didn't you? Did you arrange them for your performance with Mrs. Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr. Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the postmortem ligature on his chest. Did you make them your audience? Did you open their eyes? There is something you can't afford for me to know about. Isn't there? Mrs. Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was maddening to have to wear gloves when you touched her, wasn't it?  There was talcum powder on her leg. There was no talcum powder in the bathroom.  The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints? He is good. Bur not as good as Price. Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes. The report didn't mention nails and eyes. Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you? Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead. He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse. That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot. Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. I call him a monster. (cold right turn> What about the dog? Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it? Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog? Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.  Keep the fuck away from me! ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...  Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index. I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me. We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him. He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time. You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop. Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.  ... I'm going to see Lecter.  To recover the mind set. Hey, baby! Where are you? None you'd notice. I'm lonely... Tell me about yourself.  Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin? Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it... Z don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. I have to see somebody.  Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow. Blue, then. Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit- brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby. .. I love you... I'm not a doctor.  I need to see Lecter in as much privacy as possible. TWO SHOT Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of Staff, but not gifted. I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. No.  I want to see Lecktor now. I keep getting it for Christmas. I got it. Thank you. Stuart is fine. No. Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Very interesting, even to a layman. You've read the transcript. It's all there. It's in the transcript. What does it matter now? I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor. It's about Atlanta and Birmingham. You read about it, I'm sure. I thought you would have some ideas. There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...? You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for. No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are. You had disadvantages. You're insane. I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... Yes. Yes. No. Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor. sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees: Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why? That's interesting. Yes. I'd considered it. I want your opinion. When you do have one I'd like to hear it. I haven't decided yet. No. Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.  Block her off, Mitch... Have any single men asked to look at it? Uh-uh.  ... after you killed the cat and threw it into the yard, my man, you climbed up hero and waited. You used a cutting tool on these branches so you could see. You watched the children and passed the time whittling and dreaming.  When night came, you saw them passing their bright windows and you watched the shades go down, and you saw the lights go out one by one. And after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?  DIDN'T YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU WATCHED THEM ALL GODDAMN DAY LONG! !  That's why you like houses with big yards, the easier to see them I'm sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust for prints.  I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving. Then I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch. I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used. The mark? Yes. Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds? Who did he ask for? ...so how do I play him, Sidney?  This is Will Graham. Can I help you? I don't understand. Do you know something about that? I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things . Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you? Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in? He's right-handed. He's misunderstood. He's very strong physically. He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet. I don't want to do that, You tell me. You have a man in custody?  Yeah. I'm preferring charges! Obstruction of justice. You lock that asshole up. You hold him for the U.S. Attorney! You...  What is it? Where did you get it?! Can you read it to me? After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now? How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious? Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man. Ninhydran? Boosted with heat? The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply. He doesn't have anything to cut with. We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it... Personal ads? In thirty-five minutes. Bowman? Will Graham, Jack Crawford... Read it. That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me... Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor... Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time. Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper? And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon . Run it. We will feel sick for a very long time. Who is it? What'd it say? Tell me now. Get me a plane... Get me a plane! I won't be here. ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.  What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he? Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping . No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are. We don't know that. No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs. Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them. With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was.., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait . Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him. I kept thinking there must be some way I could have handled it better. It kept replaying in my mind. Later I got depressed. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked me to go into a hospital. After a while I got some distance on it and was okay. No. ...after a while.nan Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in the world. Huh? Slick as hell. I remember. Yes. I said this is too good to live... You don't recommend what, Sidney? If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it? Sidney, he doesn't read the ""Sunday Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the ""Tattler.""  And I want this over with... Fast. I believe he's socially maladjusted. Laughed at by his contemporaries... He's not as intelligent.  What have we missed? The killer has sexually molested all his male victims. He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex.  Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life .  And probably had sexual relations with his mother... All right. Let's shoot the pictures . Keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus. He has to be able to read it, but it can't look too obvious. No. Pretty well. Glaser Safety Slugs? Kevlar Second Chance. Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times' Let's walk the route.  God-dammit!!!  You haven't smoked in two years. No. I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you. No. Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time. I have to go back to Birmingham. No. I have to be. in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks. You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards... Molly.  I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile... And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over. Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...! I'm sorry, too... Coffee ... It's just YOU and me now, sport. And I'd better hurry up and find you.  Because I'm losing all this... I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes. What's it narrow down to?  That's narrow? When I'm done. It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson? Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too... Yes. Is Molly there? I know... 'Out in the good air...' Tell her I called. What do you want? I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it. Fight what? I don't believe in God. Why does it feel good? I enter. The glass cutter. I lick the suction cup. The piece of glass I take out is mine. House is mine .  I walk up these stairs. I pass childrens' toys. The children mean nothing to me... I am soundless. I move to the door. I step into the room... You will be better than anything... anything I have ever known. As I see me in your eyes.., as I see me accepted there. Reflected there in mirrors .  And you, you are the fuel for my changing... as this event becomes one more step towards what I am becoming that is different than what I have ever been before...  As I see me, accepted by you, in the silver mirrors of your eyes... He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important. It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again... How do I know?! He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses,  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him. There has to be.  He's a very shy boy... Something Lecktor said. It's not over yet.  You wanna watch this or what?! That's why the boltcutter. He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door? You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered? Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday party was April fourteenth. Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they changed the door.  But you can't see either family's door from the street. He wouldn't know until he got to the house that the padlock wasn't there anymore...  From the alley he couldn't have seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door . There's a lattice porch back there, but he was ready with his glasscutter.  So he was either casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough or...  Don't talk to me!! It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom? Have one of the guards down there call me. Do it.  You knew that was the Jacobis' cat ...  You brought a boltcutter... 'cause you thought there was a padlock...  And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar... But you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?!  See the woman? The bloom on the woman. You can almost feel her.  You can see her again and again. Anytime you want.  The doggy doesn't have a collar. But you know the Leeds' dog, don't you?  And you know the Jacobi cat. And the padlock on the door and you know you need a boltcutter and every other goddamn thing 'cause...  YOU'VE SEEN THESE FUCKING FILMS!  Haven't you, my man?  We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.  What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri. Have him peel the top label back. It does, doesn't it? Parking permits... Run these names to your DMV for a driver's license check. Man we're after is blond, caucasian, twenty to forty, six feet tall, 180-225 pounds.  First name... ... Alvaro. A.L.V.A.R.O., first name Jose.  No.  Put it through the datafax. Fast.  Route three, Chester, Missouri. Where is that?  This is our boy...! Go on to the house. Go on to the house...  What? Cut across the field.  Kill your lights. How far away's the back-up? I'll cover the back.  There's somebody in the house, Jack  It's happening again, Jack...  ... stop it.  STOP IT!!!  Hello. Mama was probably asleep. Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you. Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to... Come home with me. What's this Mama shit? What's the problem, Molly? Small difference: I'm not dead, yet . They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me... Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick... Yeah. That's great. A little time. (beat I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around. Yes . Are you George Sherman? No, that's okay...  How are you? No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ... stop by and... I just wanted to stop by and... see you... I guess. That's all. You got a deal... We did okay.  Most of them made it..."
jaws_2,BRODY ,Marc Gilpin," Late. Couldn't help it. Hendricks over there... (he indicates his deputy) ...still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket, and I couldn't find the spares. How'm I supposed to do that?  Shouldn't he be at home?  Do I have to talk to those two? Very impressive ceremony. Good speech. Me neither. All of us thank you, okay? No. Find your brother, okay? Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man? Because they're playing our song. Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear. Remember 1959, the Jersey shore? I did, I did. Listen -- what are you doing later? Right. Home it is.  You're getting a little big for this. Mmmm. Sean's awake.  Good. Mrs. Silvera? Need a ride? Some people. Better yet. Too late, it's written. Len, pay the two dollars.  Aren't you off-duty? What? On your own time? Then check it out. I'll be in the office. Where to? Sailing? Watch your kid brother, huh? I'll do what I can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction... Thanks. What else is out there? I'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others. In a minute, in a minute -- talk to Mrs. Prendergast, please...  Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney. Dancing? Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908. I just made it up. It means, ""Get me out of there.""  What the hell's that? Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that. If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel. Hendricks, get a description of that dance. There should be bodies. Witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one skiing. Try dragging. Stay on it. I don't care how long it takes. Oh, yeah. Sure. It's good with coffee. What're you guys doing today? Every day? You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school. You'll have to make up your own mind about that. In the den. There's a lot going on. Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat. He's another one. Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating? What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up old cars? Bartending? Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day? Look, humor the old man -- just be careful. Don't go out if it's rough or anything, huh? We've had a lot of trouble. You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay? I'll be at the office. As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big! See? What'd I tell you? Look at that! Come on, let's check the bite radius. Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth? The Shark's mouth. The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it? But that's what we're here to find out, right?  You stay here a minute. You heard me. Look, I know a little bit about sharks. I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan... That's it. Is there one in these waters? Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish... Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this. That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around...  Sound? So there's one around here. Could you just keep that crowd back, please? You stay right here. You're going in with me. Andy can sail in it. She'll understand. I don't want to discuss it. Can't you tell? Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy... No more sailing. You come back with me, and that's it. Because I say so. We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone. Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one. Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator... I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you? We have to do something. I know, I know... It's still a good idea. Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers... Two of them are still missing! Maybe they are!  Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it! Someone has to do something. Come on, give a guy a break. Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa... Hoo! Cold!  Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You bastard. A little closer... Here y'go...  Gotcha! In here. You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess. The woman passenger on the boat that blew up. What about that camera? That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it? Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it... You got it. Not the drugstore! The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it? Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?  Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone. For me? Damn. Not till next year. Oh, hi -- How was dinner?  Santos' place. Oww! Nothing. That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff? Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal. No. Michael. You want to come here a minute? Hiya yourself. I got something for you to do tomorrow. Sailing?  Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats. No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts. He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night. Tomorrow night. Out of the water. I know what you're going to say.  In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune? The goddamn smell is always the same. (he shudders at the recollection) Yeah. I think so.  Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!  Out of the water! Everyone out of the water! Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get out! Now! Out of the water! Out of the water! Now! Everyone! No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear! Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm... Okay, it's all over, go on, it's over. No trouble... It's all right, everything's all right... Polly, no calls, please...  Okay, okay.  Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What pictures... I'll be right down... You said something about a camera.  Did you get any pictures? Oh, Jesus. That boat... What else you got? Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.  That one there. That one... Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof! Perfect. Look at this ---  What? Temporarily? Uh... sure... The question's out of left field. Why are they asking? Yeah. Why? Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along. It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, it's right there! What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills. You're damn right that's what it is.  What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand? I've seen this sonofabitch before! My ass! There is nothing to discuss. Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary. Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way. It means I don't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever! Go ahead, whatever it's worth. That's great. That's great too. Gorgeous. You look about 22 years old sitting there. Like you were doing homework... Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all. What'd I say? Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that.  No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water... Ridiculous. Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture... He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me...  ...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York... tell him to kiss my ass... Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw... I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, I'm tired... I can't keep fighting it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm... Good morning, America... Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss. Don't rush into it -- we may need the income. Mike left early. Couldn't wait to make out. Must be a morning man. The sink upstairs is busted. Try some Drano, or a plunger, maybe. Or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name... Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs an apprentice. Just one minute... What the hell happened? How'd this happen? When? How long ago? Going out. You can't stop me. Mike's out there. Untie that rope. Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there. Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you said something about the lighthouse. Get us there. Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over. Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne? Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now. There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port. That's it. Just do it, all right? If they're not at the light, look for them. I don't want them out there. Get them back to port! It's not his boat.  Nope...  Hold on... Tina! It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey -- What is it? What's there?  I need a hand here... I knew it. I goddamn well told them. Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol. Skip that. What about those kids out sailing? He left them? Get him the hell back there! We got possible fatalities! Brody out... I'm going out there. Mike's out there.  Get her in. Get them both in. Where are they? Never mind that shit. Just point. Got it.  Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One. Harbor Air, where are you? It's me. Any fix on those Kids? For Christ's sake, get going! I'm all alone out here! Where the hell is Francis Shoal? I'm all alone out here. Shit. Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, come in. Harbor Air, do you read? Over? Where the hell is Air One? Did he raise the Kids? Yeah? Then what? Did you say Cable Junction? When? Thank Christ. I'm coming alongside! Mike? Is that you? It's okay. What happened? At least you're safe. What about the others? Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others? What? Which way? Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here. Stay at the lighthouse! Hang on! I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay... Can you get a line to me? Son of a bitch is stuck! Come on, you bastard, come on, pull. Pull! Sean! Hang on! Hang on! Just hang on! I'm coming! Andy! Use the lights! The lights! Sean! You bastard! Come here, you son-of-a-bitch! Over here! You bastard! Over here Come and get me! Come and get me! Sean? Sure they did..."
juno,JUNO ,Ellen Page," It started with a chair. Yeah. Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob for a second, okay? This is the most magnificent discarded living room set I've ever seen. I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign. I remain unconvinced. Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto. Jesus, I didn't say it was. Oh, and this too.  I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy. I am a suicide risk. No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?  Dude, I'm pregnant. It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout. I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier. Unfortunately, yes. That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take. I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now. Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent. That is sick, man. Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant. Like, a year ago, in Spanish class. It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state. It was magnificent, man! Hey Bleek. Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick. Your shorts are looking especially gold today. Go Carole.  So, guess what? I'm pregnant. When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time. I know. I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant. So that's cool with you, then? I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea. I'll see you at school, O.K.? Yeah. The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo secretly wants me. Jocks like him always want freaky girls. Girls with horn-rimmed glasses and vegan footwear and Goth makeup. Girls who play the cello and wear Converse All-Stars and want to be children's librarians when they grow up. Oh yeah, jocks eat that shit up. They just won't admit it, because they're supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders like Leah. Who, incidentally, is into teachers. Well! Nothing like experimenting. Oh, I couldn't copy your work. Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh? Charisma? So, who's ready for some photomagnificence? Snow Peak Peach is the best flavor of Boone's. Right, Bleek?  ""Para instruciones en Espanol, oprima numero dos."" Yes, hello, I need to procure a hasty abortion?... What was that? I'm sorry, I'm on my hamburger phone and it's kind of awkward to talk on. It's really more of a novelty than a functional appliance. Better? Okay, good. Yeah, as I said, I need an abortion, two... sixteen... Um, it was approximately two months and four days ago that I had the sex. That's a guestimate. Okay, next Saturday? Great. I hate it when adults use the term ""sexually active."" What does that even mean? Can I deactivate someday, or is this a permanent state of being? I guess Bleeker went live that night we did it. I guess he hadn't done it before, and that's why he got that look on his face. My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona... ...with her new husband and three replacement kids. Oh, and she inexplicably mails me a cactus every Valentine's Day. And I'm like, ""Thanks a heap, Coyote Ugly. This cactus-gram stings even worse than your abandonment."" That's my stepmom, Bren... She's obsessed with dogs... ...owns a nail salon called Bren's Tens... ...and she always smells like methylmethacrylate. Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes? I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it. Uh, hi Su-Chin. Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet? You should try Adderall. Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, ""Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"" Well, it was nice seeing you. Really? Fingernails? Hi. I'm here for the big show? Juno MacGuff. She thinks I'm using a fake name. Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa. No thank you. I'm off sex. Congrats. I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails! I'm staying pregnant, Le. What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos. I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless. Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break. There are ads? For parents? Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch. The Penny Saver sucks.  There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard. No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as ""wholesome."" I'm looking for something a little edgier. I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular. Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids! They were Mark and Vanessa Loring, and they were beautiful even in black and white. Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with motion lotion. Just kidding (kind of.) Your best friend, Juno. I have no idea how to spit this out. No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion. No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me. I'm pregnant. But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people. They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened. I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning! The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly. Oh. It's, well, it's Paulie Bleeker. What?  No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair. Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years. But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend. Well, I'm not ready to be a mom. Once! And she didn't die, if you recall! No. Cool it. The term ""deliver"" is so weird. Can we not say ""deliver""? Sure, Dad. I have no idea what kind of girl I am. Vanessa, right? Sure. Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?  Geeeerta Rauuuss! No. A Maker's Mark, please. Up. I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk. I'm a junior. Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks. Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4. Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front. Well, you're lucky it's not you. Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right? Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds. Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid. Shit, yeah. Close it up. Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped. Mark, are you looking forward to being a dad? Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit. Room with a toilet, got it. Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here. Did your wife send you up here to spy on me? Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know. I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy. Smell those sparkling topnotes! You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in... Blood and guts.  Wait a minute. Is that a Les Paul? Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark. It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender. I rock a Harmony. What? I'm a pawn shop rocker. What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?  Yeah. When was this, like '96? Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic. Your guitar is named Kimber? That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio. Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking. Yeah. For sure. I like you guys. I'm going to say I'm 104% sure. Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know? Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything. I'll try to drop by later. Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!  It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things. No way. No, I definitely don't want to know. I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and if I know, I won't be able to keep myself from telling them and ruining the whole thing. No, they're the people who are adopting the baby. How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters? Bren, you're a dick! I love it. I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here? Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck. Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices? Why aren't you at work? No shit. Like Johannes Brahms? Like what? Oh.  Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch! You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say? Come on, you're going to want to sit down for this. Park it, dude. Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child. I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie. No, he's the dad. The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise. That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk. You know... it's parts...  Yeah? Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready. What is it?  I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes. Hey, I like this. You don't have to do that. I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.  The Wizard of Gore? Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.  Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.  This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark. So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?  Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay? My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross. Uh, thanks. I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys. Why? What the big deal? I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage. Hi Vanessa! Nothing... I went to the doctor today. Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this... This is the baby. Your baby.  Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying ""Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"" I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises. See? Nothing to worry about. Hey, what kind of swag did you score? I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous. Why? What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you? You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events. Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again. I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours. They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did! I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool. Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married. You don't know anything about me!  We don't even have a dog! Wow, dream big! Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive once. But now she looks a hobbit. The fat one that was in The Goonies. I borrowed Paulie's physics notes in school today. I'm pretty sure he needs them back, or his grade could plummet to an A minus. Hey, don't concentrate so hard, man. I think I smell hair burning. I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights. Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice. When we made out, the day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious. Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents. The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today. I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe. I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge? Jesus, Bleek. Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go. Were we together? What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort. I totally heard you did. Share the love, Tits!  She's assaulting me! She's denying me fresh-baked goodness!  Hly shht!  That's her. That's Vanessa Loring. You sound shocked or something.  Wah-wah-waaah! Right, seriously. I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously. Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today? Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged. Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now! Dude, it's moshing all over.  It's kicking. Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale. Oh, you should try talking to it. They can apparently hear speech in there, even though it sounds all ten thousands leagues under the sea.  Elbow. So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me. I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute. Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison. Consider it your musical education. Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi. Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked. Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode. God, why is everyone always staring at me? Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once! Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as ""Keith,"" okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days. Eww, he's all beardy! Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date. Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup! There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands. Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends. I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all. Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore. Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort? Leah just told me you were going with her. Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me. I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday... Whatever. Have fun at the prom with Soupy Sales. I'm sure I can think of something way more cool to do that night. Like I could pumice my feet, or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church, or get hit by a ten-ton truck full of hot garbage juice. All those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you.  What? That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember? Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you? Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time! I still have your virginity! What? Are you ashamed that we did it? Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet! Huh? Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?  Is Vanessa here? Cool. Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful! Oh God, you're one of those guys... ""Most Fruitful Yuki""? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero! Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now. Okay, how about some tunes? Now this first one is kinda slow. But it's Mott the Hoople so it's still totally rad and hardcore. What? You do? That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with? Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork! Oh, okay. Like this.  Only squares and nerds go to dances. I don't know.  What?  No. No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no! This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!  I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!  But you're old! I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life. Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me? Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying. Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife. Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes! Oh and by the way, I bought another Sonic Youth album and it's the worst thing I've ever heard! It's just noise, man! Nothing. I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later. I never realize how much I like being home unless I've been somewhere really different for a while. Hi Dad. Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone? Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs. Yeah, she does. I'm losing my faith in humanity. I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good. Yeah, like people in love. Dad, no! Please stop now. Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years. I sort of already have. I need to go out somewhere for just a little while. I don't have any homework, and I swear I'll be back by ten. Yeah. That was me.  Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint. You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you. Also, I think I'm in love with you. No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try. No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, ""Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard""? And it said, ""I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here""? That was hilarious. Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard. I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you. Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend. That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude. Okay. Dad! Either I just pissed my pants or... Thundercats are go!  Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing? You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now? It really didn't hurt that bad having him. The best part was when I peed on Leah during labor. And then, out of nowhere, there it was... There he was. I decided to not call Bleeker to tell him that I was having the baby. He had a big meet against Manteno and I didn't want him to get all worried about me and choke. But he figured it out anyway. Bleeker decided he didn't want to see the baby. Neither did I, really. He didn't feel like ours. I think he was always hers. It ended with a chair. As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss. He is the cheese to my macaroni. I know people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce, but normalcy's not really our style. Ready? Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you. The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you."

Diagnostics are green. Linking to communications card. Ready for data reception. If this works, when we touch down tomorrow, I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks. OK, here we go... Booting comm card now. Please confirm link.  Houston, please confirm reception of data. MISSION CONTROL  Negative. We're not seeing any data. Stand by, Houston. I'm gonna reboot the comm card. Comm card reboot in progress. Houston, I'm fine, it's just...  ...Keeping your lunch down in zero G is harder than it looks. MISSION CONTROL Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer? No, we've been here for a week Houston, let's just finish this. Card is up. Try again. Houston, could you please turn that music off? Thank you, Kowalsky. Now, Houston? MISSION CONTROL Negative. Could Houston be misinterpreting the data--? Mmmm. Let me see what's going on.  What have you got here? Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components. The problem must be originating in the comms panel. I'm on it. An hour. Assistance appreciated. Certainly. Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble dried. Whoa...! AWOL! Thanks. Sorry. In my basement lab things usually fall to the floor. Matt puts the bolt away. He begins to unscrew another bolt. Call me a genius if I can get this board initialized in the next hour. Should we be worried? Explorer, engage arm and pivot to cargo bay. I was just happy that they didn't cut the funding to my research. Six months. Assuming it works, it's just for hospital use. This one is a prototype. My eyes are brown. Mm-hm. The silence.  I could get used to it. Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead. Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary? MISSION CONTROL You're the expert, doctor. It's your call. Proceeding to over ride. I can't. If I turn it off now we'll lose the whole system. ONE SECOND-- Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done. Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine o'clock. Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster transport. Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area. Explorer get me down. I'm trying... It's stuck! Nooooo! No.  Ok. Ok. I'm trying. I'm trying. Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck, Hold on. I don't know. I don't know! I'm spinning. I can't. I can't. GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I can't. I told you! Nothing. I see nothing!

With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle is at the center of the dial. I can see the Chinese station. No, no, no, it's the International Space Station. ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock. Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy? Explorer, do you copy? Houston, do you copy? Houston, this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm drifting. Do you copy? Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy.  Lieutenant Kowalsky?... YES! YES! I copy! I'm here! My light? Here! Here! I'm... I'm alright... I'm fine. MATT  Your status! Give me your readings? 3.6 psi, I think. Steady at eight percent...no seven... Copy. Please hurry. Oh. Sorry. Arghh! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it. NO-- No... No... No... Wait... Don't. Nooooooo!!!! Dammit!!! Ahh Dammit! Ahhh Dammit. FUCK Why aren't they answering? Can they hear us on an alternate frequency? MATT We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes. Why ninety? 02 down to six percent. Yeah. Pretty scary shit. Where is he? Where is he? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm trying. I'm trying. I got him. I got him. 02 down to five percent. I apologize for not complying. I should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to. Yes? Agreed. 02 down to two percent. What? Home? Lake Zurich. I don't know... The radio. I listen to the radio... Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as they don't talk. I just drive... No... I had a daughter. Sarah... She was four. Stupidest thing- a school trip to the swimming pool. She was playing tag- she slipped, hit her head, and that was it... She loved tag. I'm sure she was laughing. When I received the call I was driving and ever since that's what I do. I wake up, I go to work and then I just drive. 02 down to one percent. MATT Well, well, what d'you know. I have good news and bad news. Uhuh? Mmm...Mmmm. I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure is low... Shouldn't we be turning? We're DRIFTING AGAIN-- Break... You have to break. I got it. I got it. The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm I'm detached. I've got you. I've got you-- No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you. Don't. Don't. NO Gotcha! What? No-- No! I'm not letting you go! We're fine. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. No! I had you! I had you. My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm went off. Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it. Yes. Ok. Sunday drive...? Ok. Only on a simulator. I crashed it. I-- Every time. I crashed the Simulator every time. I'm going to take the Soyuz and come get you. But... I... I'm... I'm going to make it. Dad wanted a boy. Not yet. What? MATT Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes. You... you have beautiful... you have beautiful blue eyes. What? No... I'm coming to get you.  Matt... Matt! Come on, come on. OK. Where are you? Where are you? Comms. Comms... There you are! Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? She waits. Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? Matt, I made it. I'm here. I'm inside the Station... Do you copy? Come on Matt. Talk to me.  Tell me where you are.  Give me your position... Where are you? Give me a visual... tell me what you see. Oh, come on. You've been yammering nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral, and now you decide to shut up? Come on Matt, talk to me! Say something... Anything. Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me about the hairy guy. What happened? Waiting for him to respond, and in a softer voice, completely RESIGNED- Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this. Houston in the blind. This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the ISS... All communication with Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio transmission is absent. Visual is nonexistent.  To confirm, I--Ryan Stone--am the sole survivor of STS-157. What now? AND THEN- OK... where was it?... where was it? She moves her finger across the different buttons, searching. Where is the power?... Here you are. Good... good... just like training... Undocking... undocking... Yes... red... Ok... Ok... I remember this... undocking... We don't have four minutes to spare. We're going manual... Okay. Arming the system... Firing the pyros... Rezerv rasstyk! I engaged manual control- R O A K and RYD are activated. Oh, no. No, no, no. Great. Fantastic. Perfect. Clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris. SHE HUMS A SONG, the tune is reminiscent of the Hank Williams Melody that Matt had played earlier. Okay. We detach this and we go home. Piece of cake. Oh shit. Shit! No... no... no.. I hate space. SOYUZ SPACECRAFT. CONTROL CABIN. Shut up! Ok. Alright. That's good. Okay, let's stabilise you. Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station. Houston in the blind, Tiangong is approximately 100km... to the west and I am off it's course by about 3 degrees. I will correct trajectory. Ok. She releases the safety lock and places her finger on the button. Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five... four... three two... one... One... One... one... Come on. Come on! You gotta be kidding me. Where's your backup? Where's your goddamn backup?! FU-- This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston. Houston! This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. Do you copy!  Houston, you're coming in over the AM frequency. Please confirm identity. Is this the Chinese Station? Is this Tiangong? Copy? Do you speak English? S.O.S. Do you understand? Mayday! Can you copy? Mayday! Mayday! Yes! Mayday! Mayday! Aningang?  Aningang...?  Is that your name? Aningang is your name?! No, Mayday's not my name. I'm Stone, Dr. Ryan Stone-- I need help.  Dogs...  Are those dogs? Those are dogs! Are you calling from Earth?! Where are you, Aningang? Is the sun out? Are there birds? Are there trees? Can you smell the ocean? Is it beautiful where you are? Here it's colder than hell and lonelier than shit, but it's beautiful Aningang. Utterly, terrifyingly beautiful. Make your dogs bark again, Aningang. Will you? Please... Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof. Woof. Woof. I mean, we're all going to die. Everyone knows that. But I'm going to die today... Funny that. To know. And you know what Aningang... I don't care. I don't care if I die. I don't have anything... not anymore. But the thing is... I'm still scared. I'm really scared... No one will mourn me. No one will pray for my soul. Will you mourn me, Aningang? Is it too late to say a prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I have never prayed in my life... no one ever taught me how... No one ever taught me how... A baby. There's a baby with you. You are singing to your baby? Is that a lullaby? That's so sweet! I used to sing to my baby too. I hope I see her soon.  That's nice. Keep singing, Aningang, just like that. Sing me to sleep. I'll sleep and sleep and sleep. Sing to me, Aningang... sing...sing.... No... no.. don't. How did you? How? You never told me where. No. We can't. I tried everything. They're for landing so. I never got to land the simulator, I told you. And I crashed it every time. How did you get here? What? Landing, landing. Landing is launching. Okay, landing, landing, landing is green. Okay, okay landing, alright. Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing. ... you're a clever son of a bitch Matt. So to land I need to get rid of the BO and Engine module, okay? Listen to me Matt. You're going to see a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah, her hair is probably a mess. That's okay, she doesn't like to brush it. Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She was so upset about that shoe Matt, but tell her it was right under the bed. Tri module separation, go... Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth. Let's reset you then. Okay. I only have one shot at this. One shot... What's the point if we don't try? Wow... you were right Matt... it's magnificent.... You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. But not before I get to you. You have my last ride home. Okay, I'm done with just driving. Let's get go home. Ahhhhhh! Come on. Come on. Seriously? In the Soyuz the power button is erm....here! Ah, ok ah undocking, undocking....eenie, meenie,... Ok. That doesn't sound good.... Miini... moh... No hablo chino. Mini... moh... Okay....okay... Good...good...There. And this should be... Okay... Houston in the blind... This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the Shenzhou. I'm about to undock from the Tiangong and I have a bad feeling about this mission. Reminds me of a story, Houston-- Okay, you know what, Houston? Never mind the story... It's getting hotter in here. The way I figure it, there's only two POSSIBLE OUTCOMES-- I either make it down in one piece and I'll have one hell of a story to tell... ...Or I burn up in the next ten minutes. Whichever way it goes, no harm no foul. Because either way-- It'll be one hell of a ride. I'm ready. Yeehaaa! Ahhhhhhhh! AAAHHHHHH! Thank you. Ahhhhh!!!"
ghostbusters,RAY ,Dan Aykroyd," And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.  Egon!  The phone! It sure feels strange not having Egon with us. Did it have any distinguishing marks? No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here. Then explain those!  What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!  I dunno... that is strange. Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.  Shh!  It's in there.  It's in here -- I can feel it.  Something's close.  Very close. It is a werechicken! Bad choice of words, Winston. Trap out! We've almost got him!  Well, that takes care of one werechicken. Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's wife. Peter!  Wait! Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken! It's the moon! Tonight's the first -- -- lunar eclipse in ten years!  Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full.  Egon?  Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens!  ""The werechicken appears during the full moon.  Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken.""  That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...  According to this, there is an antidote. But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes!  ""One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin...""  ""And one tablespoon of chickenbane."" Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon!  Quick, Egon, drink this! The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane. The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still out there somewhere. Not a peep.  Let's split up. We didn't!  Come on!  On our way, Peter. Check!  We're almost there. Let's reel him in!  Whose job was it? It's gonna blow!  Peter, that's not a bed idea!  Chicken freezes at very low temperatures! It looks like it's about to lay an -- It came from the lab!"
heathers,VERONICA ,Winona Ryder," Heather told me she teaches people Real Life. She said Real Life sucks Losers dry. If you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly. I said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly. She said Yes. I said You're Beautiful. What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my... Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...  Hello, Heather. Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock. I'll think about it.  Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent. Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question? Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last...... Betty Finn. Gosh..... I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month. Don't say that. I was talking with someone! Wake up. In two days, Earth's going up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City. You're beautiful.  I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people? Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna? Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims. What about you Rodney? If you're going to openly be a bitch.... Damn.. ..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers are the same. Didn't you see The Breakfast Club? Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness. I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?  We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest. A true friend's work is never done. Maybe you should see a doctor. Geez, don't listen to them. Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed. Give me the clipboard. Hello Jason Dean. No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may seem like a stupid question.... If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do? How very. Later. No way. He used blanks. All J.D. really did was ruin two pairs of pants...Maybe not even that...  Can you bleach out urine stains? Never say never. Give it up girl!  Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant? All right. I don't know, it was okay, I guess. I guess. Maybe. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.  Because you're an idiot. Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight. No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well. Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe. I didn't. Cherry. Great bike. I don't know. Should you? Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.  Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University. It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends. It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit. Dear Diary, I want to kill and you have to believe.....damn pen! You have to believe it's for more than selfish reasons. More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle. You have to believe me.  No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one. Gee, thanks. Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything. Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs? Seventeen is the last year Mom buys the Twinkies. When you make the jump from working weekends at Pizza Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you lose something. Not innocence--power. J.F.K.! Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm allowed an understanding that my parents and these Remington University assholes have chosen to ignore. I understand I must stop Heather. Hey really, I don't feel so great. I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice.... You don't deserve my fucking speech! Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please? Betty Finn was a true friend and I sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd be like offing the Wicked Witch of the West. Or is it East? West! I sound like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing her aerobicized ass but tonight let me dream of a world without Heather. A world where I am free. You goddamn bitch! Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.  S'okay.... Sure. But I'm Blue. I've always treated Heather's teen queen power plays as bullshit..... But I'm really scared. Who am I going to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound like an Afterschool Special. You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set. What a night. What a life. I almost moved into high school out of sixth grade because I was some genius. We all decided to chuck the idea because I'd have trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah. Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius. Killing her won't solve anything. Well then, I'll pray for rain. Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky. There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm. I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die. But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.  Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover. What about orange juice and milk? What's the upchuck factor on that? Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her. O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon? What are you doing? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that. Just give me a cup, jerk. Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something. No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely. You're not funny. Bonehead. Morning, Heather. We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night. No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend. Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna... Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford. It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano. Like a suicide thing?  I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own. ""You might think what I've done is shocking..."" That's good, but Heather would never use the word ""myriad."" She missed ""myriad"" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right? You're probably right...""People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."" That's good. Have you done this before? Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness. She realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death. Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food. Uh-huh. You're an asshole! Mute him! Next channel, darling. Heather, how many networks did you run to! Oh, I have to hear this.  What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at? Yeah. Scary stuff. Hello.  My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.  Right. All right. I don't know, it was okay, I guess. Maybe.  Because you're an idiot. Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow. Hi. I'm sorry. Technically I didn't kill Heather Chandler but hey, who am I trying to kid, right? I just want my high school to be a nice place. Amen. Did that sound bitchy? Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why? Heather, I've got something going with J.D. All right, but I hope it isn't going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows. Yeah, right, asshole. I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off. So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus! Hi Guys. I came to check on this week's lunchtime poll topic. Oh. Sure. The what? I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'm sorry? I don't get it. Yeah. And? I left him drunk and flailing in cowshit. Don't shut up. I'd like to know just what I did.  Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-bitch. Thanks Pete, for the Famine Fund. Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I didn't expect to be calling either. I guess my emotions took over. I was wondering if you wanted all those things you've been saying to really happen. It's always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once...... Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum. That's right, tonight. In the woods behind the school. Don't forget Ram. I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks. You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over. French. So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding. First tell me this similarity is not incredible. Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole. We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play. Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K. Oh. You must have had fun. Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.  Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?  Hi Guys. Glad you could make it. I've made a circle on each end of the clearing. Ram, you come over here. When you get in the circle, strip. I was hoping you'd rip my clothes off me, sport. Count of three, guys. One. Two. Shucks.  Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on.... Kurt doesn't look too good. We killed them, didn't we? Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot! I did not want them dead. Did not. Did not.  Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral? Your son's dead and you love him.  Superb. That's three things. No, it's okay J.D., I just kind of wanted to talk.....Oh, a newsmagazine show on Channel 16. Really? On the suicides. No, sounds great. Bye. Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count. The most popular people in the school are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing but what really frightens me is that I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do next. It's God versus my boyfriend and God's losing.... Can't you see this is a special moment? Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.? You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience. Don't even talk about that stuff! You can be so immature!  Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home. Do you like your father? Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for... Maybe. We're breaking up. I am out! You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you. I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....  Something like that. Will you do it? I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you? Things are going to change, Earl. Heather. Ouch. Your machine's got the most obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry. I'm just calling to say you can wear your hair any way you want to. Is this David? Heather's David? What are you doing.... I'm delirious for the both of you. Can you put Heather on? Hello, Betty..... Don't get cocky, girl. That's bullshit. Just shoot.  Shoot. Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked. It's not my style, okay? Sure. See ya. So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight? You're so polluted. Talking down to people, making fake notes.... No, you're wrong. It's not even your turn. Ich Luge bullets. I'm such a jerk. I was waiting for my friend Betty. Shucks, that's a great idea, Pete. But my name's not... I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering. The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness. It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up. But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right. Oh yeah. Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep. This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life. Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern. All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized. I guess I picked the wrong time to be a human being.  Is she dead? I said I was sorry. You're not funny. Ouch! Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on. Heather told everyone about Heather. Yes, Dear Diary, I've cut off Heather Chandler's head and Heather Duke's head has sprouted in its place like some mythological thing my eighth grade boyfriend would know about. Heather's even doing the old note trick. I did it J.D.'s way. I did it Pauline's way. Nothing's changed. I guess that's Heather's way. And jesus, what about J.D.? I can't get him out of my head. Are we going to the Prom? Or to Hell? And where's Heather going? What were you trying to do? Sleep? You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of. If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you? Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host. Sure. Heather? People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton... Don't talk to me like that.  No. Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?  I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide. It's over, J.D.  Over! Yes? Oh my God.... Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know! Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side.... You're still not listening! I'm not..  This knife is filthy. I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless. Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note. No-o! Heather? Wha... What are you doing here?! Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A. That is to say, no one but me. I know where J.D. is coming from and where he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going to teach him what's right. I'm going to stop J.D....If it's the last thing I do. Hey Mom, why so tense? Where is he? Where's J.D.? Get a job. Rodney, where's everybody going? Oh my God, the damn pep assembly.... Rodney, what's underneath the gym? May I see your hall pass? Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground. Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head. The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do you turn it off? Tell me! It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it. How do you turn the fucker off? The bomb, asshole! You know what I want, babe? Cool guys like you out of my life. But babe, don't worry, these here were Ich Luge bullets.  I thought I...you.. Perfecto. Yeah, I just got back. Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town. Hey, Martha, wait up. My date for the prom kind of flaked out on me, so I thought if you weren't doing anything that night we could go to the video store and rent some new releases or something. Maybe pop some popcorn. So would I."
mobsters,LUCIANO ,Andy Romano," Frankie. Didn't I tell ya about makin' nice ta the customers? You fellas got names? Tell ya what. In consideration of this little misunderstanding, we're gonna give you fellas protection for free.  I wanted it, so I took it.  So long, Mama. You ain't always gonna be poor. Rothstein put me on to this place. Meyer just finished the books. Charlie Luciano. Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do. Tell me about it. Poor, yeah. Don Maranzano. Welcome. Good liquor draws a good crowd. Not a lot ta know. Don, I'd be honored. My fuckin' meat packin' plant. Shuddup. Spare us. I can just imagine. For being a bootlegger? The name's Charlie. Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started. I've got friends. An' Masseria's got seven hundred.  He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him. Thanks for lunch. Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition? What about the share. I got partners. And the Jews? Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war. There won't be any way to stay out of it. So what is the problem? That I got a smart Jew partner. I'm gonna thank the Don for the invite, then we're gettin' the hell out of here! I sent him a case of Scotoch. Where's Masseria? If ever I need a Boss, Joe. Whatta ya mean, Boss? Come on. Be polite. Jesus. We already met. You here with Bobby? It's been a while. I didn't figure to see you again. In fact, I wasn't sure I ever saw you at all. There are warmer places. What's the matter? Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast. For what? I turned him down flat. Masseria's been after me too. We were overdue to get hit. We can operate around these guys. Okay. I'm listening. This is your territory, Nucky. How'd you like ta make a lotta dough for doin' nothin'? Rothstein gets an exclusive to land booze on the Jersey shore. We get protection for our trucks up to the Camden ferry. You get ten percent from each end. Forget it. SHIT! I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight. Wrap it. Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems. You wouldn't live out the week. Masseria's scared. He might make our deal. Which is why he doesn't need us. At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply. It's past that. We take over the whole show, or we're all dead. If it comes to that. Yeah. Luciano. Something came up. Same here. Yeah. Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this? You got something to hide? Have you thought about this? Guess I'm too confused to think. What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet. You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy. I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside. Never threaten me, Boss. But yeah, I'll join up. Under the right conditions. I'm number two. Above everybody but you, including Catania here. We get a fair piece of all the action, and everything from me and my associates goes into the pot. Everything, that is, except not one fuckin' drop of whiskey. That stays with me and my friends. I guess we got a deal. I'll be spending most of my time helpin' the Boss with the day to day. Frank Costello will be in charge of all the gambling, and my good friend Sonny Catania will oversee burglary and the other strong-arm operations. We will maintain a special relationship with Tommy Reina and his boys in the Bronx. Treat them as your brothers. We will maintain a respectful relationship with the Profaci family in Staten Island and with Maranzano's outfit in Brooklyn. They don't fuck with us, we don't fuck with them. I got a liquor business with them, and they've also got the toughest enforcement operation in town, so I expect you will treat them very respectfully. And you're pokin' this sister so sweet, she's gonna help you nab the payroll? I looked at the job last year. That geezer ain't workin' alone. Traffic's crazy at that hour. How you gonna get out of there? Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate. If there's a war, we're not gonna win it our troops in the slammer. Come on, what's the problem? Meyer. Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble? Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on. Whatta ya mean? It's great! I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales. Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money. Like a party for all our friends. Like Don Maranzano. I'll handle the Boss. How soon can we pull this off? Your honeymoon, Meyer? Ya never tell a guy about a broad. Gives us something in common. He's trying to make it. He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss. You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano. So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play. You're so big, you don't even have to come to the meet. You have your number two run it for you. Don't I make the Boss look good? Mr. and Mrs. Charles Luther. You've got the public upset, Al. When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen. We're asking you to go to prison. If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge. Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads. Al, you owe me one. Civilian gets blown away, cops come to me for answers. There's rules. And number one is no contract jobs in my territory. Where we headed? Boss, I got all the time you need. That little party's gonna make you a lotta money. Didn't know you felt that way. You gotta plan these things. Bastard didn't even show. Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf. After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer. I'll do fine. Yeah. But he needs me alive. Who first? And when? Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school. That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough. And what do you want out of this? I found that out. That's why I'm here. I'll take care of the Boss. I don't fuck my partners. You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy! No. London? What the hell is wrong with you! If I look weak now, it's over. Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me. Where's the morphine! I told you twenty! You bastards, I said twenty! I NEED THE TWENTY! Fuck you all. Not you!  Guess I'm just lucky. You got men on Profaci's place? The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us. Who? Don't touch Tommy until Masseria goes after Profaci. Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is. Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer. Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job. Bye, Frank. A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it. I meant just what I said. It always is. Ain't nuttin' looks worse than a stiff laid up in the street. Sonny, you better hope you Boss needs you more than he wants me dead. If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason. So tell me when I ain't done it. You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes. Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way. Trust me. They do what I tell 'em. You and me both. Sal-va-to-re. Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy. The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself. What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap? Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews. Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory. I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses. Forget it. That's past. Our enemies have infiltrated our family. Do you think it was an accident you almost died? We have to take action. Now. Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die. They're friends of our enemy. Not if they all die at once. I call a meet. Everybody in town but you and Maranzano. A peace conference to find an end to the war. They know me. They trust me. Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation. We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us. Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama. Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks. When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be. Not stupid. Fat. Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob. Couple hands. No harm in it. An ignorant, old, fat man. But I'll get ya next hand, after I take a leak. One move pardner, and you're a dead man. So? I'll get Bugs ta do it. Operator. I need the police. That's a lie! You fellas want the true facts? I wasn't washin' my hands. I was takin' a piss! Who hired the bastard? There's a way. We just ain't thinkin' hard enough.  I'm doin' business here! Here. That hold a while? I'm gettin' more like my old man every year. It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good. Your friends in London still have that house in the country? If you wanted to get married, maybe we could honeymoon there. Is it okay if I go back to work? Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster? It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink. Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again. Herman Coll, please. Herman Coll, please. Herman Coll, please. What about a .45? Just goes ta show, Mad Dog. Don't believe everything ya read in the newspapers. Even scum like you ain't supposed ta hit a guy at home. Where the people he cares about find refuge from this fucked up world. But then you always said the rules didn't apply ta Mad Dog Coll. That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately. Maybe you better hear what I got to say first. No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another. As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war. We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me. I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, ""Charlie, we still want you to run things for us"", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no. You wanna be Boss, Joe? And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome. Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals? Maybe that's why I'm the Boss."

Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev    , it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle. Sorry, Ev, to bother you again. This is for Joey, his reward... for this wallet he found.  When I, uh , returned it I told the guy he hadda give my kid something for finding it, for the honesty.  So the kid would learn how honestly pays. Just give it to him, okay, Ev? ""Into it""!  ""Into it"", for Chrissake!  I was practically living in the goddamn thing... every time I turned around, some other person wants me to save 'em.  Couldn't see a fucking foot in front of me, smoke... then booooom!  It explodes!  I could be dead! Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.

""Keep a low profile,"" that's my motto.  Besides, I got these legal problems. My attorney don't want me giving statements to the press. Bill, I... I... Bill, I got some legal problems and I... Bill, listen... Bill, I got financial problems and... You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here? You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...? Excuse me here, Chick, I gotta do these guys a little favor.  What ""plane crash guy""?  HEY!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?  WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE? Hey, this is bullshit!  Do you guys know who I am?

""Angel!""  I didn't say ""angel,"" that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks. Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect. Your honor, my attorney here says the prosecutor there wants twenty-five grand bail...  --which is fine by me.  I got no problem with that at all. In fact, your honor, I'd be proud to double it.  Fifty grand!  A tip for ""the people,"" your honor, if I could just... The guy's a fake, for Chrissake! He's a goddamn homeless bum.  He ain't no here, trust me on this, buddy. We're all heroes, huh?  Asshole! Me? Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?  You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?  That fake inspired you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job twenty-five hundred goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna do time!  You're s'posed to be an attorney for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have good judgment! Well, you're right, I'm glad you got me out, I appreciate that. Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare? Hey, you could call me ""Bernie,"" forget the ""Mister LaPlante"" stuff. (seeing Donna open her wallet) You are naive. TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!

What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife? Yeah, like that.  Same thing. I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya? Nothin'. The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.  A lot. Look, I'm going away, I just wanna say goodbye to... never mind where. I just wanna say...

(he struggles, then... decisive) Well, you know Joey, this kinda stuff, we gotta talk about it some time, man to man.  But I gotta go off on this -- this damn business trip now...  for a while.  So... so I won't be seein' you.  What you gotta do, you gotta listen to your mother, she's smart, very smart, knows what's best for you and...  No, no, no, it ain't 'cause I don't like you, Christ!  I mean, not ""Christ,"" you know... I mean I don't wanna go on this business thing, I love you Joey, but I gotta! That's part of growing older, all these goddamn (pardon the vulgarity) business things you have to do.  Which reminds me, this ""hero"" business... one of the things you learn as you get older is that life gets very complicated... weird actually... people aren't exactly like they seem...  nothing is...  life gets unbelievable... this is normal as you grow older and...  huh?  I was talking to Joey. Ev, you gotta understand, it's this...  this goddamn business trip, no wait, don't hang up, Ev, just a sec, listen, I just wanna say one thing, okay?  One thing!  I know I kinda act like an asshole sometimes.  I know that.  I know you were a good wife.  I know I fucked it up.  I had a good thing an' I blew it.  I just want you to know I know that, okay?  I gotta go now.  Business trip.  It's gonna be a while. Who the hell are you?  What's goin' on here? You!  Turn that thing off. How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake? (to Chucky, indicating the vidpak) Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just... He's green for Chrissake! You gotta tune it, ya bozo.  You gotta adjust it. Me! The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?  Christ, you media people think you can just buy people.  Cheap. My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault? What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...? ""Harassed.""  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...  Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your... -- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...? Underbelly! I'm going to apologize to Bubber?  Lie, you mean...  I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake. Hold on!  Hold on!  Lemme talk to him for Chrissake! Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy. Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights. Turn that thing off!  You want him to jump? I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care. In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones. What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake! I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks... I was in the can, for Chrissake. Jail!  Listen, Bubber... (looks down, fifteen stories) This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.  I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump. Lighten up, John.  You think you got problems for Chrissake? What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy. Right. Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John. Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions. (indicating the chanting crowd below) Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake! Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards (pardon my vulgarity). I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being around them if you know what I mean.  There you go, you inspire this kid to live.  I probably woulda vomited on him. See what I mean?  You remember his name for Chrissake!  I mean, I remember my own kid's name... but I'm always forgetting his birthday. Plus when they stick cameras in your face and ask all these stupid questions, you smile at them.  You got a kinda...  a kinda... ""gift,"" there, John, if ya know what I mean. People wanna be saved by you.  Even me!  If I was gonna be saved I wouldn't wanna see Bernie LaPlante comin' outta the goddamn smoke an' darkness an' fear an' stuff.  I'd wanna see John God Damn Bubber! You woulda gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it all didja? Bernie.  Call me Bernie. You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...  Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man. You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison. That's good enough for me.  You better take that ""letter"" there and get rid of it. Cause, bottom line, John, I ain't no different than all those dumb assholes down there.  We all trust you for Chrissake!  We... Th-this was really dumb, coming out here. I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes. There was this kid there saying, ""Go in there and save my father, mister."" And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself. So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.  Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John. Hey!  How'd you get in?  Nobody's supposed to come in here! You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people. Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The ""Scumbag,"" right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...  Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day. Lady, do I look dumb enough to run into a burning plane and save a bunch of strangers?  I ain't the type. Oh shit!  Ev!  Joey!  For Chrissake! TV!  Christ Almighty!  You cannot believe one word on TV!  Not one goddamn word! It's all bullshit!  I swear to God! LEAVE MY BOY ALONE, YOU ASSHOLE!  JOEY! You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about ""truth."" Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit (pardon my vulgarity here).  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's your bullshit, so to speak.  You got that? Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, (there's gonna be some vulgarities)..?"
argo,MENDEZ ,Ben Affleck," Yeah. He listens for a moment, then sits up, suddenly wide- awake. Ten weeks State's sitting on this? Compromised? White House? Who else knows? Jesus Christ. Who's handling? They walk through a door and out of the Pit. They don't do exfils. Then why's he want me? You can send in training wheels and wait at the border with Gatorade. Attention turns to Mendez. O'Donnell shifts. Engell, not happy. It's 300 miles to the Turkish crossings. They'd need a support crew behind them with a tire pump. They get caught with journalist creds, you've got Peter Jennings with a noose around his neck in an hour. PAUL LAMONT, late 20s, a Master's from the Woodrow Wilson School before he joined CIA -- The school was shut eight months ago. Bates, meanwhile, removing a binder from his accordion folder: in the binder, a photograph of an emaciated kid in Namibia. What do you see in the picture, sir? A beat. Pender dsn't like this, but he'll play. What's on the ground? So what crops are the do-gooders inspecting under Frosty? Pender shifts. Exfils are like abortions. You don't wanna need one, but when you do, you don't do it yourself. The meeting is breaking up. Pender, followed by Bates, leaves the room. Engell, who has just been made to look bad and inherited a problem, stops by Tony. Buddy-man. You do homework tonight? What was it? But Tony can hear a television soundtrack with ominous electronic music. What do I hear? What channel? Catch me up. Tony listens, staring ahead at the TV . A desert landscape dotted with technological garbage. An ape played by Roddy MacDowell walks across the landscape. He's staring at the television, but now really paying attention. The apes walk into the ruins of what was once a great city. RODDY MacDOWELL  This is the hell my forefathers used to speak about. Hi. Sorry. Hi. They're a Canadian film crew on a location scout for a science fiction movie -- A shift in the room. Star Wars, Star Trek. They need an exotic place to shoot. We put it out -- the Canadian producers put it out -- that they're looking at Turkey, Egypt, whatever. Then we go to the consulate and say we wanna look at Iran. I fly in there and we fly out together as a film crew. Done. This is more plausible than foreigners who want to go to school in Iran -- I've got a contact in L.A. What are you shooting? Any good? Who's the target audience? It's an exfil. Worst place you can think of. Six got away. They're hiding in the city. I'm going over to get them. I need you to help me make a fake movie. I need to set up a production company and build a cover around making a movie. No. That's right. No. Can you teach a guy how to be a director in a day? I'm the producer. ... and past a hundred Komiteh at the airport. That's too soon.  Fade in on starship landing. An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe. Women gather, offering ecstatic libations to the sky gods.' It's a space movie in the Middle East. Ds it matter? Chambers looks at the BULLSEYE logo on the cover page. Reacts. Why do we need the option? Is it the wrong day? One month. Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films. You know Warren Beatty? You got kids, Lester? You see them much? Why's that? A son. Lives with his mother in Virginia. Taking time off.  He's gotta... stay where he is.  War' sounds like Star Wars. Let's use a different word. Mendez closes the door to his private office. I need another week. We've got a script. We've got business cards.We've got a poster. If I'm them? It's nothing we couldn't make at home. Biggest Canadian production in history.' Canadian Gone With The Are you turning people away? Any way to make the chariots look more -- Middle-Eastern -- ? Iran. Kirby takes out a marker and starts to sketch a futuristic-looking desert glider. Tehran. Why'd he do it? It's a death sentence, Jack. How'd you always get around the pricks upstairs? I used your name. Jack looks to Tony. You can forget about that time- share in Ocean City, Jack. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. -- two, we think everybody knows Hollywood people. And everybody thinks they would shoot during Stalingrad with Pol Pot directing if it'd sell tickets. Barely claim me as it is. Just Christine. They don't need to look at one another. A shared understanding. Guess I should have brought some books to read in prison. We've got a green light. Chambers gives Siegel a thumbs-up. Keep the office running till you hear otherwise. (this means thank Business. Film production. The Consul Official looks at his Canadian passport. My boss waited until I was here to send the telex. Can't be right all the time. When'd you get back? Were you metal detecting? But you kept busy. So if they look, they'll know six people didn't come in with me. How's June? I'm sorry. Good. Yeah. Six more are joining me today. They're coming from Canada. The bazaar, maybe the palace. Mr. Ambassador. You're thinking of FBI, sir. They get into the car. I'll take care of that. A day to prep them with their cover stories. Two if they need it. The chances are good. There are no Canadians in the country for normal reasons. That's why I'm here. I'll be with you. This is what I do. This would be a first. Harkins. No. If we go, you need to leave immediately. There's a I don't know. Your cover identities were created specifically for each one of you. Mendez, now dressed to leave, is handing each Houseguest an envelope. What I need you to do is memorize everything inside. Who you are, what you are, where you've been. Cora Lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope. A union card for the Canadian Writers Guild with her picture on it. When we're done, you'll know these so well that you'll dream as these people. Mendez nods at them, and gs. The Houseguests look at what's inside their envelopes -- all except J Stafford, whose envelope remains sealed. The Minister of Culture and Guidance has approved your location scout.'  He will send a representative to meet you and your crew at the Khayyam entrance to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 PM.' Or maybe they're cooperating. Seven Canadians, Jack. They're getting there. What I know is we need to act like a movie crew. We go to the bazaar today, we fly out tomorrow. Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford, sitting with his wife, speaks up -- I'm asking you to trust me. This one, how much? One day, how much? I promise you that if you will play along today, I will get you out tomorrow. My name is Tony Mendez. Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and Kathy. Tell me who you are. This recalls attention from the windows. Let's make a movie. If I said you were looking through the wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right? Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it again. She's the production designer. Her job is to take photographs. SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi. Nobody broke. At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor, holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the Houseguests come inside. Tomorrow they'll be ready. We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to prayer, amplified over a megaphone, in the distance. Where was your passport issued? Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests. Where were you born? Toronno like piranha. Canadians don't pronounce the T. If you're held for questioning, they'll bring in somebody who knows that.  Last three Canadian prime minsters. Good.  Your job on the film. Associate Producer. What's the name of the last film you worked on? Who paid for the movie? What's your middle name? J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls the paper. He's an American spy. Shoot him. A beat on Stafford, frustrated -- They'll try to break you by getting you agitated. You need to know your rsum so well that you don't flinch. My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head. A beat. Mendez puts the rsum back in front of Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't good at this. Let's go again. What is it? I never would have exposed them if I wasn't authorized to take them out. They will be taken. Probably not We're responsible for those people.  I think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest. So you know. Somebody is responsible for things when things happen, Jack. I am responsible. Good. And you two leave right now. Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand. The first checkpoint is just to look at your passport. Your passports came straight from the Canadians, so you're gonna be fine. The second checkpoint -- The second is immigration. You'll hand them these. They say you landed two days ago. These guys are bureaucrats left over from the shah. They can't be bothered to second-guess you. Third checkpoint is the trap. It's manned by Revolutionaries. Most of them were educated in the U.S. or Europe. They know how many T's are in Toronto. You can call our office. Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin Harkins. A 213  phone number. Wha'd you say to her? He wants to fire me himself. If they push it a week, I can bring Ian. That's his winter break. They're gonna hand me an award, then they're gonna take it back? I thought we did. O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. Tony walks towards the entrance and Jack heads to his car. Hi."
quills,COULMIER ,Joaquin Phoenix," Remember your manners. Of course, we mustn't just copy the words; it's important that we know what they mean. St. Augustine tells us that angels and demons walk among us on the earth; that sometimes, they jointly inhabit the soul of a single man... We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption. You'll practice reading tonight on your own? For me? What are we today, Cleante? A bullfinch, or a nightengale? Don't tell me: a loon. Sorry. I've heard that one before -- Madeleine -- The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead. It's not even noon -- It's from our own cellar. I recognize the taste. We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich -- In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters. I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption. Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life. Cheers.  You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more. Please don't eat the paint, Pascal. Bravo, Dauphin. It's far better to paint fires than to set them, isn't it? That's all for today, thank-you. Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton -- Of course. You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.  If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs? A few indiscretions in his youth. I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation. He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value. This is Dr. Royer-Collard; he's joining us here in an... ...advisory capacity. His wife's influence. Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one. A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture. Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises -- He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards -- Oh. That. It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind. For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable. Dear God... You have to believe me, I had no idea -- I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.  Yes?  Shut down?  But he's one among some two hundred wards -- Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward? A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent. On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself -- Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now -- Thank-you, Doctor. I'll effect his contrition; you have my word. The Marquis. He's embarrassed us...  ...before Napoleon himself. He's been slipping manuscripts to his publisher. I place my trust too carelessly, Madeleine. This is a complete... an utter...  ...disappointment. What did you do? Bribe one of the guards? But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction! Enough to discern its tenor. It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like ""nipple"" and ""pikestaff"" -- And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature! But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well? But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast? One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!  More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure. Our future lies in the stroke of your pen. Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves -- You among them?  If ever I showed you a kind hand, Marquis.... If ever I granted you walking privileges on a Spring day, or slipped an extra pillow beneath your door... if ever I shared your wine, laughed at your vulgarities, or humored you with argument... then you will oblige me now. For your sake, and for all Charenton.  Do I have your word? If you only mean to dupe me again --  Thank-you. I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here. He's sworn to obedience. He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend -- I have. I can hardly take credit -- Everyone has talents, if we look for them.  Ah! Curtain time. Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife -- Take him to the infirmary for a plaster, and an ice bath. That'll cool him. Has he hurt you? You mean to take us all down with you? It was fiction, of course. It was not inspired by circumstance. That's not our intent -- I'll do everything in my power -- I hope you're satisfied; he's shut down the theater. How can one man possibly be so selfish? If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice. Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior -- Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur. Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written. You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur. Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them. You always do. I don't know who you insult more; her or me.  That's enough. Good day, Marquis.  You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force. Remember -- anything -- ANYTHING he might fashion as a quill. His entire room, stripped bare.  His rug. Valcour. His chair. Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal -- -- and your meat shall be de-boned. Because your writing continues, unchecked. Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification -- I am sorry, Marquis. Truly. You're lucky it falls to me to punish you. If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive. What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked! What on earth would that require? You expect me to pimp Madeleine? OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES! I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS! NOW STRIP. Your breeches as well. Your wig. Remove your wig. You'll no longer spread your insidious gospel, where art's magnitude is the breadth of its depravity! FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL NOT EVEN WRITE YOUR OWN IGNOMINIOUS NAME! Don't flatter yourself, Marquis. You're not the Anti-Christ. You're nothing but a malcontent who knows how to spell. FREE HER. NOW. It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children -- Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine. Your dagger. Give me your dagger. Not now, or we're both done for. If only blood will appease you, then shed mine. Go ahead. Bind them. Bind them. Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read. But why must you indulge in his pornography? But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence? Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan? This is no place for a child like you. I've good news; I hope you'll agree. I've found employment for you both with the Widow Rougemont in town. You'll have your own cottage on the grounds, and ten francs a month to use as you please. In part, yes. The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court -- Is that a promise you can truly keep? Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here. You shouldn't be calling on me, not at this hour; suppose the nightwatchman saw you, or the cook -- ""Turn you out?"" By whom? The Marquis? Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice. They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn. Don't. Shhh. You mustn't... Go back to your room. Quickly. Don't come back, not tonight, not again -- I love you, Madeleine, as a parishioner -- as a child of God -- My vows are mine and mine alone. So are my failings. Forgive me. Madeleine -- ""...Lead us not into temptation..."" ""...but deliver us from evil..."" Madeleine -- If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself -- Madeleine -- Madeleine -- Madeleine! Madeleine! MADELEINE! As you say, Doctor. I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it. Madeleine. Murderer! Your words drove Bouchon to -- An innocent child is dead. It's no secret that you loved her. I saw the longing in your eye -- -- the passion in your heart -- I know, because I felt it myself -- AND DID YOU? You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged. Why was it you never took her by force? Was it impotence? Then it must've been love --  We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin. Your terrible secret, revealed. You're a man, after all. All that remains now is your punishment. Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.  Our intention here is punitive. If we numb the pain, what's the point? I'm here.  Of course. And my own. Poorly. I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.  No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again. ""In nomine patris et filii et spiritu santu..."" Dear God. Free his mouth. I must grant him his last rites. You'd deny a dying man his salvation? Shhh... shhh...  Dear Heavenly Father. Prove Your infinite mercy, and open Your gates to this man, no less Your child than any other. There is... in each of us... such beauty... and such abomination. No... man... is... exempt. Forgive him. Forgive us all. There now. Kiss the cross. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Listen to me, Abbe, and listen well. I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down. Prove you've an ounce of Christian charity... Bring me parchment... ink... and a quill. Don't you see -- A quill! A quill, goddamn you! A QUILL!"
crank,CHEV ,Jason Statham," JESUS! GET A CELL PHONE!!! hit! Come on ... Let me talk to him. Where is he? Where - thefuck - is - he?  Fine, yes, please let the doctor know that Chev Chelios is a dead man if he can't call me back within the hour... got that?     C HOCOLATE Can you spell that for me sir? D-E-A-D.   Chelios... got it? Thank you. Kaylo. My man. So, where were you last night? I said, where were you last night? GETTING KILLED, YOU IDIOT!  Who would've thought that little bastard had the stones to come whack me in my own crib... it's inconceivable... and yet, here we are. I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen: you put the word out I'm looking for Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call me. I'm going to get that little son of a bitch if it's the last thing I do... it may actually be the last thing I do, understand that? Copy me on that? Find him!  Where's Verona!! Talk!! Don't fuck with me!! DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN MOTHERFUCKER! Look, I got to find Ricky Verona ... ... right, I know, you don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS INTO THAT TOILET!! Where's Verona.  You pulled the Anselmo job together, don't try to bullshit me ... That's not how I heard it. Alright. Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky Verona, that little bitch ... Look, just give me some coke, OK?    You got any coke? Come on, man, I know you got coke. Come on, I don't have time for this, just give me something ... I'm really dying here ... No. You don't understand, I'm really fucking dying ... if I don't ...  May I just have some coke, please? That's right. hat? OK, that's good.    That's good. Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me... What do you know about it?  Of course I pulled the trigger! WHY WOULDN'T I PULL THE TRIGGER?! his shit's not working. Alright ... who wants white meat? Doc? 3A                                                                 23A You motherfucker! 23A                                                                 23A I'm coming for you, asshole, believe me. 23A                                                                 23A Yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you think Carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history.  Great. You haven't been tight since your brother fucked you in 3rd grade. We'll see. 25A                                                                    25A Yeah. 25A                                                                    25A OK, forget it, listen: I'm dying. I've been poisoned with some kind of Chinese synthetic shit. You've got to do something for me, it feels so crazy, like it's in my blood ... It's like... it's like... like I'm slowing down... like I'm caught in a tar pit... Yeah. ure. Not really. Actually I'm feeling pretty good right now. Driving through a mall with five cops chasing me. I'm having a little trouble hearing you, Doc. Explain. What's that? That's what I'm trying to do... just keep moving... keep the blood pumping... every time I slow down it's like my veins start to rust... A couple grams of coke. Yo!   Right here! Go. Straight.    Now. Make a right. ey, crank the music. No, CRANK IT. Pull over.     Come on, right here.    Thank you. OK, I'll be back in one minute.       Don't go anywhere. You move, you die ... AHHHHHHHHHH! Hey boss. Well, something urgent has come up. Then you know what happened? What can I say. Look, Carlito, I need your help. I don't have much time. We've got to find an antidote or something. What's the matter? What, so that's it? A miracle. Well you don't have to be so damn cool about it. Tell me you're going to find that punk Verona and his whole fuckin' crew and feed `em to a cage of wolverines. What is this? Are you boys now or something? Opportunity.  Ill advised? Oh. That's outstanding, Carlito. I'm glad to know that my death can be of some use to you. Am I being difficult? Is this what you call difficult? I don't know if you noticed, but I'm having a DIFFICULT FUCKING DAY, BRO! orget it, I'm out of here. I just gave you 200 dollars to wait for 3 minutes. AL QEADA! he whole restaurant, OLD LADIES included, dogpile the poor CABBIE, wildly protesting in a thick accent. Yeah. Shit. Epi ... something ... OK, OK.        I gotta go. Yeah. 36B                                                                 36B Yeah. Yeah, what is it? Uh huh. Where are you now? I'm there.     Meet me on 3rd and Flower. motioning to the restaurant) He's in there now? Did anyone go in with him? lright, wait here. How you like that one, tough guy? How freaking awesome was that? You feel like talking to me?   Where's your brother? Nice ... wonder how many steaks I could get out of you ... LEX rolls onto his knees, and with a burst of energy throws himself at CHEV. HE SMASHES CHEV INTO THE ALLEY WALL and lands on him with his full weight. WHAT?? Jesus ... nothing's easy ... You want to hold hands?  Hey Ricky, whadya think about sucking me off, ya in the mood? Maybe let me lick your ass or sumtink? That's right, bro. You wanna guess how I got your brother's cell phone? I can tell you have it all figured out. Looks like you should've cut me up when you had the chance. A necklace? You guys really are faggots aren't you? No thanks, but you know I believe I'll hang onto it... looks like you'll have to come find me after all. Fucked up that you killed your own brother. What was that... epi... shit... 10 milligrams... e shakes his head to clear it. Huh?    Oh.    I'm taking off. I'd get out of here if I were you.  I'm looking for something ... starts with `E' ... That's funny. No, I'm talking about some kind of artificial adrenaline ... some shit ... you know ... I have heart problems. Yes!    Yes ... that's it ... you have it? Why? Come on, what is that... What? You've got epinephrine on this cart!    I want that shit! What? Yeah, yeah. SHUT UP!!! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT! Give me that. Not going to tell you again.  Now juice me.

You were sleeping in, that's great, Eve ... super great ... you all rested now? Right, you'll be there, OK. Hey doll. That's right. You into it? Thank you.  You haven't turned on the TV today, right? Didn't think so.    Listen, we've got to get out of here. What? The microwave. You love me, right? Then I need you to do something for me. I need you to put some clothes on and come with me right now. I'll change the clock on the microwave.  Great, great ...  Yes. No! ... thanks ...  Nothing ... burned my hand ... It's nothing... don't worry about it... let's get out of here ... I SAID I'M OK, CAN WE JUST LEAVE??!!  I'm sorry ... look, can we just ...  Shit! I'm parked out back. The thing.     What thing. You trying to burn down the building? Whoa whoa whoa... Is this yours? My car. Actually... I took a cab. You know, I didn't have a lot of time to pick this out ...nan Alright, here it is. I told you I was a video game programmer. That was a lie. Actually... I kill people. I'm a professional hitman. I freelance for a major West Coast crime syndicate. Last night was a job like a hundred others. A high dollar hit. Nothing special. Your life, jackass.  A hundred grand wants you dead, so sooner or later it's going to happen. But I'm not doing it. nstead, you're going to do something for me. You're going to get out of town. Disappear. I don't care where you go, I don't care what you do, so long as you're invisible for 48 hours. That's all I ask. Or if you prefer, we can do it the other way, the way where I go to work and you go meet Buddah. See: I quit. I quit the business. For you. figure I call you that night. I tell you everything. You understand. Yeah, well... I may be going on a trip, but you're not coming with me... Eve... baby... please! You think it sounds crazy? How do you think I feel - I've gotta live this shit... ... just need...  Wait a minute. Do you trust me? Make love to me. Come on. I think it'll help. Take your clothes off. You always say you want to be more spontaneous. VE You're insane. You're like some adrenaline junkie with no soul. Save me, Eve. Save my life.  I'll fucking get it up! Shut up! I'M STILL ALIVE! I'M STILL ALIVE!!! Shit! Yeah. Kaylo? No shit.    Where are you?  Shh.  Downtown? Listen to me. You don't let that motherfucker out of your sight. I'll be there in ten minutes. You got that? Out. I have to go. Please understand. hit!  I'll call you! Right... just step on it, alright?  Nice. What the hell. grimacing) Tastes like ass. What'd you say was in this stuff?  Wow. It's all you, man.    Keep it. Right...  Wait a minute, wait a minute ...  This is fucked.  Hey, what a coincidence, you like this spot too? Yeah I am.     Where's Kaylo?  OK, ding, time's up ... Alright, where is that motherfucker? What the fuck is this? What?  Carlito? Carlito ordered this? Just die. Maybe you're right. That's true ... we all gotta die ... Right ... so ... let's all die ... OW! Nice. Come on! Wait - ... OK, now come on. here's the keys? VE holds out her hand, where she's had them all along.  Cool. Welcome to my life. Oh. Yeah. The poison? Yeah, that's true too. Pretty much. Adrenaline. It's the only thing that slows it down. Yeah. Sorry. What are you doing? WHAT? Oh boy... Oh yeah, that's... that's really working for me... Stay down. That's it that's it that's it... just a little...  What's the matter? They're dead. I told you, baby... I quit. Wait here. Jesus Christ! Now what...?  Stay. I can't feel my leg. ello? Where are you? Sure, why not? gesturing with his head at the IV) What is this stuff? It feels sort of good. So I'm not... better? So... what are you going to do? Then what?  Does she know? A dream. No... no, that's not what I want. One hour. I want one hour. Hey douchebag, thought you might be interested in a little deal. I want the antidote. That's right. How about the jewelry I got off your faggot brother, you cocksucker? Thinking about it? You like that deal? I'll be at Downtown Standard in twenty minutes. You know the spot? Don't be late, or I'll trade this thing to some whore for a hand job ... It's going to be alright, baby. I know. But things have changed. There's an antidote. I can make a deal for it, but I've got to go alone. Of course. But you'll be safe now. And I'll be back. I promise. What's happening, brother?  Did you say something?  Right, with you popping Valium like Tic Tacs and balling some new asshole every two weeks... why wouldn't I stick around for entertainment like that?  Mom, I got no time for this... Orlando?  This is weird. I'm the Terminator. Don't tell me you're talking about your bro, Def Lepard. Yeah, not so much. I don't get it - why didn't you guys just cut me up alive when you had the chance?  Who the hell are you, anyway?  I think I'm starting to figure it out.  Yeah, maybe. But I'm taking you with me.  Some pills, Doc. Easy ... Looks like everyone's here. No shit. Basically.  We'll see what kind of a bitch you are when Carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me... and you take it. You'll probably throw boss a nice little reach-around just to show what a good bitch you are. Is that what I think it is? Not so fast, motherfucker.  Booosh! Presto. Too late! Oh no you don't... Present from Kaylo. I told you I'd kill you, you son of a bitch! Hey doll. Looks like I let you down again. You were right about me ... funny, you really have time to reflect on things when you know you're going to die ... seems like all my life I've just been going, going, going ... I wish I'd taken more time to stop and smell the roses, so to speak, but well, I guess it's too late now... you were the greatest, baby."
soldier,SANDRA ,Connie Nielsen," Want to try some more of this? You rest now.  I'll give you more later. No, but he's covered with old wounds, all sorts of scars.  Knife scars, bullet scars, burns. There are words on his shoulder. Tannhauser Gate, the Argentine Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai 2012... We'll have to sleep on the floor.  I won't permit danger to Nathan.  You must be...you must be feeling better.  He's late learning.  He was sick for a long time. This way... You have to watch out for them. They probably wouldn't kill someone your size, not if you were healthy anyway.  But they'd make you pretty sick.  Someone smaller...like me, or a child... In a month this one will be as big as those. Here.  You try one. ...And it got worse and worse.  My father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence...  political feelings.  My father said he'd heard it was better in the Trinity moons. A lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people...mostly families.  That's probably why it broke down...  overloaded. Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with.  It just...dropped.  Maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind.  A lot of people died.  And we couldn't make any radio contact... So we were stuck here.  Nobody was happy about it.  A few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires.  But it didn't work. They must be unmanned...or they just don't care.  Maybe they think we're garbage too! So there really wasn't any choice. People had to pull together and make the best of it.  We became a... community. One good thing...nobody bothers us. Who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this? I guess that's what you like!  The fighting, I mean.  The wars. (unsure, a question really) You must...you're a soldier... We'll eat these. It seemed like he was never going to walk.  Then all of a sudden...he's an expert.  Well, not quite an expert. Sergeant Todd...what's it like...what's it like being a soldier? What do you think about? Do you think about food?  Or women? You must think about something. What about feelings then?  You must have feelings.  You must feel something.  Fear!  You mean...you feel afraid?  That's when you're in battle... What about other times?  Now, for example?  Now? You don't...look afraid.  You look fearless.  Oh, my God.  But there's nothing to be afraid of here.  I can't hurt you.  I wouldn't. It's beautiful, Jimmy.  He'll love it.  You should give it to him yourself. I think he's in the meeting room... doing...exercises. He's not fully recovered. I know. Are you afraid of him, Mace? He told me he's afraid. What happened?  And if you're ever sick...or you get hurt... Mace!  What about the vote? Everybody voted. What's going on? Keep going, children, don't panic, don't panic. Into the bedroom, all of you. Sergeant Todd! Nathan, thank God, there you... Did he find you? My husband...Mace...he went out to look for you.  He...found you, didn't he? They...killed him...didn't they? Your wound...it's still bleeding. It doesn't...hurt? How do you know they'll come back? What...what do they want? Nothing? You know who they are, don't you? Do you know how many there'll be? Seventeen!  My God!  You can't fight seventeen yourself! You have to organize the rest of us, show us what to do.  We don't have your...your skills...but we're not cowards.  We'll do what you tell us, we'll -- Why not? But...one soldier against seventeen! Sergeant!  Sergeant Todd! Sergeant...these soldiers...the ones you're going to fight...  Are these the ""better ones""...the ones who replaced you? Sergeant Todd...I think they...I think...someone made a serious... mistake.  Sergeant Todd  said... He  knew them!  He said -- He's not dead! ""-- sailed an a river of crystal light into a sea of dew.  Where are you going and what do you wish the old moon asked the three.  'We've come to fish for herring fish...'""  SHHHHHHH! Oh, my God!  It's... it's you! Are you...all right? Go? Sarah, you hang on to Sergeant Todd. No matter what happens! Ellen, go to the Commons.  Tell Jimmy Pig and Mr. Slade that Sergeant Todd says we have to leave as soon as they get everybody out of the root-cellar.  Can you do that? It's all right.  The soldiers are gone for now.  But be careful where you walk.  And if it's too smoky, just come back.  Tell them to bring all the food and clothing they can carry. (turning to the children) Do you all understand that Sergeant Todd here is going to help us, and whatever he says to do you must do immediately, as if he was your father or your mother. No... but he's our friend.  Our good friend.  Do you understand? No.  No, he can't do that, but -- Sergeant Todd! THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN! Sergeant... Nathan!"
prometheus,WATTS ,Noomi Rapace," Moving to survey site B... closing on object four. The large oblong. There you are. Martin. Here. You need to see this. Same thing again. An ephemeris - a star map.  Radius, inclination, azimuth...more data here... Can we raise this thing? Me too. Checked it twice. What do we do now? What's first? You do climate, I do genetics? You think he's serious? Weyland can send his shuttle out for pizza. Martin. If this meeting goes like the others, maybe we should... How do you know? Hello, DAVID. They say you're getting diminishing returns. It's not working. Doctor Watts. I was analyzing historical changes in human DNA. I found the same pattern. Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new information in the genome of the human race. All over the world. Evolution can't do that. Something was changing us. Changing the DNA of our species. Once you know what you're looking for, it's amazing how the evidence falls into place. The writing is a formula giving the location of a single star in our sky. You're bluffing. He made the Heaven and the Earth. And that change coincides with a visit by the Engineers. They didn't just change us. They changed our world. I'm out of sorts. Sorry. My head's buzzing. Like you've done this before. Yes, thanks... By an unmanned probe. Very crude. No. Confirmation of Professor Holloway's theories would change everything. There'd be science before Holloway and science after. DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you. All's well, I think. You studied our work for two and a half years. Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's only ten of those things on Earth! I guess nine, now. But when you get back... They don't know? They volunteered. We probably won't meet anyone. You'd expect a star-traveling race to generate radio or laser signals. Fusion drives and gravity drives have clear signatures. But Zeta Two Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers have gone missing on Earth. By the pattern, they should've come to Earth seventeen centuries ago. And again six centuries ago. But no sign. After twelve thousand years...they stopped coming. First humans in the system. Why look like a man at all? Why not be a box on wheels? You see yourself as a superman. What if they're really there?  The Engineers. They could be there. Waiting for us. What then? Tungsten, tantalum, aluminum. That could be technology. Identical, apart from weathering. I don't think anybody's been home for a long time. We've got that outside the windows and you want to wait `til tomorrow? The air here will kill you, so keep an eye on your supply and watch your seals. Pathogen tests are clean. The door's open. Martin. Martin! Jack it open? Or cut through? Martin. This air's breathable. Intense field readings. Huge power sources here. How does this work? Look. Do you see, the size of them? Like that ghost we saw... They switched to channel three. I hear them talking. They're okay. Martin. Martin. They were killed. All of them. Communications are going to hell. Help me unload! You don't want to know. Martin. Look. They look like us. Formaldehyde! How could anyone know... Twenty-four pyramids scattered around the moon's equator. Massive power supplies. Vents in the walls. Atmosphere changes. Breeder tanks...  The pyramids are terraforming machines. It didn't fail. It was wiped out. Neural paths are still conductive. Formaldehyde's killing the tissue. Of course. The lens is where the phase shift happens. Glasse. I want to look through these lenses. Can you seal them and do the optical correction? We found the gods. And they've been murdered. What could kill them? Martin, stop! What is that? Where'd you come from? What are the guns for? You should have talked to us. Martin's mission leader. That's in our contract. What are they doing in there?! We found the tomb of the gods, and brought grave-robbers right to the door. Something different killed these. Martin? Martin!  Please, anyone...I need help. Martin's missing. We can't leave Martin out there.  She says ""her forces are committed."" Thank you. I can't think about this now! I'm human.  No. Janek, hang on... We've got him!  Martin! Where's your helmet? Let's get you home. What happened to you? What's this? What did you see? Are you okay? You sound... Martin. All right. We will. You all right? Your heart's beating so hard. Martin! Martin! Martin! Martin. Martin! I want to understand. We found Engineers who died like Martin. Explosive wounds in the chest. Whatever killed Martin is the same thing that killed the Engineers a thousand years ago. But not all the Engineers died that way. The others were torn apart. Slashed to pieces. DAVID. How did you do that? Their homeworld. Do you see where the Engineers come from? DAVID. The creature that killed Martin. There are thousands of them under the pyramid. Hatcheries.  Those things wiped out the Engineers on this moon.  You're turning things on? This site should be sealed. Evacuated. It's too dangerous. If your owner gives you a direct order, you have to obey. Don't you? I can have Vickers pull you out. What's protocol two? DAVID. What are you doing? Stop! DAVID. No. No. Why would they make such things?  Come on...I need a Caesarean.  Not yet...not yet... I was. No. I brought it in.  I took it out. Protocol two. DAVID exposed me to a parasite. He just watched it take me. I threatened to make him leave. There's a ship under the pyramid. DAVID calls it the Juggernaut. He's inside it. Re-activating it.  The things that infected Martin and me. The Engineers made them to kill humans. There are thousands of them on the ship. They were taking them to Earth. That's what the Juggernaut is for. To exterminate us. Even if we could, we can't leave DAVID on that ship. We have to stop him. DAVID. You're DAVID's owner. He has to obey you, right? But if you went to him, turned on your suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear you. He'd have to obey. So we go. Armed to the teeth and fast as we can. Where are Chance and Ravel? You called your soldiers in and left them out there?  I think you should stay aboard. Keep working. If we fail, you're our only shot at getting home. Glasse. You finish that project? God's-eye-view. All this time. DAVID saw. If DAVID comes at us, shoot. You won't believe how fast he is. This way. Stop. Who's missing? I know. The Juggernaut? Where will he go? DAVID. Where will he go? We have to stop the Engineer. Pilot's seat. This way. No! The Juggernaut's lifting. There's a living Engineer on board. He's taking the ship to Earth. Dead. All dead. Janek. We have to stop that ship. We have to do something. That ship is genocide if it gets to Earth... What about you? Yes.  I am! Janek. Look.  DAVID. I'm not going to fix you, DAVID. I don't need you. I'll hold out. A ship will come."

whiteout,CARRIE ,Kate Beckinsale," Alright --  Hey Fred, unlock any secrets of the Universe -- discover we're Alien life forms? Which one's Sapperstein? Okay, thanks. Sapperstein? Wanted to see me? All what? Professor Sapperstein, I'd like you to read something for me. What's this say? C'mon, go ahead, read it. Keep reading. Very good.  Now are you still sure you want to report the theft of an illegal narcotic? Professor...are you planning on doing the winter-over? Good. And how are you feeling right now?  No, no, not crazy. But this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we? How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home? What do you think?  I know you weren't in the area. What's up? What flavor? And we were doing so well.  Where? McClain Valley? What was he doing out there? That's no man's land. No -- just the picture. Bottom of the frickin' planet. Doc? Keller. You seen Doc? Checking the freezer for a popsicle. It got called in this morning. Delfy, one of the pilots here. Yeah -- probably. ...Were you the second guy from the front? Not interested. Fine. I need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle. Yeah, good. I wish -- We got a job. I need you to take a ride with me. So it is. My gut and I don't talk anymore. I saw your boxes packed up. What was all that BS last month about, ""I'm never going back -- I'll die here. Scatter my ashes over the pole""? Not you. Or mentioned her. A grandchild? Doc, that's great. You Delfy? Delfy's taking us, Doc. He's the one who saw the body. C'mon, you'll be fine. I'll even hold your hand if you want. What were you doing out there? That your son? He's cute.   Has your eyes. So why aren't you with him? Hate it. We all make stupid mistakes. Yeah. Got it.      It's a popsicle alright. Red jacket.   He's American. Linger. So do you. Think his name's Weiss. We Wintered-over last year with him. Played cards a couple of times. Yeah.    Geologist, I think. Then where's his crampons -- his gear? Yeah, maybe -- What's the closest camp?  What the hell where you doing all the way out here? You going to be alright? Oh yeah -- I'm really going to miss this place. Who manages the Post Stations? One - two - three... How long to thaw him out? It bothers me no one's reported him missing yet. How'd he get out there?    There were no tracks. Nobody wants to get out of here more than I do, trust me, but right now -- we're all this guy has. Grab that side. ...I'll be alright. I know. Exactly, this is the first murder in Antarctica, Doc -- and I can't just pretend it didn't happen.  I'm sorry. I'm on my way to find out. I'm sure his family's thinking the same thing. I hate interrupting educational programming, but -- I need to talk to Dinkle. Chaplain. What are they doing out there? English, please. I don't get it -- Weiss was no where near Delta One One. When are they scheduled for evac? Isn't that a little unusual this close to Winter-over? -- You've been a little busy. Yeah, I can see that. What's their frequency?  Delta One One, this is United States Marshall Carrie Stetko, come back, over. Delta One One, I repeat, this is United States Marshal Stetko, come in, over. Stetko. Vostok?  Patch it through. This is Marshal Stetko, who's this? Mooney? What happened out there, Mooney? Where's Rubin? Getting drunk already? Murphy's contacting the Feds. I'll do everything I can to get you off this ice, promise. Going to Vostok. One of the guys from Weiss' team called.   Wants to talk. I need a plane to Vostok. I'm not asking. Tell them I took their plane. The Russians barely supply Vostok anymore. They have to barter with other bases for supplies. Some of these guys have been rotting here for years. Who's in charge? Stetko, US Marshal. I'm here to talk to an American named Mooney. I figured. Where is he? Against the law -- Antarctica's the only place in the world you can't have one. Part of the Treaty. All this crap on -- I prefer naked. Do you have to do that in front of me? Sure. Nope. Thoughts?  Mooney? Hello? Mooney? ...My God. Jack? Jack! What happened? Yeah. Someone got to him before I did. Then went after me.  How long was I out? Thanks. I need to get back in there. Let it go, Delfy. Unless you want your head cracked, I wouldn't move. -- Let me see your hands. Now turn around. Who are you? Delfy comes up behind her. Let's see it -- slowly. How do you know about Weiss? This is part of a crime scene. I'll be sure to let the U.N. know if I find out anything. Maybe. Don't take this personally, but I don't need your help. You don't dig for meteorites. Fine. But this is my investigation, understand? If you obstruct it in any way, I will have you detained. No, but I have the feeling you're going to anyway. Murphy, listen to me, it's got to be Rubin who tried to kill me. You have to shut down flights leaving ASB and McMurdo -- search for him. Sam, I think these guys found something out there at the camp. I'm going to check it out. Until I find Rubin, no one leaves the ice. Not yet. Guess so. What time is it? A.M. or P.M.? Wonderful.  I'll take this one. Rubin? Someone's left leg took a hit, lost a lot of blood. What do you got? Looks like they were surveying sections at a time. Yeah -- Looks like they hit some really big meteors. About four miles. I want to check something out first. North. Yeah, a little. Almost two years.  The excitement, mostly. Some shrink tell you that? And do you? Where do you plant your boots? I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six weeks before Winter-over. I met someone, decided to stay. No -- just gave me a headache. This is it. Stop. Just stop. Section 104.   These are the coordinates. This is shaved ice. They were digging, Pryce. And they tries to spread the ice to hide it. Grab me! I'm slipping! I'm losing my grip. ...I'm okay. Cargo plane, but I don't recognize it. Guess that makes three. Where's Pryce? What is that?  Find what you're looking for? And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important. Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. There's blood all over the tunnel. What is that? Go! No signal, you? Someone followed us. How long do you figure we've got? What about the Vodka -- we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice? What choice do we have? What're you doing? We came in through it. Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us. Don't move. Our friend here isn't who he says he is. Didn't you know it's a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here? Stop lying to me -- Delfy, cuff him to the wall. He was saving his own.   Do it. You know what was in that safe.  Now, who are you? I swear I'll leave you here to die. Have you got an ID for that too? Why did you lie to me? Plane could've gone anywhere. There's forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over. Rubin could just disappear in the mayhem. Rhonda? Heading back. How many fly-ins to McMurdo in the last four hours?  -- How many? I need a list of names. He knows I'm on his ass, so he might. Anything's possible. I want to eliminate his options. Back at ASB -- I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One. I'll have the Doc take a peek when we're done. Murphy?   What the hell is he doing HERE I'm on 30 if you need me. Rubin's picture is in a file on my desk. You wanted to see me? Buried under 2 tons of ice. You? Sure thing, Chief. It didn't work, Sam, because you couldn't keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here. I was stupid enough to be one of them. Now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second, you would realize that someone's out there with six cannisters, possibly full of Uranium, and he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people. And I'm trying to stop it -- so fuck asking you for shit, Sam. You know what Doc, it's alright. You got my list? You worry too much -- but it's what I like about you. Doc, did you notice if Weiss had a wound on his left leg? Then it's gotta be Rubin.  I don't know. There's no way they're gonna make it. Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula. Oh God. When did I go to Vostok? No.  No way. Don't tell me that. Pretty tough Marshal, huh?  If you came to propose, now's not really a good time. Anything? ...You ever kill anyone? Anyone you ever trusted? I hadn't held a gun in my hand for over two years.  Wasn't supposed to need one down here. You asked what I was running away from...I came down here to forget my partner, Jack. Thought it would be better than any therapy. We were on a stakeout at a Holiday Inn in Miami, waiting for this buy to go down. I was excited, we'd been after this trafficker for a long time. Thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass. Anyway, guy's a no show. One hour went by, then two - - nothing. Four years together. I knew things about him that his wife didn't even know.  But he was my partner and I killed him that night. There's no changing that. Marshall service cleared me -- ruled it self-defense, but I had a real hard time getting over the betrayal -- how little my life meant to a guy I was willing to take a bullet for. Know what the kicker is -- Jack thought I was close to figuring him out. Thought this hotel room was the best place to get rid of me -- make it look like a bust gone bad. Truth is, I had no idea.  God, I was young and stupid, and in way over my head. You asked me why I smell like suntan lotion -- Jack wore Aramis, this cheap after-shave his wife gave him. Some of the guys down here wear it -- suntan lotion is the only thing that keeps me from smelling it. What do ya got there? These beakers where really in over their heads. Think you can you help me with these buttons, first? Who are you? Mooney's dead. And so's Weiss. It's okay, you're safe, just put the knife down. Who's after you? Where are the cannisters? Rubin -- I need you to focus for me. It's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you. You alright? Pryce -- Rubin's here! He's on the run. Level one. White T-shirt. Jeans.  He's heading for the Science Lab. Rubin, wait! Rubin -- I can help you! Door's jammed -- Pryce, it's not Rubin -- Someone's trying to kill him. Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear on. Thirty seconds. Where are the cannisters? Help me drag him over here. Keep him still. Why did you kill those scientists, Keller? Was a four-way split too much for you? Where is the uranium? Let go of me. Where in the plane? The cannisters are on the plane. Throw him in the holding cell. He's with the UN. We have to search that plane now! Sam, do what is right here.    Come on. We'll need some help. Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you up to, Keller? He's buying time. Out of the way! Shit! He won't try.    He's a goddamn pilot. No!    You stay awake! Damn it!  Come on. We're getting him up. Press here.    Hard. Hard or he will die! He's not going to be number four! You're bleeding out. Freezing drops your pulse. We have to slow it down.  You hold on. Sam -- is Doc on the plane yet? Keller got out. He hurt Pryce -- he's bleeding bad. Where's Doc? Tell him to stay put, and I need your help getting Pryce there. We're at the hangar. I've got to stop Keller, he's got the cannisters. Don't let him die. Keller hit him with an ice axe. No. I'll stay with you -- I'm sorry. Thanks. Hey back. Um-hm. Nope. After all this, no way. Keller didn't have it on the plane because he's got it hidden somewhere.  Where would he hide something for six months. Somewhere he could be sure no one would ever look. True -- what the hell was his plan... Need any help?  Just thinking where it all began. Nothing -- I'll be right back.  Someplace no one would ever think to look. And we thought it was nukes the whole time. How did you get wrapped up in thing, Doc? Then Weiss got cold feet. It got ugly, didn't it -- and Keller killed him at Delta One One. Everything went to hell after that, didn't it, Doc. Doc -- stop. There is no granddaughter, is there? This was about greed, plain and simple. Dead is dead, right? What's happened to you? There are four people dead! Four! People we knew. Doc looks at her.   She's not sure if it's registering. Where you going to stuff my body too? Huh? Was I going to be five? I won't go through it again. Don't make me shoot you, please. Doc, your not thinking straight. Doc, please. Hot. But there's a gentle breeze. Fiji's beautiful this time of year. Nah. Freedom's just a sunrise away."
twilight,BELLA ,Kristen Stewart," I'd never given much thought to how I would die.. Have a good.. ... life. You put it on hold. Look. You also called Mexico. Very romantic. I won't change my mind, mom. It's not about Forks, it's about Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other. I cut it since last time I saw you. Good.  That's right. One bathroom. I can do it Yeah... I think I remember..  Are they always like this? No way. The truck is for me? It's perfect! Maybe I can give you a ride to school. Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person. I'm kind of the suffer in silence type. I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all (hurries to him, Just Bella. That's why they kicked me out. Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team Who are they? Who's he? I wasn't planning on it. Jerk.  That'd be great, thank you. So... you eat here every night? I can cook. I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen. A few people... Do you know the Cullen family? No... well, a little. ... Okay. Mom, where's your cell? Dad, I'm heading out. ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight. BELLA Great. WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck. BELLA Dad, I can drive myself to school. You got me new tires. No one's ever done that before. I mean... nothing. An animal? Be careful. And thank you. For the tires. Terrific. I'm... yes. You've been gone. Prophase.  Like I said. Seriously? You're asking me about the weather? No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks. It's complicated. My mother remarried. Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough. No... I -- I just.. Did you get contacts? I'm fine, dad. Calm down. It's okay, Tyler. Dad, it's not his fault- But you didn't. It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way. It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me. You told her?! She's probably freaking. Can I talk to you for a moment?  How did you get over to me so quickly? You were next to your car, across the lot. Yes. You were. I know what I saw. You stopped that van. You pushed it away. I wasn't planning to tell anyone. I just want to know the truth. No. Why did you even bother? ... Yeah, false alarm..  Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica. Hello, Edward. Really? How did you know about that? You haven't answered any of mine. You won't even say hello. And how did you stop that van? No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together. You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret. I know you do. Your fault, for telling her about the accident. He is. Should I know what that means? I'll go if you stop saying that. Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash. What does that even mean? So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth? Okay... how bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?  No. I don't believe that. You're not bad. You can be a jerk, but it's like this... mask. To keep people away. Look, why don't we just - hang out. Like... come to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes.. La Push. Is something wrong with that beach? You could ask him. (off Angela's flustered Guys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me? Definitely not.  To be polite. You know them? You want to go look at tide pools? So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here? I can keep a secret.. Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? So the legend about the Cullens is.. Didn't they just move here? Riiiight. So what was this treaty? Wait... what were they really? They just... ditch? It's a family thing. Port Angeles?.. (a plan forming in her mind) Can I go with you guys?  It looks great. Look, just take my bag. What -- no, how did you find -- No. Bad idea. And you do? Okay, well. Thank you.  I could eat. You're not eating? Like South Beach? So how bout some answers? I didn't ask for the square root of pi. How did you know where I was? Were you following me? So that's a yes?  You said before... That you heard what those guys were thinking.. Can you... read minds? Why, what's wrong with me? What is it? Edward, you don't have to. Edward I think I'm warm enough now. Your hand, it's still freezing cold. He died? How? The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason? So it's getting closer to town. But that's Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon. That's probably not a good You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like... you're from a different time. How old are you? How long have you been seventeen? I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are. ... Vampire No. You won't hurt me. You're different. Where are we going? No! The sunlight will kill you. Slow down. No. I'm not afraid. No! Edward? Where are you? You're... beautiful.. I don't believe that. I don't care. It doesn't matter. I trust you. I trust you, Edward. I'm here. Edward?  Oh... I thought you hated me when we met. I know you can. I'm afraid. Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll disappear. That I'll lose you. Stupid lamb. How long have you been like this? Where'd he find you? Does someone have to be dying to become like you?.. So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people. Show off. Can they all read minds, too? Your house? With your family? But... what if they don't like me? I'm glad I amuse you. What is it? Come to visit your truck? A person did that? It's... wonderful. EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? BELLA No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside. It's so light and open. Bon giorno? Oh, absolutely I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know.. I would never, ever tell anyone. ... Badly?  And you're Jasper, right? Graduation caps? What a nightmare, repeating high school. So you're obsessed with music. But..  No bed? Ever? Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies.. I'd have to say... Debussy. No dancing. No tripping, no falling, no derision. You don't scare me. Don't you dare - In theory. Sorry I'm late. Biology project. Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak. Yeah, me, too. He's just a friend. We're not really going to talk about boys, are we? So spring training's going well? Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me.  Maybe..  Well... he is kind of a history buff. I, uh... have to go. I'll call you later, Mom. How did you get in here? You've been here before? You're a peeping Tom! Perv!  Oh... I'm... oh. Wish I could say the same. I'm so embarrassed. I have a date with Edward Cullen. We're both juniors. I thought you liked the Cullens. Edward doesn't live in town. And it's in the early stage and - whatever, he's outside right now. He wants to meet you. Officially. Be nice, okay? He's... important. No fair, reading Charlie's mind. And since when do vampires like baseball?  Now I get why you need the thunder. That has to be a home run. Yer out? I said, leave me alone! Get out! It's over. I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.  I can't hurt him. No, Dad. I broke up with him. That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home. She'll come home. I'll call her from the road. I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in few hours. I promise. His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him. If any of you get hurt because of me I wish he'd call. They could get hurt. It's not worth it. How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain. So the course James is on now will lead him to... a ballet studio? No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that. Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years. No. Hell, no. I hated the place. Edward. Are you alright? No... we can't.  When will you get here? Mom, I'm so glad you got my - Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every ... Mom? Are you there? Leave my mother out of this. I... don't think so. Where should I meet you?  8th and Palo Verde, please. Everyone makes fun of me. Mom, I suck. She's not here. Edward has nothing to do with this. No! Edward, don't.. It's on fire! My hand! It's burning! Life... is harder.. An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus. RENE (O.S. Edward? Where's - RENE He's asleep. She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward sleeps. What... happened? Mom, you're... texting. That's great mom. Mom, wait. I want to live in Forks. I have Dad.. What do you think? Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? want to talk to him. Apologize. Is James - did you -- I'm alive because of you. But you did. What? No! I want to be with you! don't want You really are trying to kill me.  You're serious. At prom. Edward... why did you save me?  If you'd let the venom spread, I could've been like you by now. I want you. Always. I'm dying anyway. Every minute, I get closer, older Not the way Alice saw it.  I heard her. She saw me like you. Based on what someone decides. And I've decided. I dream about being with you forever. Yes. Yes. For now. No one will surrender tonight. But I won't give in. I know what I want."
legend,JACK ,Tom Cruise," Mmmmmmm. . . . I know someone sweeter. That was very good. . . .just right. Rabbit is much harder than wren. Stop it. . . . ! I can't see! Much more than wisdom dazzles me. Not today. . . . There's something really special I promised to show you. If it pleases you. This is their season. They won't pass here again for a long, long time. . . . If you want to see them, you must do everything I tell you. I'm taking you to a very special place. . . it's sort of sacred. Nobody but me knows where it is, and, well. . . . You'll have to wear a blindfold. I'll always trust you, Lili. . . . Storm's coming. . . . Many places. . . .None fit for a princess. . . . Be patient! It's poisened the brook. No animal will drink here now. Shhh! Just watch! True royalty approaches. . . . The alicorn purifies the water. . . . There's no creature with more power or magic. . . . As long as they roam the earth, evil cannot harm the pure of heart. . . . A little. . . .it's very hard. Unicorns talk only of love and laughter. Dark thoughts are almost impossible for them to express. No! It is forbidden. These are sacred animals. Don't ever say that! You risk your immortal soul. You're lucky it wasn't a nightmare! When I get to heaven, I know just how the angels will sound. I'm afraid you'll break my heart. Only because I amuse you...Like some trained bear! And if I so....no good can come from it. I am only a Green Man, without land or title...no name or wealth to bring you. But it does matter....! If not now....Someday. What about when the time comes for you to marry? That's impossible! What if I say yes...? Will my wish come true? Lili....! Lili....! Lili....! What's happened.... Lili....! God rest your soul.... I know you won't mind if I borrow your things. What....? Who're you? Who's there....? Gump, is it? How d'you know my name? Everything....? Why has this happened? Why is it winter now? Me? How can I do that? No....well.... I took Lili to see the unicorns..... Oh God, she touched him.... We meant no wrong. Nothing.... I wanted to share something special with her. I'm in no mood for dancing. No! I want no part of your nonsense. No...! Please....! Enough! I....won't....go....on...Take my life, if you must.... What I did is unforgiveable.... But, I did it for love! And I'd do it again! I love Lili with all my heart and would sooner die than break a promise! I meant no disrespect.... And if I cannot? Ask away, and pray God my answer pleases you. Bluebells! The flower. Bluebells. To hear then ringing means your life is at an end. A riddle with an answer is like an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine. I'm honoured, Gump....But no more tricks! Pranks....! Is that all you're good for....! I've lost Lili....! Gump! Help me! Use your magic to find her.... set the world right. Is there nothing you can do? But don't you care what's happened? We must find the answer! The fault was mine. I owe her my life. The dark is where we'll stay.... We're cursed. All warmth and light was lost when the stallion died. We must get the alicorn back. Only then will the world return to normal. She says we're to find a champion.... a mortal, bold of heart and pure in spirit. That is the warmth of her soul. Not even death's icy hand can stop it! Course I am! I don't know.... I was underwater.... and when I came up for air, everything was covered with ice. Weapons....? What are they? Lili....? Be some job in getting it open. Thank you.... Such riches.... I feel I must be dreaming.... ....beautiful.... Stop it....! Go away....! I meant no disrespect, but.... ouch! Make her stop, will you, Gump! What does she want from me? What's this....? Something to cook with? That's really something.... Can I try? ....Shield? That's not so bad.... What do you think, Luna? What! H'd you do that? Magic.... Don't do that. All right, all right.... I promise. I'm ready as I'll ever be.... Where's the unicorn? Princess Lili? She's alive! Legend says the Dark Castle stood in olden days when evil anarchy ruled the land.... The wicked still come here to sacrafice. What was that? We've got to do something. They call me Green Jack ma'am. You don't mean to eat me, do you ma'am? That would be a shame, Miss Meg. You're so lovely. You deserve far better than scrawny little me.... All the heavenly angels must envy your beauty. Let me go and I'll sing songs of praise to you. But....but....don't you like my words? Then fill your soul with loveliness. Look into your glass and feast on beauty. My shield would serve you well. Your radiance is the alchemy that makes rusted steel shine like silver. Better, you are a queen without a peer.... a reigning angel. I did it! How's Screwball? Then on to victory! What's that? He won't fool me. In here! I've found a passage! Doesn't make sense.... Check the walls. There must be some sort of secret key.... How can you sing at a time like this? Just what sort of fix is that? Only dead meat waits for the stewpot! Spring the lock, Gump! I know I promised.... but it's the only way.... Sure it's a secret... It'll keep forever when we're all dead.... Why not have Luna fly out between the bars and find a key? Not if she changes sizes like she can! That's easy enough. Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind. It's not possible. I'm in love.... No.... this isn't real.... I can't do it....! This is faerie glamour! Threats can't make you love you. Human hearts don't work that way. Luna....? I.... didn't mean to hurt her. Not without a fight! Keep behind me in case there's trouble. Quiet! Wish we could repay the favour! And Lili! Wait....! Better to search in teams, Gump and me together. Brown TOm, you and Screwball look in the other direction. Let's hurry! I'll scramble that one! Not even kings live like this.... My God! Gump, look! It's Lili! Lili ! Li-li ! The Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow edge of disaster. She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug chunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss. It's Ja-ack ! It's her. I know it. I've got to reach her! This way! There she is....! Lili....! Demons! Come on! Lili! Wait! Why did you stop me? What has he done to her? Some champion.... What good is this fancy sword? He means to kill the mare, Gump! Wait a minute....! I think I know a way. Lili....? Can you hear me....? ....Lili....? Over here.... By the door.... Thank God you're all right! I didn't know what to do.... I never want to lose you again.... It's me, you can be sure of that.... and there's magic on our side, too. My fault as much as yours.... Don't worry. We're here to save you. I didn't do anything.... let me see your face. It will give me hope.... ....just to glimpse your smile.... Lili....? I love you.... Let's get started! What we need to do is sneak back into the kitchen and gather all the plates and platters.... Remember....just the shiny ones.... Up we go! Your turn, Blunder. Over here! Gotcha! Best you can do? Got to catch me first! Hate to break up the party, but there's work to be done! Smoke rising.... That chimney must go clear to the top. I'm proud of you, Screwball.  Don't drop it.... How's that, Gump? ....I'm all right....Let's get on....to the dungeon.... Everything's ready.... ....oh, God....! Lili.... Come on, Screwball.... Gump, wait! I trust her! No....! Don't...! I trust her, Gump....I'll always trust her.... Burn....! You evil bastard.... Darkness....! You rotten filth! ....haven't killed me yet.... No....! I'm not! I'm human.... I....don't know.... ....I....can't remember.... All my life....! I...I.... know who I am.... .....together....? How is Lili? We'll meet again, dear friends.... I'm everywhere, Lili....my spirit lives in everything.... I....love.....you... I'm always here, Lili.... whenever you come...."

This car has to go back where it came from. It was brought here by mistake. It wasn't supposed to go anywhere. It needs to go back where it came from. The guy who sold it to you made a mistake. That's my dad. It wasn't his to sell. Yeah, but I'm just telling you it was a mistake, OK, so it needs to go back where it came from.  I don't get why what I think doesn't matter. Yeah, why not? When do you look at it? When was the last time you got off the couch? Neither are all the pills you're taking, but I don't tell you not to take them. I do. Can I have some money so I can buy lunch today? Nothing. I was just, I was just going to school. I, I didn't know anyone was here.  Fine. Yeah, we moved in with my Grandma for a little while.

I didn't start anything. He pushed me. Not really. I don't understand the part about how it's not important that he pushed me and he punched me and he kicked me and he told me to suck his cock and now I'm the bad guy sitting in the office. Yeah, but I didn't - Yeah, OK. Hey. Pretty much sucked. I don't know. It just sucked. Do you want me to turn on the light for you? I don't know, maybe, a little. Whose are they?

Please stop saying that. Home. No thanks. Fine, just don't talk to me. Get that away from me. Hey, what are you doing? Stop the car, I want to get out. Come on man, let's just go. Hey.

I told you a hundred times. Yes I did. You're just not listening. What difference does it make? Shut the fuck up. What? Did you hear what he just said? My room!? You gonna start punishing me now? Shit, dad. I'm really sorry you had your ass dragged off the couch. I'm sorry you had to put some fucking underpants on for the first time in months. What?! Oh, what, soon as I'm right, that's enough?! Fine. Fuck this. Can I talk to you? I need to talk to you. I came to talk to him. It's none of your business. Just leave me alone. I got the money. The money for the car. You said if I got eighteen hundred dollars I could have the car back. What? What do you mean- What are you talking about? Where's it gone?!  Where's it gone? What's going on? What!? What do you mean? Oh, Jesus. What happened? Ah, hi. It's TJ here. I, ah, I'm sorry to bug you, but um, I don't know, I guess I wanted to talk to you right now. I don't know. I have a present for you too, so maybe I'll just come drop it off or something, or ah, yeah... Um, OK. Bye. What are you doing? It's starting to rain. Fuck you. Fuck you fuck you fuck you. Fuck you.

If you're lying, I'm gonna cut off every one of your fingers. What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you? You cut his nose off. You just cut his nose off! Hold this against your face. You gotta stop the bleeding. I want you outta my life. I'm serious. I never want to see you again. How many times do I have say it? Hi.  Pizza's here, I need money.

And I'm sorry I called you a fat prostitute. You're not fat. I dunno. Maybe. Sorry. Come in. Hey. Look at you. I hardly recognize you. Gone where?"
defiance,TUVIA ,Daniel Craig," And no news of my brothers? If you stay, you'll have to go to the ghetto. I need to see to my family. Will you come? If I was a German you are dead. There is no more army. Asael worships his big brother. It wasn't war. It was something else. Zus eyes him carefully. Where is Sonia and the baby? In Novgrudok. She wouldn't leave. She is still my wife. No. Do you? Is there anything left to eat? Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among them. You think Wilencki is going to give us food? How? And he tells the police. He was willing to help us. This is your plan? To terrorize every anti-Semite in Belorussia? Peasant. We don't know he did it. We don't know he did it. Machine guns? You're going to take on the whole German army? Set her down. The man lowers the child to the ground. She isn't moving. I'll go ask Koscik for food. And the pistol. Without another word, he starts off. I cannot thank you enough. They sit in Koscik's warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik's WIFE stands silently by the stove, glaring at Tuvia. He said the same of you. Tuvia can't help but notice Koscik's wife giving him the evil eye. Koscik produces a bottle of vodka. What am I supposed to do with-- --And feed them how? I can't care for my own family. Behind them, several of the REFUGEES have emerged from their hiding place. They stare at Tuvia balefully. Those men? They were the ones who killed my parents? Imagine being one. Tuvia leads his motley band toward the woods. I thought you were dead. Zus. He's with the other two. For a dumb schoolboy, you mean. It is just like school, I don't know what you're talking about.  Teacher...Come... Come. (gesturing to the You send me? Only four bullets. You know who I am? The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified. One of the SONS stands. Tuvia turns the gun on him. Sit. The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is deafening. Tuvia turns back to the Police Captain. And you know why I am here. You have no idea what I'm talking about... To find Jews. And it's a good job, isn't it? You like your job. My father? You don't talk about my father... Tuvia places the pistol against the man's forehead. Down on your knees. For my parents, David and Beila Bielski... for my brothers and all the others-- Tell them who did this. Riboynoy shel oylam, riboynoy shel oylam...  Lord of the universe, forgive me, I have murdered -- but they were monsters and did not deserve to live. His sons. Zus nods his approval. What? Shut up. Tuvia stares into the fire. He is dirty and tired. Zus looks around. I don't know-- You're afraid he's going to beat you for forgetting your homework. I agree. But they're here. They consider their predicament. We'll sleep farther up the trail. If anyone comes, they'll find them first. The gunshots will give us time to escape. No more. I know. I know... Tamara, you remember Cousin Zus. Please, go sit down by the fire. And this is Lazar -- Isabel's youngest... Tamara is pleasant-looking but emotionally wounded. This is Isaac Malbin. From Minsk. Malbin is sweet-faced with little round Trotsky glasses. Asael, find them something to eat. They are family. We'll water the soup. One of the new arrivals is a DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY. Tuvia and Zus watch her pass. Zus is particularly interested. No. By the fire, the veterans pepper the newcomers with Fuck me! Have you never used a hammer? What is it you do, then? This is a job? I see. Congratulations. Zus winks and walks past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them. As long as his village wife stays in hiding. This is all the food we have. You are welcome to share. Come. Sit. Put down your guns. Where are you from? The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia: I know. I don't know. No. An armed brigade. Here? --we must get what we need without killing. We can't make more enemies-- Zus concentrates on opening the breach. --It won't bring your family back to life. Or Mama. Or Papa. And I can still see their faces. So this is God's work you're doing, Zussie? We cannot become...like them. Us?  You are making the decisions now? A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for command has grown more obvious. We wait for dark. We did. Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead courier with them. Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for miles. Hurry--! Into the fields! RUN! Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle and begins to FIRE at the approaching trucks. Jacov, NO! THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off and begin RETURNING FIRE. Jacov is CUT DOWN by a MACHINE GUN. Peretz, Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It's not clear if they can make it into the woods. A FLARE IGNITES OVERHEAD turning the wheat fields BRIGHT WHITE in flickering incandescence. Malbin is almost paralytic with fear. ASAEL doesn't know which way to run. He plunges into the WHEAT FIELD...but ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD. ONE OF THE TRUCKS drives forward, CUTTING HIM OFF, using its SPOTLIGHT to reveal him. FIFTEEN SOLDIERS start after him. Zus. His rifle. Zus races back to pick up Peretz's weapon. Asael... He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think he's going to go back after him. Instead, he wedges the rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim... No. Again I have no idea what you are talking about. Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces. Enough! I said, enough!  Get up! Get up! He made a mistake! That's right, Zus. No mistakes. Like last night.  First they will torture Asael...and then they will hang him. Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground. You know me? I know we have no food. But tomorrow... tomorrow will be another mission. That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard. We could be here a long time. And we have to prepare. Better security. Better at getting food and information-- (talking over their I want to kill Nazis, too, but we...just...cannot afford revenge. Not right now. We cannot afford to lose friends like Jacov and Peretz. A small voice speaks up. Or Asael. We... We-- (trying to hold it ...We will map out where we've been so as to not visit the same farms too often. And we take only from those who can afford to give, and leave those who can't alone. True. But what I am saying is... what I mean is... We are not thieves. (his resolve growing with every word) Or murderers. We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals.  We have all chosen this -- to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings. His mission statement. A vision of their future. Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head. The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader. Now. They leave their cover and approach warily, guns at the ready. Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In Russian: I'm sorry. Thank God. Thank you. We need to know what's going on in the villages, how the Germans patrol, who the informers are-- He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead he is watching as Chaya walks past. Are you listening to me? What's her name? So talk to her. You spent three days in a cellar! Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation. Whose turn to go? You go along, just to make sure he understands my orders. Asael nods.  Go on...Go! What is it? Thank you for telling me.  We have to dig a trench around the new zemylanka. If it rains I'm afraid water will seep in. Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news. She was a beautiful woman. But cold. Not a day went by she didn't remind me I wasn't a good provider. For years it wasn't really a marriage at all. And now... He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him. Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us. Asael, keep them moving. Don't stop! THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods. Go! Go! Move!  Isaac, keep them moving! Zus, Asael, Ben Zion... Tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions while the others escape.- The policemen emerge hurriedly through the trees and begin crossing the river. SHOTS rings out. A Policeman goes down. The German Soldier is shot in the leg. They are dragged from the water. You are from Belarussia, pig! Why do you work for the Germans against your own people? Soon it will be dark... See how you find your way home then! The policemen are having similar thoughts. They'll be back.  We have to find a new camp. What does that mean? Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude. However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on.  A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades. We belong to the Bielski otriad. I'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander. When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing. And we fight a common enemy. The motherland doesn't distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma. These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment. We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came. As if we have a choice. (throwing a smaller I haven't read one in years. Malbin looks up from his work. I wasn't a very good student. You can ask Shimon. Yet you accept me as Commander. ...But--? Such as? Malbin tries to think how best to put it. You have more ideas? About all this? I'm listening... We'll do what we can. We must send for whoever is left alive. Then we will provide. I won't let that happen. Tuvia exchanges a glance with Malbin. Zus catches it. He has sensed Malbin's growing influence. No. I'll bring them out myself. Yes. I cannot have you contradicting me... Not when others are around.  Our family must stick together. Don't call them that. They are people. Jews. --What about Bella? Tuvia looks over at Bella, who is anxiously watching. --You think she'd be with you if it wasn't for what is happening here? Zus glares at him, but tries to control himself. --Is it love Zus? You are the man of her dreams? The Romeo of Novagrudok? Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates into fists and elbows. Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him. This way. There are rumors. Of death camps. What if we were to take all of you? We will protect you. We have made alliances with the Russian Partisans. YOU WANT TIME? Fine, I give you a day. A month. Maybe a year. To live!  Your daughter is out there with us.  Your husband is waiting for you. An old orthodox RABBI stands nearby. Rabbi? Can you repair guns?  See if you can fix this trigger. Oppenheim slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the mechanism. It sticks. He digs into his pocket and produces a small file and expertly begins to shave the metal spur. He tests it, then hands it back to Tuvia, who CLICKS the trigger. You have a new profession. A murmur of appreciation ripples through the group as Shulman appears -- leading A MAGNIFICENT WHITE HORSE. My God, she's beautiful.  May I? He mounts her easily, urges her around the perimeter, greeting the new arrivals. Heads turn as he trots past. He is the center of attention, and he knows it. And likes it. Friends, we are happy to see you safely among us. But there are many things you must learn about living here... All attention turns to him. The Lubczanski brothers grumble to each other, none too pleased with Tuvia's show-boating. Once you are settled, you'll be assigned work duties. Everyone works, no exceptions. We will help supply the Russian Partisans by making clothes, repairing guns. Women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men. Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft. This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You will all learn to protect yourselves. A LITTLE BOY holds Lilka's hand and looks up at Tuvia in wonder. He cuts an iconic figure. Madness. Send out more missions. And bring shotguns. Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes. Lilka? Everyone here has lost someone. She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed.  Here... He takes off his wool coat and puts it around her shoulders. I will have Asael send someone else. You know how to use this? She nods. Leaving, she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who are on their way in. She is not my aristocrat. Lazar. I am coming from camp. The danger is from those coming to camp. No sign of the food mission? What's wrong with them all? Medicine for typhus. I heard you. I'll go see Viktor right away. On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked after. Are you all right? I must go. We have sickness. I need ampicillin. If typhus breaks out in our camp, it may spread to yours. I must insist. Comrade. Of course. Zus grabs his submachine gun. I'm going in with you. You don't have to do this. So more die. They will anyway. A grim smile from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside. Zus...  For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the shadows. But rather than follow them into the police station, we HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire. Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history. What about the others?! The others? So you're a communist now, Zus? Zus lays his head back on the seat, closes his eyes. Come back to us. Zus won't look at him. You are my brother. Whassa problem, Arkady? Policy is...Same for all. If someone is stealing he'll face consequences. Asael is astonished that Tuvia would go against him in public and embarrassed by his public drunkenness. Reduced rations for one week.  Both of you.nan  This matter is settled. Everybody back in line. People are staring at him. Yes. I know. --What? .Maybe they're right. Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized. Zus. He has made his choice. He reels away toward the woods. ...the way they look at me... with their pasty faces. Let them starve, we're all going to die out here anyway. ...Moses. I am not a leader. How long was I asleep? And you've nursed me the whole time? Did you study nursing at university? I never went to university. My wife's father had a store. Before the Race Laws.  She is is dead. Tell me more about university. I'd love to hear you play. Who doesn't? Chopin the butcher from Novogrudok. Thank you, Lilka. What happened? Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others. Tuvia strides over to them. What is this? Against my orders... As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands.  Asael! Asael comes running. Get a message to Zus. He's got to tell Viktor they're coming. Do you hear that? This is against my orders. I cannot allow it. He turns away. I cannot keep the living alive. Tamara and the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate. Lilka... Shhh.. The Germans are coming into the forest. I don't know what is going to become of us. No. You have saved mine. He reaches for her but before they can begin to make love again-- THE BLANKET DOOR IS PUSHED ASIDE. Malbin is there. Yes? They're coming for us. Group members have begun to gather around him. They begin to hurl insults -- schtik drek, paskudnyak -- as the hapless man is pushed to his knees. Entrance points, wetlands, obstacles.  You read this.  Did you reach Viktor? Reeboynoy shel oylum... Lord of the Universe. We have done unspeakable things yet still I seek your mercy... He HEARS something. Malbin waits at the edge of the forest. His face is drawn and pale from what has just happened. We can't fight an entire division. We've done our part for the Motherland. And the others? Old people, women and children. And if I refuse? Tomorrow is Passover. Yes? Moses. The Exodus. Malbin doesn't get it at first. --He left before Pharaoh could stop them. Now Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon. We leave now. Spread the word. Don't try to fight... Just slow them down. Then join us. Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely. Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia. Come. He forces her to join him and catch up to the others. Show me. Are the others back yet? (Malbin looks stricken; he shakes his head) ..Asael? Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back. Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her. You have a weapon? She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks into her eyes. Use it on yourself before you let them take you. She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts. Each person takes care of the other.  .Give him your belt. Asael nods at Tuvia gratefully. The group is hushed, apprehensive. Then: No tracks on land. Get back in. It is almost impossible to make any progress. Especially when one is weak and malnourished. Come... Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no. He can't go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him onward. Take off your glasses. Reflections. Tuvia moves off to check on the others. We're lost. Not a sound. Pass the word. We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line. Parents hold hands over their childrens' mouths. Shimon is carried on an improvised litter made of branches. Right here. Shimon is at the end. Shhhh... Ridiculous. Back to the river! He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering. THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench. They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children. Only weapons and ammunition! Spread the word. Tuvia hands him the machine gun. Go on. Lilka is carrying a small child. Lilka, please help. We've got to get the injured into the forest. Everybody gather your things! We have to get out of the open! Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her. Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles. He yells to Shulman. Shulman! Weapons only! Tell them.  You've been promoted. Congratulations! Tuvia turns, sees Bella with Zus. They see him. Zus hands Bella the machine gun from the tank and approaches. Where is the rest of your unit? You are going back? We've got to build a new camp. Zus nods. Don't you hear it? Nothing. Isn't it beautiful? We HOLD on Tuvia. He has aged ten years in one."
hellraiser,LARRY ,Andrew Robinson," It's one of these. 0.K.  0.K.  Like who? Ah! Success. Well.  This is it. It's just been empty a while.  Besides, it's an old house. The best part of ten years. I wanted to sell it off at one point, after the old Lady died, but I couldn't get Frank to agree.  Christ.  It's not been touched. Look at this.  I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.  We'll sell it.  Sell everything. He won't complain.  He can pay off some of his creditors. You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it.  She'll love it. You don't like it? You're still blaming me. You wanted to come back to London.  We came back. So what's the argument? Oh Christ.  Julia ...  Shit. I hear you. Where are you? Frank. He's been here.  There's stuff in the kitchen.  He must have made a hasty exit. Hello ...?  Is there anybody there?  There's nobody there - I'm surprised it's even connected ... Who's there? Kirsty? Where are you?  What did you say? I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile? You'd like the house. Do you want me to come over? Well I want you to see the house. Well come over, will you? See the place? O.K. Honey. Well you take care. I love you. Well?  We'll move in Sunday. Wait!  Wait!  Watch the fucking paint work. Just take it slowly. It'll go in.  Alright, let's give it another try. How are you doing through there? I'll get it. Honey! You like? I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved. Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh?  She hates moving.  Kirsty. Kitchen's through on your left Uh-huh. Her mother's dead. Julia's my second wife. Damn right.  Now are we going to move the bed or not?  Are you O.K.? Wait!  Wait! Slowly, will you?  Slowly!  Will you take the weight while I take a step up? Christ! My fucking hand! You fucking ass-holes. ... Oh Christ ... ... oh ... Christ ...  ... Julia ... I cut myself. I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.  Shit. I'm going to throw up. So damn stupid. I'll be scarred for life. - always hated the sight of my own blood.  I go out like a light. Anybody else's?  no problem.  But mine ... you know ... goes straight to my head.  Anyhow, this damn doctor's poking around and I'm saying: I'm going to pass out, and he's saying, no you're not, no you're not.  Next thing I know - - I wake up On the floor. I should do it! I know.  And he's saying: I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. Right ... (he has picked up the brandy bottle) Anyone for more? Come on, you're only young once -  What are you drinking, love? Steve? Are you O.K.? Bill?  Absolutely not.  Sit down.  We've got celebrating to do. Only when I laugh. It's round on the left -  Sweetheart?  Where are you? Are you there?  Julia? Are you there? Julia?  Sweetheart ... I've been calling you. Oh, babe ... Can I get you anything? Sure. O.K. Julia?   Are you all right? O.K. Hello? I'm O.K., honey.  It's all right ... Never better.  You sleep well. I love you, honey. Kirsty. Is this upsetting you? Are you all right? Only I'll turn it off - What was that? No.  Something else. No.  I'll do it. What's wrong with you? I'm here. Oh baby. Come with me then. We must have rats. See?  Quite safe. ... oh babe ... ...I love you, honey ... let me ... oh God ... I love you ... Oh baby ... I love you ...  Huh? What's wrong with you? I don't understand you.  One moment you're all over me, the next it's:  Don't touch me. ... maybe we should never have come back. I guess. You don't like her at all do you? She doesn't even want to leave the house. It's like she's waiting for something. I don't know.  I don't know. It's beyond me.  Would you ... maybe call round sometime?  Try to make friends. Maybe all she needs is some company.  Julia? What's wrong? What are you talking about? Of course. It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right ... Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.  He's gone. He was insane, baby:  a mad dog. I put him out of his misery - I'll go to the police, when I'm feeling stronger.  Try and find some way to make them understand, though God knows I don't really understand myself.  Did he hurt you?  Poor Frank.  He's better off dead. I'm afraid it's true. No you don't.  Show her. Where are you going? Stay with me - - it's all right.   Really it is ... Come to Daddy. Come to Daddy."
arbitrage,ROBERT ,Richard Gere," I'm a child of the 50's. My father welded steel for the Navy. And my mother worked at the VA. They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen. When I was a kid my favorite teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James said that world events always revolve around five things: (extending his fingers one- BY-ONE) M-O-N-E-Y. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 2. This was fifth-grade econ.  But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this-- limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst. Quants? Derivatives structures? What was that about? That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there? And did we sign? No. We did not. Instead I fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting... And where was Mayfield? What was this ""emergency""? What was that about? Why? Hi, guys! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5.  It's my job! It's my job. You guys turned out fine!  How you doin', son? Good?  No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here? Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday! What did Mark Twain say about? He said-- old age... is clearly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.  I've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around-- at all these shining, radiant faces, I know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... I'm deeply proud of all of you. That's the best gift your mother and I could have hoped for,  so, thank you...  That, too, Peter, but- no business tonight-- no business! Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too! Now, I'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important -- and it's you guys so thank you all very much. Kids are wild. No, no no, you should have-- I want more ""you's"" around. Yeah, yeah yeah... What?  Yeah, well... I just... wanted it to be about the family tonight.  Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can.  Well, you gonna keep skirting around it? My darling, you are still in your 20's. I am 60. That's a big difference in point of view.  It catches up alright. And maybe there's some other things I'd like to do. Maybe I would like to spend a little more time with you guys... outside the office.  What? Office. Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.  I'll be back as soon as I can.  Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When you get this -- I want you to call Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I need to see him right away, okay? Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm always late-- you know that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm always saying I'm sorry about being late.  It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather be here with you. The show's gonna be beautiful.  I will be there.  Oh wow, that's great. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 11. You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very... I'm here. Jeffrey, I told you, I'm...  Jeffrey... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 12. What do you want me to say? I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly. As soon as they sign the contract. ...Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!... You were a friend of mine!... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13.  Are we done here? I think we're done here.  You can't do that... ...I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again?  Not your fuckin problem...  Let's go.  What?  Good. Very good. Is this too blue? Ay, yay yay. I look old. They haven't signed the papers.  So did I, but for some reason they're stalling. I didn't get any sleep on the plane and... What plan is that?  You sound like a fortune cookie. Then you married an idiot.  There hasn't been time. I don't wanna be in the cemetery! I'm taking care of it. I've had to move some things around for the merger.  Only two million? You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals... two bucks... all you can eat... three bucks...  I don't know what you're talking about...  Where the hell is Mayfield?  I hope they didn't beat you up too much. I'd love to hear about that, but...  I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to join us tonight. I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here nearly two hours now. Where is Mr. Mayfield? Detained where?  Alright, I think I can leave you with my family? Yeah, yeah yeah. No. What's up? What is it?  BROOKE-- What kind of entries? Alright, come by about eleven tomorrow and we'll look at it then. And Brooke? See if you can find out what happened to Mayfield. How're they doing? Yeah, but how are they doing? Where's Julie? Hey, Julie. Oh, really? Painter?  Yeah, that's great. (as he notices Julie leave, to the group)  Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22. ROBERT I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second. What? Why are you doing this? I will take  those two. And the Rubik's cube on the back wall. Don't tell her it was me.  I mean it. It's me. I'm here. I'm in your bedroom. Can you get those people out of here? Look down the hall. Do you see me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24. Okay, so I'm serious. I thought we should talk... ...I was working, do you understand? I'm under enormous pressure, I have obligations... I was there! I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I'm here now. I'm sorry. Because I liked them. Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail? You know, I'm not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business, you have to project a certain image. Success. The market's a disaster right now; nobody's moving anything. That's why you gotta show sales. People look at you then and they say ""Whoah, how'd she do that?"" -- and that's what they remember. Always. Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go... There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that.  Yes, I wanna make it collect... Lawrence Grant. Jimmy, it's me. I want you to listen to me very closely... Let's go. It's better you don't ask. That's correct. No, you're not. We're not here. We're both alseep right now. At home. Which is where you left your phone, right? Because if anyone checks... They're not, as long as we're not here. Anybody know you're here? Somebody knows you're here? But somebody knows-- you're not there. Oh, Jesus, Jimmy... What'd you say? Do you trust her? Do you trust her? Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates -- I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours. Jimmy... ...what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'...  Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help. No, I just... have to get home... I'll deal with it in a couple of hours. Then I don't make it.  Better we don't talk for a while. I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just go home. I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed. What? I just went to... eat some ice cream.  Yes... Ellen... Do you still love me? And such a person... Fingerprints, DNA? What about cell phone records? Not from a cell phone, no. What would you advise such a person to do? Failing which? Yeah. I know. You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses? And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on-- fraud conviction gets me twenty years?  What choice do I really have? Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee.  You know this. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 37. No. Absolutely not. That's impossible. The audit's cleared? You're leaving?  And why?  Get out.  What? What? What the fuck are you talking about? Oh... Oh, it was fine... He's here? Where? He called? You think we're dealing with a fucking idiot? That's being issued now. Never mind that, just find out why Mayfield hasn't called us. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 39. Do I have to do every Goddamn thing myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU PLEASE...? THANK YOU! Reconcile what? Of course I'm listening.  Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don't get audited on the same balance sheet.  That's ridiculous. That can't be right. Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it.  Yeah.  Give me two minutes, then send him in... Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later. Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41. Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible. Correct. Through... I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation. Last night, at the gallery. No, I think I left about ten. Home. Yeah. Yeah.  Yes. See her with anyone-- what do you mean? Not that I noticed. No. No, no. The driver? This is awful. This is truly awful. Actually we didn't talk about personal matters. Well not an employee. I was an investor. Why did I invest? She had a great eye. She found me  those Bryce Marden's there. They went up in value very quickly, and on the basis of that I agreed to fund some of the gallery. Why would I mind? Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure, go ahead. Mmm-hmm? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 44. Actually I said that she wasn't an employee, but-- I think she'd just come over from Paris if I remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers. It was through our holding company. You seem a little confused by all this... Alright. But you're going to be indelicate... Oh, okay, I get it, so why would I invest in her and help her find a place? It's very simple, detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she'd do well, so I backed her, she did. It's is simple as that. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 45. Sure. What?  Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet. This morning. Yeah. Me, too. No problem.  Her Mom...? Service here? Well we should pick up the expenses for that. Whatever she wants. You'll take care of that personally, for me? You reach Mayfield? Thanks. Appreciate your concern. You're gonna sign him out? The basketball player? He's the best? You've gotta get Jimmy out of this. What would he be looking at? Come on, get in. Jimmy... It's gonna be okay. We've got you the best criminal lawyer-- Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay? Your under suspicion. I am aware of that. I couldn't. Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt. Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand...? People rely on me. Listen... I want to talk to you a second. Come here. I wanna show you something. Now, you know, your father asked me to look after you. Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that.  So I've been able to set up a situation for you. It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that. What else is there?  What are you gonna do? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56. I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you? Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just-- read it. Just take it home and read it. It's not gonna hurt you.  What? Yeah, put him through...  Chris...  What...? Chris... Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 57. Tell me what is going on. Tell me what's going on! Why not?! What do you mean it's not...?  The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed?  Then... why did you tell me that it didn't? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 61. They? Who's they?  Who is they?!  Mayfield? They're negotiating. He wants a better price.  Sherry Netherland...? Yes, James Mayfield, please...  Mr. Mayfield... I think it's time we had a talk. Did we have a meeting?  Sweetie, you okay? What's wrong? You wanna sit? I did. Because I hoped you wouldn't. I made a bad bet. That's a dangerous word, Brooke. Because we were going broke! Everything was finished. We'd have nothing. You remember Alexanderov? Well he came to see me one day last year. He said ""Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months."" So, I go check it out. And the geological survey's right, friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it, right? Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune.   Goldenrod - 4.17.11 65. ROBERT But then there's something I hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so I gotta make it up, I gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. You can't stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle, I've done housing, I've arb'd credit swaps, I have done it all, and yes, again, I know it's outside the charter, but it is FUCKING MINTING MONEY! IT'S A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY! FOR EVERYBODY! FOREVER! IT IS GOD!... Until it's not... The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will.  It's like a plane crash. It just happens. Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And like every father I pray that it doesn't HAPPEN to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you... Nobody's getting arrested. That's why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plug the hole, I put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, I transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. At least we get to keep the house. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 66. Yes. You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it. What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt?  Because it's my job! You are not my partner! You work for me!  That's right. You work for me!  Everybody works for me! Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please? Please. Just, just come here. Just for a second and sit down.  There's something I wanna tell you. And whatever you decide I won't blame you...  I'm on my own path. It's up to you to move with it or against it. But I'm the patriarch; that's my role. And I have to play it.  I'm sorry. You're certain?  He's not like us.  I don't know. She's good. Fine.  Why? Yes...? The estate lawyer? Not to me. I am so, so sorry.  No... It's just...  not fair, is it?  This shouldn't have happened. You keep sending people to my office to ""do business."" With the intricacies of my operation so that you can... not buy it?  Just coffee, please. Fuck you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 80. FUCK - YOU. I'm the Oracle of Gracie Square. You came to me. I did not come to you. No, no, no. Forget it, forget it... Forget the deal. I don't even care about the deal. No, I run a comfortable -- excuse me -- I run a THRIVING business, that has returned year-to-date 15.4% percent to our investors, or approximately $583 Million dollars from a trading operation that you don't have and that we both know that you need, or else you never would've called me in the first place. You on the other hand, you've taken a salary of (sotto from the waitress pouring his coffee) 18 Million?  And what have you delivered? A falling stock price of negative 14 dollars? Is that what it is? You've also lost approximately... THREE AND A HALF BILLION FOR YOUR INVESTORS- TELL ME -- WHY - THE FUCK - DO I - NEED YOU? ...so we issue a press release today, say there is no deal, never was a deal. You're not gonna be buying Old Hill, you're not gonna be buying Quantum- you're not gonna be buying anything; You? You're just a browser. Now, me? I'll continue to enjoy my earnings, and while I SOAR on princely wings, to my next winning enterprise, your stock drops another couple bucks on yet another - failed - acquisition - attempt. Bodes well for your tenure, doesn't it? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 81. You have a nice day, James. Five-fifty. Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no?  And if it's no, send any further communication right to my trash can.  One other thing -- six months and I'm gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My daughter's gonna take it over. You know her, you trust her. And you're gonna have to make my son a VP. No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no? I'm writing the deal.  I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it. I'm fine... Before I go -- how much would you have paid...? Four seventy-five.  Yeah. Actually, I lied. I would've taken four. ...Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions?  Yes, everyone but you.  Alright, it's a great day. Your hard work made it happen I met his price. I just took it out of your share. Yeah. Well, thank you. Now go get me that fucking hospital check.  Yeah. Hello. What you got? You got any milk? I'll take a water. Where are you going? The boxes. I told you not to take the toll. I said ""Listen to what I have to tell you and follow my directions, listen to me closely, do the following just like I say."" But you took the toll anyway. Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie to me... So where'd they get the photograph from? So, you're saying... it's a fake? Don't be such a wiseass...  What plan? What business? What's an Applebee's? You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?  It's not really that simple, Jimmy. I'm in a situation now. I told you... right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs, families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that?  It was an accident.  Can you just hang tight? Just a little longer?  Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit. He says he didn't take the toll.  Does Standard have clawback? Let's just say I decide to go in... No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal? Four years, you think?  Call the DA, get it started.  Yeah, Glen. Did Mrs. Miller say where she was going tonight...? Aha... No, I'm sure... I'll try her cell.  Syd...? Yeah- Did you make that call to the DA yet...? Thank God. No, no, no. No. Listen to me, call Earl, tell him to get his car, tell him to meet us at my house in twenty minutes... And, Syd...? Bring a notary.  Wait. Wait. Just wait.  The Lexus- that's your car, your plate?  You got Jimmy's? Son of a bitch. You didn't hurt anybody. You helped a lot of people. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 95. No, it makes it easier. No. Okay, we're even. But just for the record though, what you did...  Was way beyond the money.  Thanks a lot. Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna get there...? I don't wanna get there too soon...  You okay? What is it? Did she tell you that? Yeah, I explained to Brooke that... Yes. What?  Ellen I don't know what you think you know... What do you think you know? I did what was necessary. For my interests? Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business.  What you've tolerated? Wow! What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them?  It's cause you didn't want to give `em up! No, I kept her out. What is this? ""All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?"" Did you really expect me to sign this thing? Apparently not, no. No. Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.  This is fuckin' crazy. You're out of your mind. I am not signing that. I will not sign that!  That's fucking ridiculous! What...  Are you trying to blackmail me? You're not gonna win that one. There's no fucking way.  Fucking lawyer... Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!  You won't do it. You won't do this. You won't do it to the kids. It's how it all works, Ellen. You know that. She'll be better for it. The world is cold. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 101."
tron,FLYNN ,Jeff Bridges," Come on, you scuzzy little data, be in there... I've got such nice blue paper to print you out on, if you'll just sit still... It's all in the wrist, friends.  Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple. Good luck. You can't even think in here.  Come on.  So...how's the world of serious science? Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor? Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know... Tried to. (nods toward terminal) Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...  ""Embezzling"" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.  You haven't told him?  Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called... (waves at one of the games in the room) ...Space Paranoids. Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has ""invented"" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.? Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime. Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it. My password ... Dillinger's instruction to divert the data ... Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight. Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high.. Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it... Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access... Hi, Alan.  My dinner. Want one? Move aside. Let the kid have some room. Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running... Hey hey, it's that big Master Control Program everybody's talking about... You don't look a thing like your pictures... Tell me, have you really been thinking about world domination like they say?  CODE SERIES LSU-123 ... activate. CODE SERIES ESS-999 ... activate. CODE SERIES HHH-888 ... activate. Now, how do you expect to run the universe if you let a few unsolvable problems throw you like that? C'mon, big boy, let's see what... Games, huh? I'll give you -- Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only thinks it's happening... Hey! Take it easy! Look, if this is about those parking tickets, I can explain everything...  Who you callin' ""program,"" program? Hey! Who are you guys? What's the story around here? Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?  Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody. Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?  Yeah, yeah -- that's great. Oh, uh...I don't remember too much... Looks like we're in the same boat here - No, I Hey!  Okay! Here's an easy one...  No! No! Out of my way, zero bit.  Tron...? Alan! Well, isn't it -- ?  I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...? Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP I know...  Nice one!  You guys...follow me.  Watch it! Oh man...when you're on the other side of the screen...it all looks so easy...  It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...  Well...my home ""sector"" was called Paramus ...  It grows on you. Feel what? You okay?  Hey, what's that?  well... when do we pay a call on the ol' Master Control?  You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters? Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows what to - What's that?  How about over there...that empty memory? You gonna make it?  What's goin' on?  Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us - You okay? You don't look so good. Hang on. We'll get you outta here. Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out... Hey... ! Never gonna figure out how to work this thing... Okay -- hold it right there!  What do you mean, ""'yes""? That all you can say? Oh. Anything else? only yes and no...  You're a bit. where's your program? Won't it miss you? I'm your program?  Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate? Like so? Way to go! We're haulin'! This honey doesn't handle so good in town...  Catch me listening to you again. Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine. Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks for your concern. So long.  This town's full o' live ones. This is where Tron said he was going... Looks like his kind of place, too... real serious. Sshhh I'm still me. Just a different color. C'mon. Greetings, program... Yeah, I... oops! I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it. No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it. It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.  Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...  You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever. Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on. I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.  So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move? All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least. What about our friend - Sark? Not us, I hope. Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?  What's wrong with that area? Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go. There's another beam!  Did we make it? Hooray for our side... Hey... you guys OK? Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...  Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head (looks around -- to Yori) Are we there yet, Mommy? Not me, boss. Hey!  Look, the door's almost... Yori! I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit! Let's get outta here. Check out the controls.  We're getting closer. I can rev this baby up a little  Wait a minute Yori! YORI!! LOOK! Let's get some power here. Any response? YORI It's starting Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.  Jump.  Probably.  Shhhhh.  I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if... just once... Don't worry. Hey -- you guys I know, I met him. I mean, I saw it read-up - hey, look at this. And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on. You're telling me... you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for? Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then... Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap? Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life..."
philadelphia,ANDREW ,Tom Hanks," Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results... Limestone. Messy, but innocuous. Defined by Webster's as harmless. Your Honor, Counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. But nothing could be further from the truth. Rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers! Granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of Philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society. ... plaintiff's permission or  ... complainant seeks authorization...               relief... You. Client of yours? Sure. Just the dazzling paralegal I wanted to see. Thanks, Kenneth.  Your exam! Ninety-eight?! Ninety-eight! No. Great. Thanks, Shelby.  It's 6:30, go home. Rach. Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall. Present. Hi, Mom. It's me. I'm fine. Hold on, Mom. (punching into the conference call) There's no way my client will go along with that. Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I'm sorry I interrupted... Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too. Ah hah! Yes!  Rentworth v. Pennsylvania... court of appeals affirms jury award of punitive damages for wrongful interference with prospective economic relations... Walter. In a word, Bob... I was just about to take a break. Good evening, Charles. We're gonna miss you around here, Bob... The fate of the participants interests me, yes sir. It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement. Sorry, Charles, but... I'd like to see Kronos win. Because they deserve to, Walter. If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull. Bailey, Brackman. Yes! Thanks, Walter. Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.  Thanks, Charles.  It's good to be King. Uh huh. Chandra? Don't you think this color's a little... orange for me?  Thanks, Bruno.  I've been out of the office four days. I don't want them to think I've been to the beach.  Okay. Check this out. Hides everything, right? What do you think?  Tootsie!  Excuse me a sec... I think I need to go to the hospital. Thanks, you guys. Gillman's out of her office today. I told her to take a day off, and she did, can you believe it? Did you get someone to cover your class? Aren't you giving an exam? I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody. Wait, here's my guy... Hey! About my blood work? Sounds delightful. This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal. A reaction to AZT...  He's upset, he's sorry. He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy? That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please? Shelby? It's me. Jamey's been beeping me, I... Okay, okay, calm down. Put Jamey on. Slow down, Jamey, for Christ's sake! I brought it in last night, around midnight. It's in my computer. K-R-O-one. Jamey, I don't have to mention, do I, that we're up against a statute of limitations on this complaint which runs out in...  Seventy-five minutes. You go down to Word Processing and tell those motherfuckers they better come up with that complaint, now! Or they are fucking dead! You tell them that comes from me! Every problem has a solution. Every problem... has... a... solution. Every problem has a solution... You're not going to like this. Please try to smile... Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and... (pulling back, putting on his jacket) I will be back. An hour, tops. You're not smiling. One hour! I promise! Call the messenger service, have someone standing by...  Your phone. Think. You brought the discs in, you transferred... Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution. Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look. No. No, goddammit! Bob? Something's come up. With Kronos. I don't want to upset Charles, but...  Oh, shit, Bob, the complaint's due in forty minutes and I can't find it.  No, you don't have to come...  Great. Fucking great. I don't know what to do, Bob. Bob... What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint? Sorry... K-R-O-one. You're right, I probably just misfiled... Yeah, Walter. Yeah. Some sort of major problem. Thank you. I have AIDS. It's okay. Can I sit down?  New baby? Congratulations. Kids are great. I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners. Correct. I'm seeking representation. I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine? Nine. I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it. My lover and I. Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years. I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started... First on my leg. Then my forearm, my back. Then... my face. For a short period, I avoided the office during the day, waiting for the chemo therapy to clear up the lesions... But I never let anything slide. I made all my calls from home. I worked sixteen hour days on a complaint for a 350 million dollar copyright infringement suit. But the day the complaint was due, it disappeared. Erased from my computer. I thought I was losing it, mentally... That can happen, it's called AIDS dementia when it gets into your brain. But miraculously, a copy of the complaint was located at the last minute, and we got it to court on time... The next morning, I was called to the office for a meeting with the managing partners. Walking down that corridor was strange. Felt like everyone was staring. Makeup. The partners were waiting for me in the main conference room. Of course. I know that, Charles. Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done. There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.  Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time... Really? Who thinks that, sir? I had no idea there was a concern in that area. Hey:  I'll get to work on it right away. Honesty is always best. Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired? Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles. If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit? A carrot?! As in, the vegetable? Uh huh... Okay... I see... Who are you? The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position... Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today. They sabotaged me. Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons... Thanks for your time.  Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet. Thank you. I'm fine, thanks.  No. But would it make you more comfortable? Fine. What? I'm a lawyer. How's your baby? What's her name? Rayisha. Very nice.  One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead. Good point. The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS. No. They didn't fire her. Thank you.  Arline decision. Supreme Court. ""Subsequent decisions have held that AIDS is protected as a handicap under law, not only because of the physical limitations it imposes..."" ""But because the prejudice surrounding AIDS exacts a social death which precedes the actual, physical one..."" I can heal myself. I can heal myself. Jerk... What did you say? You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you? Fine, thanks, Charles. I want to go back to work, Your Honor.  Any settlement agreement must include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work. I was the one who was sabotaged.  You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor. I think I catch your subtle drift, Walter. This is the house where I grew up. In Downington, Pennsylvania.  See this... ? Those are my cute little hand prints. And my brother's and my sister's. Today is my parents' fortieth wedding anniversary. This is the front door. I caught a finger in this door, once...  This one. Broke it.  This is the hallway, my mother calls it a foyer...  This is my niece, Alexis. Say hello, Alexis.  You heard it here first, folks. News as it happens. This is my sister, Jill, the most fertile woman on the planet. She's married to Reverend Jim. And what will we find in... da duh da duh da duh... the KITCHEN! Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary? Where's Dad? Things might be said, at the trial, that... are not going to be easy for you to hear. Things about me, about my private life. And I want to make sure it's okay with everybody. What do you think, Jill? Mom? Thanks, Mom... Dad?  Thanks, Dad. I love you guys. How about you, Randy? I guess... I don't have time for that any more. I'm not political. I just want compensation for being fired. ""I don't see how that's any of your business...  But yes, I am.""  Very good.  We'll have to flush it again. I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment. I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment. Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway. What's wrong with you? I'm not going to close the-- ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!  You don't think there's much time left, do you? You're scared. You think we're near the end. Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? ""Begin to prepare for the inevitable."" What's that mean?! I'm not going to die. You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims? I'm not ready to die. I am so scared. I am so fucking, incredibly, fucking scared... You know, there's only one thing to do.  We have to have a party. PARRTYY! It's me, you dork. Glad to finally meet you. Come on in.  I have to introduce you to the can of soup. You can enter the costume contest together as a lunch special. This is Lisa Miller. Miguel Alvarez. I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great. Not bad. Let's find you a drink. What do you want? Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you? No, we have to do it. But later, allright? Correct. Thank you. Congratulations, Miller. You survived your first gay party intact. Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.  Uh huh... Charles. Okay. Miller? Do you... pray? What have you prayed for?  There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial. What happens? I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area... Thanks.  Do you like opera? Want to hear my favorite aria?  Andrea Chenier, by Giordano. This is Madeleine. She's telling how, during the French revolution, a mob set fire to her house. Her mother died, saving her. ""It was during that sorrow that love came to me! ""I am Oblivion! I am Glory! I am Love, Love, Love!"" Right.  I'll look over the Q and A. Wyant Wheeler had aggressively recruited me. They were the most prestigious firm in Philadelphia, full of opportunity. And I was impressed by the partners. Particularly, Charles. He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be. Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit. It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later. No. I was thirty pounds heavier. I was athletic. I suppose you could say that. I still am. No. I didn't. You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to have a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club... I'm seeing him this afternoon. ""Somebody started telling jokes."" Relieved. That I'd never told him I was gay. Very relieved. I'm an excellent lawyer. I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do. Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens. Something like that. In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to. Not unnecessary ones.  A few times. Gay movies. Yes. Yes. Yes. Once. Andrew. Now what do we do? I guess it was 1984, 85. It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV. That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex. I'd heard of something. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you. No. That is not correct. I never lied about it. No. Some do. I didn't. In some situations. Yes. Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread. Yes. That's right. Absolutely. One. Here, in front of my ear. By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger... No. I can't really see it. Yes sir. Yes. On my torso. Allright. Yes. Could you call an ambulance, please? What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean? A good start. Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.  Sure thing.  Thanks for coming by.  I'm okay, bro. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm ready... Whatever."
unbreakable,DAVID ,Bruce Willis," Someone left these. You want one? You like sports? What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation. But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit. You represent someone in Philadelphia? Not really. I'm David Dunne. How long are you staying in Philly? Great. What are you talking about? I think you got the wrong idea. Okay. Fine. Against a window. Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers? No. No. Yes... Why are you looking at me like that? I don't think I got the job in New York. I'm still going to New York. Just not this second. I know. How about in the meantime, you don't sleep in the guestroom anymore?  You sleep in our room. I'll sleep down here. Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom? I think it's be better if I was alone. How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here? I used to play football in college. In my first year as quarterback, we went on this winning streak. It just went on and on. It didn't matter who we played... I'd always win.  You get superstitious when something like that happens. You give things meaning. Like you wear the same color socks each game or you listen to the same B.B. King song before you leave the apartment. I wouldn't even untie the shoelaces on my cleats. I'd just slip them on and off so nothing would change... I gave things meaning that had no meaning.  I'm here to make sure I'm not making shoelaces into something they're not again.  I was the only person to survive that accident. The only one... It feels like it means something. Okay. What do you mean? The metal of the watch I was wearing was crushed like a sledge hammer hit it. Is Noel in? Oh. Wow. That's a sad story.  Do you think you could ask Noel something for me? Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here? Yes. You know what I think about to calm down? I think about those big fat, hundred and twenty pound turtles that live in the islands. Those suckers never get angry, never get in fights and live longer than all of us and all they do all is sit on the beach and hump other turtles.  Why don't we take a second and think about the turtles? Hey Noel. What? He's asleep. I wanted to ask you a question. It'll sound strange, but just think about it for a second. When's the last time I was sick? You remember? I haven't been sick this year. I know that. Do you remember me getting sick? Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick? In the three years we've been in this house?... In the old apartment?... Before Jeremy was born?... Before we were married? That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means? Yes. No that's it. Yeah. I know. When was the last time I wore pink? Oh shit... Goodnight Megan. I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so. Seventy-five percent. Skeptical about what? In college. A car accident. You assumed wrong. I think you skipped a couple steps. You forgot the ""Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on"" step. See usually that comes before the, ""It's over"" Step. And it always, always comes before the ""You can go"" Step.  What is over? What was your idea Elijah? Jeremy don't take another sip of that drink. Throw it in the trashcan near the door and wait for me outside. Do it now please. At the church... You were following me weren't you? What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment? I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.' Did you know that this morning was the first morning I can remember, that I didn't open my eyes and feel that sadness... Do you know what I'm talking about? That little bit of sadness?  I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me. For why I survived that train. For why my life feels so out of balance...  But I guess that's what you were counting on. I'm going to leave now.  Good luck with your sale. I work at the stadium as a security guard. Hi. Oh. What's he look like? Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there. Hold up Jenkins... It's for last week's game. What do you want? We're not proceeding anywhere together. One more time. What is it you want? Are you for real? I got this job because my college coach called the guy who manages the stadium. There's no hidden meaning to it. They need me at the gate. Did you really want to see the game? I can get you in. It gets heaviest ten minutes before kickoff. Why don't we pat down? Just give me a minute. That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line. I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on. Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show. I thought he was carrying something. I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v. Like what? Yes. I don't know what you're asking? Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at- Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore. The guy might not have been carrying anything. I have to go now. Quick. Yes. My wife Megan. She was in the car with me. Have a good life Elijah and try to buy your tickets at an authorized sales location. You know how mad your mom would be if she knew you were playing football? In under six seconds.  I've heard. I'm going to go in. Why'd you do that? Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things. I'm going to work out. There's nothing to do. Why don't you rest now? I'll take it from here. You've been a big help. No. No. No. How much did you put on there? You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds. That's the most I've ever lifted.  That could have been dangerous Jeremy. Why don't you go upstairs and let me finish up? No. No Jeremy. No. How much did you take off? You added? Two hundred and seventy. Okay. Why don't you move back a bit? Just to be safe. You should never try anything like this. You know that right? What do you do if something happens? How many did you put on that time? There's no more left? What else can we use? About three hundred and forty. Yeah, hello. Megan? Yeah? Megan where are you calling from? I remember you. Yeah it might be nice. ...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of? What do I do when I'm around someone I know? Hello. David. Okay. Thank you. His room? I see. That's great. Know what? Jeremy. There are big guys in almost every gym who can lift that much. Four ten... four forty-five...  Five hundred. We've had some problems with drug selling in this stadium.  Would you mind if I checked the pockets of your sweatshirt? Yeah? When? Megan handles that type of stuff. Jeremy's stuff. So do I need to put any smelly ointments on him or anything? What was that? Yes I am. You are like me. We both can get hurt. I'm just an ordinary man.  I'm not what you think I am. He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself. Would you like to try going- -out again. But if we see another mother from Jeremy's school, me name is Juan. I always wanted to be a Juan. Jesus. Jeremy what the hell are you doing? -Jeremy did you load that gun? -Elijah was wrong. -You know the story about the kid who almost drowned in the pool? -That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me. -I'm not. I just didn't connect it. -Jeremy listen to what- -Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York. You're right... If you shoot me, that bullet is going to bounce off me and I won't get hurt... but then I'm going to go upstairs and pack. And then leave to New York. Jeremy! You're about to get into big trouble! I'm your father and I'm telling you to put that gun down right now God damn it!  One!...  Two!... I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color. Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right. You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it. No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do. I don't want to see you again okay.  Now I'm finished. But I put cologne on. ...I think rust. As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood? My turn. What's your favorite song? What was that? Soft and Wet. That's very interesting. That's not the game. I'm not sure. What about the game? I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count? Yes. I don't know Megan. I know. Who called through? Megan... Megan? Me too. I think her leg is fractured. My shoulder's hurt. Elijah? What am I supposed to do? You need to leave now. Where is he? It's over now.  Your children are fine. They're getting help. I'm going to go now. I had a bad dream. He doesn't look very threatening. Are you Elijah's mother? It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne. We are. He's doing well today. He's kind of a miracle."
frankenstein,VICTOR ,Kenneth Branagh,"  I'm... dying. Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.  How is it you come to be here? Ah. An explorer. I heard. Creature? A... human like creature? Your men are right to be afraid. You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew? Do you share my madness? We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.  My name is Frankenstein... Don't cry, Elizabeth. We'll build a fort. So the lightning can't get us. Nothing can. Not ever. Mrs. Moritz. Mother? As a boy, I stood at this window and watched God destroy our tree. Father? How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her? What kind of God is He to will this? God took her from us. Our brother. The world is a dizzying place. He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so? Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz! Devil take walking, ladies! My brother shall learn to waltz! But never your equal. Quite a send-off, isn't it? And you? I'll have to do better than that. To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear... I'm not mad. I've loved you all my life This feels... incestuous. I wish to be your husband. Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now. Only you. You make me weak. Your decision. For us.  ...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join. Elizabeth. My more than sister. I'll make you so proud, Mother. We never finished our dance.  Someday we shall. The others will look to you while I'm gone, Willie. Be strong. Elizabeth. This will do nicely.  But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works. Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one. Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa... Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva. Very well then.  I am not mad. Are you having me on? Victor, Victor Frankenstein. Do you really think I'm mad? I'm afraid I rejected his application. He merely dabbles. Rich old ladies and their daughters? Quite a few. That's no excuse for being a pompous ass! You're a comfort to me, Henry.  It's a letter to my father. Professor Waldman. Krempe has a way of provoking my temper. To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new. No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known. These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions. Preposterous. It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this! But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views! I doubt that decision is still mine to make. Why? ...and I further wish to extend my sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe for my display. My behavior toward him was both rash and inexcusable. Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system? ...and the medulla oblongata is the transition between the spinal cord and the two parts I've already named... cerebrum and cerebellum. Any freshmen feeling queasy yet?  All of you, from the look of it. We'll resume your torture tomorrow. Despite the lack of challenge. The strain was evident. What keeps me going are my friends. Only you would think of that! I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.  Nothing in moderation, Clerval. He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance. Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap. It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die. Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death! I resent God's monopoly. Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!  No. He had more important work. Life and death.  Why should You alone have the final say? To understand the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death... and examine the process in minutest detail... No longer pathetic and useless I've been preoccupied. That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory. Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now. Materials. That's all they are Tissue to be re-used. That one. Not optimal. Must use. No time to replace. Body can't wait. This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want? Yes? And? You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye. Time running out. Rate of decay accelerating. Must strike now... or start again from scratch.  Live, you bastard! It's alive. It's alive. What have I done? LET GO OF ME! Massive birth defects. Result is malfunctional and vile.  Have chosen to abort. Stay away!  No... no... I'm not dead... please... Don't put me on the cart! I'm not dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD! A... week? Is that your diagnosis? You've been going round-the-clock?  Everything in moderation, Clerval.  No. They don't. I want to go home. It can't survive. ""...but it's been so long since I've heard from you. Remember the vow we took the night you left? You must be honest with me if your feelings have changed. Answer for the sake of our friendship, and both our future happiness.""  She wrote that four months ago. Thank you, Professor. For everything. Take me home, my friend. There! Look! Thank you, Henry. This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere. Elizabeth?  We'll organize another search now that it's light enough. We'll find her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise. Who is it? Yes. Did you?  Did you, Justine? I always viewed her with brotherly affection. I had no idea of her feelings for me. But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved? It's hard to believe. Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO! Oh God. Justine. Forgive me. My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come. I've no choice They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend. I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass. WHERE ARE YOU? You speak. How did you find me? Kill me and have done with it. Then why am I here? What did you want with me? Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother. How dare you. You're disgusting and evil. I see it before me. There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand. Materials. Nothing more. Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.  I don't know. What can I do? Friend? Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking. And if I consent? Yes. I want this over and done with. I'm all right. I'm safe, I didn't find what I was looking for. At shadows. My nerves got the better of me. It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday. So do I. A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done. You must regain your strength to preside at our wedding... and spoil your grandchildren later on. These are duties you cannot shirk. We're all safe now. I promise God forgive me. Why... her? My words. The brain stem was destroyed by the hanging. We'll need another. The body looks like it will do, but some extremities are too decayed. They'll have to be replaced. The fresher the better. What is this? This was not taken from a grave. No. I draw the line.  I will not! Kill me now! No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today. It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes? We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.  Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay. I do. But you must trust me for now. Be especially on your guard. Stay cautious to a fault. He is huge and deformed... and quite insane. Are you sure you'll be all right? I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.  I owe you that. Done. Damn it Make sure you keep your pistols dry Now husband and wife. I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then. Open this door for no-one! Elizabeth. ELIZABETH!  Oh God... he took her heart... he took her heart from me... Live. Say my name. Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you remember. Say my name. You must. You must. Say my name. Say you remember. Yes. I'll help you remember. ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three. She's not for you. Elizabeth, no!  Say my name. SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS! NO! You killed her! You killed her! All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand. You should have been my father's son. He would have been so proud. A year now I've followed him. Perhaps more. Only to arrive at this place. Tired. So very tired. I never did find... whatever it was... I was looking for... and neither will you, my friend.  Value life above ambition... or those glittering prizes you seek will crumble to dust in your fingers... as they have in mine.  See your loved ones again. I cannot."
friday_the_13th,ALICE ,Adrienne King," Cabin B is ready. You told her to sweep the courts. You can changed in three. Steve said for you to start on the boats. I'll tell him. Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen.  Annie. I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve. Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more time at it. Just a feeling.  Nothing personal. I don't know.  Probably be best for everybody. Next Friday. Sure. How come? Did you want something? Un-hunh.  Oh, my God... It's long and personal.  It has nothing to do with you or the other kids. And it's this place.  It makes no sense, but it spooks me. Artist. What'd you see? I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife. I don't know. I'll be along. I didn't know I was asleep...What time is it? Now I'm only eleven hours behind schedule.  Steve is going to have a small cow. And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes--like you don't care about children...  I'll see you later. You're very nice. Help!  There's a fucking snake in here. How the... did he get in there? Okay.  Can I help? The way I feel, that's perfect. Bad bulb or no power.  It's getting a little gloomy in here. Tomorrow is another day. This just plain ain't my day. Somebody probably dropped something too hard. Ned?  We're gonna be working together for a while.  You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay? Sure. You're welcome. He went to bed early. Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched. I'm not always this stupid. It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon.  It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them. Well, it hasn't been that long. I think we should go wake them up.  Just in case. I guess... Good night, Brenda. Absolutely. I don't here it anymore. It sounded like Brenda. Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field? They're off now. Okay.  I'll go with you. Brenda?  Brenda?  You there? Bill.  What the fuck is going on here? Marcie? Marcie?  Brenda?  Jack?  I think we should call the police, Bill. Do you have a dime?  A quarter? Hello?  Hello?  This damn thing's dead, too. What's the matter with it? Why don't we run?  Just run now? Bill?!  The generator... Bill?  Bill? Bill! Bill?  Help!  Help! Jack!  Marcie!  Help me! The knife! He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God... Jack?  Marcie?  Ned? No, no, they're all dead... They'll kill you!  Don't leave me! All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie... Bill--Bill--Bill is out there... The killer is still out there. Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy. I don't understand.  Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy? Mr. Christy will be back soon. I won't let you!  No!  No!  No! Where are the goddamned bullets? Please... Help me."
solaris,KELVIN ,George Clooney," Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on approach, do you read me?  Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on approach, do you read me? Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? I'm Kelvin. What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian? How? What? What happened here? Where's Sartorius?  He'll let me in. Let me in. All right. What happened to Gibarian? I want to hear your version. I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him? Where's his body? Her?  Who are you talking about? They shouldn't let people like you into space. Listen -- Is there anybody else here? Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message. She was real.  Where did she come from? Tell me.  I won't think you're insane. Where did she come from? How much sleep? That depends. The Prometheus, as far as I can tell, is functionally intact.  Crew status: One dead, Gibarian.  Cause of death appears to be suicide. Interviews with the surviving members and a perusal of the deceased's personal effects indicate he was suffering from severe depression with psychotic features, along with bouts of hypomania, dementia, delirium, and primary insomnia.  All of these symptoms, combined with a profound sense of isolation, are commonly found in studies of low stimulation environments, particularly long range space travel.  Snow and Sartorius show indications of depression, including dysthymic and bipolar I; a variety of stress disorders, including acute and posttraumatic; and suggestions of agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive disorder, and hypersomnia.  I emphasize these are preliminary opinions on my part.  I will attempt to convince Snow and Sartorius to return to Earth, but as they currently view me as an intruder of sorts, this may take some time. Oh, God.  I'm awake. Where did you come from? How are you here? Yes. I need to see Snow.  I'll just be a minute. Why? I'll be right back. All right.  All right.  Here. To calm your anxiety. Yes. Go ahead.  I'll close the door behind me. Shut up. What was it? And professionally? My wife. Rheya. Will she come back? I wish you'd told me. To who? I don't know. Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed. Rheya... ""And Death Shall Have No Dominion"". Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train. You didn't look very happy. And tonight? That's good to know. Stop it. Rheya.  Not here. Let's go home. I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here. You're better when you take them. All right.  How about I feel better when you take them? What do you remember? Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends? Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe.  An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive. We had to unlearn everything. Intelligent beyond our comprehension. It's something. The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates! You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything? As I said, it is beyond our comprehension. What is it? Why? All right? Rheya... You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why? Yes. This is my wife, Rheya. Go ahead. No.  There's no behavior modification. Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.  When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt? Where've you been? How old were you? What kind of look? I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that. I did too. I used to watch you undress. I never tired of watching you undress.  Every time, it was exciting.  Right until... to the end. You don't know? I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me. When you said you wouldn't make it... I didn't believe you.  Or I didn't take you seriously, which is worse. I should have believed you. It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires. -- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating. Not necessarily. Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody. I think so. How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible. Like I said, it's not possible. I know.  I'm putting that in my next report. Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home. Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God. He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven. It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice. Yes.  Yes. Everything you pursue, you end up becoming disinterested in.  The fact that you're good at everything you try makes it worse.  You have a degree in animal science, you could be a terrific vet. You drifted into writing and turned out to be a perceptive journalist. Then it was politics, which seemed best of all, you had an actual gift for understanding the best pattern for a group of people to be arranged for you to achieve your goal.  And they didn't even know they were being arranged.  But you got bored with it, like you do with everything. I don't know what it's really like, to not know what you want to do. To not have anything that you love to do more than anything else. What's wrong. Stop. What are you talking about? Who have you been talking to? When?  When I'm asleep? I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are. Yes.  Especially toward the end. You... she said I didn't love her. No.  I love you. Can you sleep? Those are dreams. Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants? That's fantastic. Don't debate him; he'll say anything. Get out of here. No. I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now? But why is it doing what it's doing?  Given it's resources, it could have done anything. Presented me with your double, and you with mine. Human beings can die. They come when you sleep. Rheya. For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now. Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before.  It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us. Not this time. Do you? Gibarian. What do you want? Can it work? I can trust Rheya. You're not Gibarian... A puppet. Gibarian.  He was here. He is.  But he was here... He spoke to me. Are you going to take them? It's all right. I love you. That won't happen again.  We're different. I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching. She drank liquid oxygen. She's dead. Get out -- Rheya -- Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here. You are her, you are Rheya. No. Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you. I want every second I can get with you. We'll know soon enough. That's good to know. You should have told me. Thank you. Neither did I. I never said I didn't. I can't stay here. Then you won't make it. I came back.  You have to know that.  I came back that night. I couldn't make it, either.  I'm so sorry. I want you here. You exist here.  I keep telling you. Who are you, then? Yes, you are -- Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine. Is that really what you want? I wish you wouldn't. I think they help. You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters -- It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me. I don't know anymore.  All I see is you. Stay with me.  Stay with me. She knows everything.  She knows who she is. No. I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan. Just get him to stop. Yes. Her oxygen would have run out. Into what? I love her. A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours? What does it want? Please.  Don't. I though I was home. I thought it was over. Where did you go before? Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor. What's the matter? Rheya? I'm losing my mind.  I'm breaking apart. Is this what it means to die?  Am I in the moment of my own death?  Is this the last thought I will ever have? I am home now.  I try to find the rhythm of the world where I used to live... but I feel completely and continually out of-sync.  I am separate.  Why did I return to Earth and lie about what happened?  Lie about having contact with something like Solaris?  I knew something else was out there, and didn't tell a soul.  I left them in the dark.  We all did. So why come back at all?  To see if she comes here? I don't believe it will happen. But I will wait, anyway. I thought it was over. ""Though they go mad they shall be sane.  Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again."" You killed her! You murdered her! She'll come back. Why would you let her to do that? You fucking bastard... How quickly? Where's Snow?  Did you call him?  Snow!  We need you up here. Snow! What's wrong with you?  We need your help. When did this happen? Jesus... Maybe you can. Earth.  What did that word mean to me?  I have returned.  Finally. I work in the city now.  After work I wander and lose myself.  I am silent and attentive.  I follow the current.  I make a conscious effort to smile, nod, stand, and perform the millions of gestures that constitute life on Earth. I will study these gestures until they become reflexes again.  I will find new interests and occupations, but -- I will not... give myself.  I will not give myself to anything or anyone, because I am haunted by the idea that I remembered her wrong. That I shaded my memory of her to suit myself.  That I was unfair to her and caused her destruction. What if I was wrong about everything?  I've come to believe that memory is a curse. How can you be here... I love you."
swingers,MIKE ,Jon Favreau," And what if I don't want to give up on her? But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her. So I don't call either way. So what's the difference? So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her. Well that sucks. So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her. Right...  Wait, what do you mean? Unless she comes back first. There's the rub. Thanks, man.  Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time... ...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps. Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.  Shit.  I know, I know. You're right.  I know. I don't know about that. It didn't feel that way. Okay.  I'll think about that.  Bye.  Enough.  I've got to use the phone. No.  Stop, come on. S'up Trent? Shuddup. I don't know... Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight.  I got shit to do tomorrow... I don't know... We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about.  But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck.  I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to.  And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack.  Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes.  I'm not gonna be one of those assholes.  It's fucking depressing.  Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me?  It makes me want to puke. What are you talking about?  Vegas? What Vegas? When? You're crazy. I'm not going to Vegas. I can't lose more than a hundred. Wait. What are you wearing?  I mean, we should wear suits. No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit. Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.  I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one.  I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night.  You gotta be cool though. I'm serious.  This is how you do it.  I'm telling you. Vegas!  You think we'll get there by midnight? Vegas! Vegas! Vegas.  Whu?  Vegas.  Pirates of the fucking Caribbean. This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland. This place is dead.  I thought this was the city that never sleeps. They're all skanks. Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six.  This is the skank shift. Cut that shit out. That's not cool. It doesn't matter... You're gonna screw up our plan. First let's see what happens if we play it cool. Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around. The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.  That's where we make our scene. Oh, they're watching all right.  They're watching. I don't know, I guess I'll start with three hundred in, uh, blacks. Sorry? Uh, I don't want to bet it all.  Oh... right. Huh? Sure, that'll be fine. Do you have anything smaller?  No.  Blacks will be fine.  What?!? I know, but... ...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money... I know.  Double down. Yeah?  Well obviously not always! I'm just saying, not in this particular case. But I lost!  How can you say always?!?  I'm gonna fuckinkillyou. Thanks for clarifying that. Yea, how much? Don't give me that shit.  You know exactly how much you lost.  What'd you drop? You won.  There's nothing to be sorry about.  You're a winner.  I'm the fuckin loser.  I should be sorry. Let's just leave. Let's go.  What an asshole. Sorry.  We got knocked out pretty quickly. Could you believe it? Nah, I didn't really want it anyway.  I just wanted to order it. No thanks.  Why ruin a perfect night. What an asshole. That was so demeaning... I can't believe what an asshole you are. She was smiling at what an asshole you are. Let's go.  I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it. What are you, nuts?  You think she's coming back? I don't think so. You think so? I'm too tired for this.  Let's just go. She likes you. I don't know... That's bullshit. It's just that I've been out of the game so long.  Trent, I was with her for six years.  That's before AIDS.  I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know... It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy... ... and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to... That was so fuckin' money.  It was like that ""Jedi mind"" shit. I know.  I know. Coffee...  Two coffees.  It says ""Breakfast Any Time"", right? I'll have ""pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment"". I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.  ""Age of Enlightenment"".  Shit.  Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference.  How demeaning. I may as well have just said ""Let me jump your ignorant bones.""... ... It's just, I thought ""Renaissance"" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though... I hope so.  We gotta go soon. We didn't do so bad after all. Excuse me.  We're in a bit of a hurry. I'm Mike...  and this is my friend ""Doubledown Trent"". Whatever. Well... we're not in Kansas anymore. I'm a comedian. No... Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy... There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...  Oh?  You know about booking agents...  I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet... Actually, it's funny you...  I'm actually, uh, between... What was the part? ""Big Brother"", ""Little Brother""? No! No!  Not the camera guy! ... So give me the fuckin part... I believe it. I know, but she did.  She's with someone else now... Why not? We were a rebound, and we lasted six years. Six years. Can I check my messages?  I have a calling card. Sorry, it's just that... Trent...  Tee. Sorry, man, I need... No, man.  I need to use the phone. I gotta use the phone. Please, Tee.  I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.  I hope I'm not interrupting anything. They weren't in there that long.  I've got a calling card, there's no charge to your phone. She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done?  Lie? Sorry about interrupting... Christy was nice... She was hot. I don't know.  The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on.  Does that makes me some kind of fag? She didn't like me, anyway. I don't think so. Yeah, a good friend. I just don't think she liked me in that way. Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you. That was different. I was younger... It was college.  You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like.  You screw chicks you have no business being with.  They're young, they don't know any better. I just need some time... Don't remind me. ... a day... Selling scrap metal. He drives a carriage.  I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something. I hear she's getting real fat. I'm gonna try.  I'm really gonna try. I's a gig. You're an actor.  Find the Zen in the role. Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town. What do you want?  You're tall. You tested over a month ago.  I'm sure they figured it out by now. Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today? Why? What?  Like, you didn't want to jinx it? I don't talk about her that much. I didn't mention her once today. The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore.  I thought you'd appreciate that. I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead.  Play it out. I'm not making any more excuses for myself. You want to hit the town tonight? What do you have?  A Pluto call back? Count 'em up. I don't know.  Eight or Nine. What'd you get? Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole.  This is turning into quite a rivalry. Hey Sue.  Gretsky's on his ass again. You should play another team.  The Kings are bitches in this game. Give it up, Sue. This version doesn't have fighting? What?  That was the best part of the old game. No. Make someone bleed. Give me the money.  I'll get it. You guys are such assholes. What time's this party tonight? So, what?  Eleven? I'm gonna bring and old friend who just moved out here. Yeah.  You met him once. He's trying to be an actor. To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.  It's one of these.  For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.  It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing.  It's kinda cool.  It's like you're in on some kind of secret.  You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it.  The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there.  You have to have someone come before.  There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons.  It's kinda like Judaism... ... That's probably a more appropriate analogy. Kinda money, huh? I'll get a Dewars rocks... ...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please. I know.  It's like the opposite of inbreeding.  The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool. I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it. Wait till summer.  I swear, you can't leave the house.  It hurts.  It physically hurts. Ah, there's the rub... Charles!  What's up, man? Did you, um, did you get that pilot? ... piece of shit.  Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East. Charles and me went to network on this pilot together. ... yeah, a month ago. ... and boy does it hurt when they ask. ... not until you book it... ... you might get cut out. You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont?  They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies. ... the Copa, in New York... ... Maybe.  I mean you gotta hide all the lights... ... How can you compare them?  Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...  Well, let's hit that party. Who threw this party, anyway? Sue.  His dad was big Johnny Cash fan. ... ""A Boy Named Sue"".  I think that's why he's such a bad cat. He's a mean dude.  I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb.  He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man.  He's a nice guy though. There are so many beautiful women here. I got to at least try once. No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try.  I gotta get out there sooner or later.  I'm going in.  Will you be my wing-man? Good evening, ladies... How are you ladies doing this evening? I'm sorry? Oh... a Cavalier. ... It's red? How you guys doing? Which one? The one in the hat?  She's cute. What? She didn't notice. I'm sorry. Not well. I don't know.  It was kind of a dick move if you ask me. You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up. That doesn't matter. I can't believe you. What else is going on? God bless you guys.  I can't even get this guy to notice me... You like laughing at the misery of others? I'll have a Dewars on the rocks. Thanks. You ever go to the Kelbo's?  On Pico? ... Monday nights?  I host an open mike... Yeah.  Well, you know, it's tough.  A lot of traveling.  A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good.  I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas... Are you sure?  Maybe...  Oh, yeah...  Boy, that must've been a while ago. BLONDE I'd say about two weeks. Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.  Oh...  Sorry.  Well, thank you...? Thank you, Nikki. What a surprise. She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself... Please, don't mess with me right now... You're not just, like, fucking with me? How long do I wait to call? Tomorrow? So, two days?  Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number... Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked.  How's that, Tee?  Is that ""the money""? How long are you guys gonna wait to call your honeys? What an asshole.  Didn't you see ""Boys in the Hood""?  Now one of us is gonna get shot. You asshole. You asshole.  Why are you carrying a gun? What?  In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg? Yeah.  Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day.  Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you.  Out here you gotta go look for it... You live in such a fantasy world... ... It was six months, and she didn't dump... No, Trent.  He's right. Shut up. Hi, Nikki.  This is Mike.  I met you tonight at the Dresden.  I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call.  So call me tomorrow, or , like, in two days, whatever.  My number is 213-555-4679... Hi, Nikki.  This is Mike, again.  I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine.  Anyway, my number is... 213-555-4679.  That's all.  I just wanted to leave my number.  I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something... (he regrets saying it immediately) ... I mean, you know, we should just hang out.  That's it.  No expectations. Just, you know,  hang out.  Bye. I just got out of a six-year relationship.  Okay?  That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird.  It's not you.  It's me.  I just wanted to say that.  Sorry.  This is Mike. Hi, Nikki.  This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in?  I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... Hi, Nikki.  Mike.  I don't think this is working out.  I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other.  It's not you, really. It's me.  It's only been six months... Nikki!  Great!  Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along? Wow, I guess you were home... Thanks, man. No.  Just O.J. Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea... What's the point? Uuuuugh! I'm such an asshole. I think I'm gonna move Back East. What's dumb about it? How am I doing well?  I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians.  How good am I doing? They turned you down? I didn't make it...  Then why won't she call...? How did you get over it?  I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting? You miss the pain? Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?  You always know the right thing to say. What are they doing here? Don't sweat it, man.  I needed a kick in the ass.  We're better friends for it. Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down!  What time are we leaving? Hi. I'm Mike. Like the quiche? I like quiche. My reputation seems to have preceded me. Not lately. Just like that? How was it hard? Tell me about it... Yeah. It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.  It does. Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single. What what?  What advantages?  Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you. What else...?  Let's see...  You have complete freedom. I don't know.... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want. Anything. Uh, if the guy wants to. Yes.  I mean, no.  I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive.  Maybe he doesn't like to dance.  Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...  No... Maybe that's not the case.  Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to... Sure I will. Listen.  I had a great time. I would love to see you again sometime. That's not good enough.  I want to make plans to see you. Yeah.  And an actor. If and when I get a real gig I'll call you. When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport.  I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan. ... Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into... Why, you like the duck with the cigar? Good eye.  Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card. ... It's really getting late. ... Nah.  I'm right across the street... ... The red piece of shit over there... ... get the hell outta here already... I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight.  That Lorraine chick is good. It's not like that... I know she liked me.  I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight. She's really special, guys. Guys... Guys... I got it under control. You guys are such assholes. Hello? Michelle? ... Six months. Fine... I guess.  You? Yeah? What kind of things? I thought you met someone else. Really? Why didn't you call? ... the Micheline commercial... Pierre... That's his name?  Pierre?  Is he French? Hang on.  Let me get rid of this call. Hello? Lorraine? Yeah, hold on. No, no.  Hold on. Hi. Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon...  Listen, can I call you right back?  I gotta take this call... I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call.  They're holding.  I'll talk with you when you get back in town.  Bye. Hi.  Sorry about that. That's okay.  I wanted to talk to you.  Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off? Hi, Lorraine.  Thanks for holding on."
next,CRIS ,Nicolas Cage," And ""we"" is...? Just the check. It's a joke, but it's true. The future changes every time you look at it. Because you looked at it. Cause once you see it, you're different. Maybe just a little. And that changes everything else. It's got something to do with quantum physics. I've got other rules, too. I don't play against people, like at poker. Only against the house. And my goal isn't to win big. At least not any more. The idea is to go unnoticed so I can keep coming back to the trough. So no jackpots. No longshots. No big bets except when I want `em to see me lose. Try that one, man. I've got a feeling. Against my religion. Do it, quick, before somebody else gets there. Mainly I stick to blackjack. Boring but controllable. And safe unless they think you're counting. Grand Dad, rocks. Scuse me, sorry. Most of the time, I'm not paying attention. Just making sure I don't step in a mess. Sometimes I get a blast from far away. Or I can start with a glimpse of something close and keep pushing on. Usually it's none of my business. Guy around? Tell him it's King Midas. I need to cash some chips. - Got tagged. I've been trying to lay low.  He was gonna kill you! You all would'a died! That was the night Donna broke off our engagement. I was so drunk I could barely see now. Christ, Guy, did you have to? Well, you can save your breath. Cause I know what you're gonna say. I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm done playing the market. Except last time, Neal didn't take ""finito"" for an answer. I can stay ahead of `em forever. Because I don't want to be used any more. Cause what I want is freedom. And you don't get it by giving it up. Enjoy it while it lasts. Looking for this? Don't mess with somebody who knows your moves before you even think 'em. Don't wait for me. I came to fix you dinner. Sometimes not knowing is better. If I tell `em the truth, you know what happens? I end up with the Feds. - And you know what they do to me? It's not funny, Irv. That's all I do, day after day, for the rest of my life. Watch the news until I lose my hair and croak. The best I can do is stay away from all of `em. I know, I know, but there's something I gotta do first. She's coming here. The Fed. Let's play it out. I've got the place all picked out. It's called Palau. Three hundred teeny islands in the South Pacific.  Nothing ever happens there, so there's nothing to foresee. Her. I haven't met her yet. It has to be her. She's the mother of my child. I guess the doctors were wrong. He's got my thing. My thing. Agent Ferris, come in. Let's go in the kitchen. I've got a roast in the oven. Yeah, people say I could have been a chef. Everyone but you, of course. Trust me, it's better if I don't. It's better if I just mind my own business. Nobody's grabbed me yet. I know, I know, I've got the place picked out. But there's something I've gotta do first. I have to go. I know, but they're coming for me. This is for nurses and stuff, to make things a little easier. I looked, Irv, I really did. I went down every path, every treatment. Sometimes there's just no... Mind if I join you? Is that cruller any good? Shopping for a car? Rough day? I'm so sorry. I'm a spaz. Why would I do that? Look, I'm sorry. If I could, I'd do it over. Here. Well, Liz, your luck's about to change. You met me. An angel, actually. And we always reward the people who help us. You don't have to do anything. But I could use a ride. It already has. Not even a tingle? Then you're way overdue. For a reversal of fortune. Any kids? I mean of your own. I guess that's good. Considering. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. He didn't want to adopt? It already has.  Take this exit. Quick! Just take it! No it's not! Traffic was piling up. You didn't see it? We could'a been stuck there for hours. You're right. I'm sorry. I panicked. I get phobic sitting in traffic. It won't happen again, I promise. How `bout at the next gas station? Please. I'll fill up your tank. I am really really really really sorry. But lately I've been traveling all around Oregon. It's really peaceful up there.  Exactly. Well, thanks for the ride. You're welcome. I understand...Well, see ya. Sierra Pale. Just a friend. Easy, man. Easy, man. No ho'pital. I don' nee' ho'pital. I'm sorry I'm causing you all this trouble. Actually, I wasn't standing for that long. Why didn't you? What a terrible quality. You're too loyal. Once you start watching, it's hard not to get involved. Almost. She wanted kids. It's just that...I can't. I don't know. You asked and...I guess I felt like you'd understand. That was incredible. This. You said it was broken.  I - I didn't think of it. - I thought you'd be happy to see me. Do you want me to leave these somewhere? All right then. I'll just go. I've got a better idea. Run away with me to the South Pacific. But we're going to be happy together for the rest of our lives. Really, I peeked. Deadly. Let's go pack your bags. We'll leave tonight. Don't worry. That's always been easy for me. Why? They'll replace you. They can pick up the slack. I - I don't think it's okay. I'm not that kind of person. But I have this feeling, this very strong feeling, that it has to be now. We have to leave soon, or it's not gonna work out. Yes, but sometimes you have to make it happen. You have to seize the opportunity before it's too late. Your students are very lucky. But then you have to sign the divorce papers. I said I'll pay. No need for that. I'll give you cash. Okay? Will you take cash? Okay, three. What do you want me to do? Wait for people to die? Look, there's something I've been wanting to tell you. It does. It's not religious. I just happen to see my life before it happens. Flip it. Just do it. Heads. Flip it again.  Tails. Tails.  Heads.  Tails. Now you believe me? Liz.  Don't you see? I can get us all the money we need. Why? Because I care so much about kids that sometimes I overreact? Believe me, the feeling is mutual. What do you mean? You want to talk to my doctor? I'll get him on the phone. No, really, I mean it. I'll have him send you my records. Because I want you to trust me. All the time. - But mainly how to stay out of trouble. There's only one thing I've ever wanted. A family. Well, I was, as they say, left on a doorstep when I was two.  Never found foster parents who could put up with me. - So to me, a family sounds like plenty. I wish. God, this is gorgeous. What's wrong? You mean, do I believe a higher power brought us together? No. I think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang. Oh, but it is. Think of it: For us to meet, everything from the very beginning, every sub-atomic event, every galactic cataclysm, every step of evolution, every act, every accident, every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and I could be together, right here and now. To whatever happens next.  Why? Late? I do now. I have no idea. Unless...But that still doesn't explain... Liz, I really did have this problem. I wasn't lying to you. But this is good. This is amazing. I want this baby more than anything. For both of us. You lying bitch! You betrayed me!  Liz, please, I love you. Let me talk to you for one minute. I won't hurt you, I promise. The man I killed was there to rob the store. He was going to panic and shoot five innocent people. Because I saw them die. Yes. Not ""might""! Those people died! - They just hadn't died yet. Once. That's why I don't go out much. So I won't be there to see. If they catch me, they'll put me in a cell without a trial, and they'll never let me out. They do that, you know. There's one decent path.  But if we're gonna stay on it, I need you to do exactly what I say. Will you give me one chance? One chance in exchange for a miracle? A few steps on, your robe will get caught on a thornbush. You won't be able to get unstuck. Ferris and a tough guy will come help you. She'll say, ""You've done your country a great service."" Be unpredictable. Surprise works to my advantage. - And read this when you're safe. Bet on it. Believe me now? Where were you going? I'll check on our ride. Right now I'm just trying to stay alive. Just the opposite. I never take chances. Did the doctors ever say why you couldn't have kids? What's that? Except you're not. And neither am I. We're different, that's all. We just had to find the right match. Oh shit. Oh no. I blew it. GET OUT! NOW! OR YOU'LL DIE! Why does everybody have amnesia but me? Don't let them know you're pregnant. I'll get us out of here. We can still make the plane. ""From now on, Cris, the bullets are real."" I'm going. No need for a hotfoot. Why? I know what happens. You tie me down and never let me out. Because you're trying to force me. I don't believe you. Don't get too attached to your arms and legs.  He hasn't got the balls. I'd say you have way too much. Give me your keys.  If I see you, I'll kill her. ""We got off on the wrong foot."" ""all been a big misunderstanding."" ""We've never meant you any harm."" I guess you're a better liar than I am. It'll never happen. When are they going to give up? After you're dead? To a gang of murderers? What's about to happen...you've brought it on yourselves. I'm planning on it. Get out! I guess... They didn't explain. They were trying to force me. Liz? Where are you going? But I have conditions. Liz... I can't. - I have to go. There's something I have to do. Something you'd want me to do. And I can't put it off any longer. Liz, it's not like that. I searched for you for a long time. I want to be with you forever. But a lot has happened since then. We're going to have a child. I don't expect you to believe me. But when you do find out, remember that we came together for a reason. That this wasn't just...one night. It was a special chance for both of us. I'm not...I'm taking the long way around. And I looked for a happy ending... But this was the best I could do. I wouldn't be surprised. I wasn't ready till now. ""The future ain't what it used to be."" Ever hear that expression? It's a joke, but it's true. The future changes every time you look at it. Because you looked at it. Cause once you see it, you're different. And that changes everything else."
dune,PAUL ,Kyle MacLachlan,"  Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond...  ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis.  It does look dry.... Where are the Harkonnens from here?  There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen... the enemy.  I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back to the door. I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall. I'd know the difference. My father sent you to test me. Music then? Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood. I'm sorry Gurney.  What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.  Is this what you seek? Would you really have drawn my blood? Things have been so serious here lately. Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis? DR. YUEH I have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen... only 125 meters long. Only?! The storms and the worms. Is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour? Well, how do the Fremen survive there?  The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways?  The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke! I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going? The bull that killed my grandfather... is this an evil omen?  Duncan! Why?  I wish you were coming with us. May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.  Father. I want you to be proud of me. Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet...Arrakis... Desert Planet... moving... moving. Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.  Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet... moving... moving. Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father... nothing?  What does she fear?  What about my Father?  She's using The Voice.  No. What's in the box?  The Voice again. Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?  It burns.  I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.  THE PAIN! I see the truth of it. REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth? I know it. Not all of them... I know which ones will. What is it? Where? I have heard of it. REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried... Did they try and fail? I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't! Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die! MOTHER! Tell me!  Far off in the control rooms.... Travelling without moving.  Spice...  Terrible purpose.... What is it? A Fremen... Could she be the operator? No...  A traitor...  There is a traitor among us. Are you a Fremen?  He's hiding something. ""Your gift is a blessing of the river."" No. No one. It... seemed the proper way. Will we see a worm? Always? Why do they come?  Spice!... pure un-refined spice!  Liet?  Father!... father... drugged... 122. INT. BARON'S QUARTERS - HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT  Duncan!!  Duncan!!  Don't touch my mother...  Remove her gag! I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock. The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock... Hurry!  Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm.  Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...  The second moon... from the dreams...  House Atreides is ruined.  This moon holds my past. This moon holds my future. 139E.     INT. WATER - NIGHT I am only a seed... Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... JESSICA Calm yourself/ The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it. You carry my unborn sister in your womb! You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...  Father... now I have become a killer and I will continue to kill until I have avenged your death.  Father!  Yueh's left the plans for the weirding modules. We have to get to that mountain of rock. We have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our lives... It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.  Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper. Keep going... Faster!! JESSICA  It's deafening!  Run! Drum sand!  Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?  I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.  A thumper.  Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.  Yes...  From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet.... is this Kynes' daughter?  What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon? Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib? Wind traps... huge ones.  Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.  I am only a seed.  I am Usul... Paul Muad'dib. CROWDS  Muad'dib!  No one ever dreamed there would be so many.  Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more than this.  We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild and the entire universe depends on spice. The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit secret.  With my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it. PAUL Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my father's armies were never able to fully develop this new form.  This is what I will teach you.  You will be the fiercest and most feared fighters in the Universe. Move back! Chuksa!  To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.  The most lethal poison in the Universe. Did they try and fail?  What if she should fail?  She did it! Chani....  I love you... I've always loved you.... 204. through 209. Activate your weirding modules... Set the range for two meters. Korba...  The arm... Motion... Chuuk-sa...  My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well? Now! Stilgar signals, and Fremen run behind them.  When the spice flow stops, the entire Universe will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.  Only the very strong ones travel this deep....  A sandrider!...  Long live the fighters! We surprised a band of smugglers. Gurney!... You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck. Don't you trust your own eyes. Hurry!  All I see is darkness.  Now... the test of the water of life... what is it that waits for me in this darkness? Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED. Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.  Your time has come.  Father... our time has come.  A storm is coming -- our storm... and when it comes it will shake the Universe. Emperor... we come for you.  Long live the fighters! Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the atomics.  I want an opening through the entire Shield Wall.  Stilgar?  Do we have wormsign?  Alia keeps pace with the storm. Gurney and Stilgar don't understand.  Suddenly enormous dust clouds and LIGHTNING sweep up over the Shield Wall. Gurney, now! Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free. Let him stand free!  A knife....  In payment of the many years of service to my family, you may know ask of me anything you wish.  Anything at all.  Do you need my life, old friend?  It is yours. I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to strike, do it now.  Carry this noble Atreides warrior away. Do him all honor. Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM BACK!  Good.  You have some idea of what I would do but I will tell it to one who has never been seen... one who hides deep in the Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it first. Where are you....  Let me see you or there will be no spice. We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING. Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator. You know what I'm about to say is true.... I have the power to destroy the spice forever. Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours. You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.  SILENCE! I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine.  I can kill with a word. A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the prophecy.  There is a Harkonnen among you.  Give the Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth. The Emperor's blade. Now, I will tell you how it will be. Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.  The Princess shall have no more of me than my name... no child of mine or touch the softness of glance... nor instant of desire....  This is my promise to you...  ...my love. The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib. They will have their Holy War to cleanse the Universe... they will have Arrakis... Dune... their planet.  There will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases.  For the spice there will always be some desert.  There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. We Fremen have a saying...  ""God created Arrakis to train the faithful."" One cannot go against the word of God."
beginners,OLIVER ,Ewan McGregor," Yeah yeah. You're coming to live with me now. Arthur looks at him. This is my car. Arthur hops in. This is the dining room where people come and eat sometimes. The dog listens intently. Oliver moves on, the dog follows. This is the living room. That's the bathroom. The dog looks. This is 2003. This is what the sun looks like, and the stars, nature. This is the President. And this is the sun in 1955, and the stars, and nature, and cars, and phones, and movies, and the President. These are what pets looked like. These are fireworks. This was smoking. This is what it looked like when people kissed... ...When they were happy... ...When they were sad. My parents got married in 1955. He was a museum director - she fixed up old houses. They had a child, and they stayed married for 44 years... ...Until she died in their bed, after four months of cancer and eating French toast for every meal and watching the Teletubbies everyday and confusing white straws for her cigarettes and skipping back and forth through time inside her head. Six months later, my father told me he was gay. He had just turned 75. I always remember him wearing a purple sweater when he told me this but actually he wore a robe. He changed all his clothes. He got a boyfriend, Andy, a physical trainer who was also studying for his professional pyrotechnic license. Camera lands on Hal beaming with pride, his arm around Andy who looks into camera and says. He found an out gay priest to guide him spiritually. He saw a therapist for the first time. He joined the Primetimers. Movie night. Los Angeles Pride, and then... Four years after he came out, he died in this room... Look, its lonely out here, so you'd better learn how to talk with me. Arthur's face looks up at him filled with a dog's love and no words. I know. I know. Calm. Calm, calm breaths. Hal coughs. Pop, Pop, stop -- you're gonna hurt yourself. A NURSE quickly enters and helps hold down his arms. No, Pop. She's a great nurse in the hospital, we don't really know her, you're very high on drugs. No, Pop, I just don't want to be like you and mom.  Thank you... Go have your own experiences with your own people. I'll be right here... Arthur stays by Oliver's side. I'm a human. I'm not a dog. And you're a Jack Russell, that's a breed. Your personality was created by this guy John Russell, a hunting enthusiast, in the 1800s. And he bred your ancestors to have stamina and courage for the hunt. You think you're just you, and you want to chase the foxes, but other people planted that in you years ago. Now, somewhat arbitrarily, you are considered very cute by us humans, and we keep breeding you not to chase foxes, but to be cute, and we put you in movies and television shows, and you, you're chasing tennis balls cause there as close to a fox as you're going to get. Arthur stays by Oliver's side. Want me to read this? I found it in your books. Nice. Oh, Andy brought those for you. Well, I don't know. Its just a painting on the wall. Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's curiosity, he lands on some photos displayed on the table. They're just photos, Pop. They're just personal photos. They're not art. Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors, sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile ceiling. Hal points up. Oliver looks for a beat, then... Uh, well that's the water sprinkler thing. What is? Jesus, Liz. Another band that wants portraits. You do something decent once, and that's all people ever want. JUMP CUT through the different portraits developing. It's not what Oliver want's to do. Yeah? Arthur, you haven't been invited to this party. You're gonna stay and look after the house. Oliver tentatively shuts the door, takes three steps, Arthur begins to howl. Oliver tries to ignore it, but stops again. He looks back at the house and the howling. His name's Arthur - he doesn't do tricks. In the background are a couple dressed as JULIAN and ETHEL ROSENBERG, we see them observe Oliver and Arthur.  Does it make you feel powerful to order my dog around? Maybe give you a sense of power? Thanks, yeah. Very good. Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The Rosenberg's are still watching. Yeah.  I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh... for this week. Thank you for coming in. The witch moves on. Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this joviality. We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching him. Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down onto the couch, ready for her session. Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a break, actually. She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious. Oliver can tell she's not going to give it up.  Well, I guess we should start with your mother. The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver: ""Never had one."" Well then your father. She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying. I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis? She writes on her pad: ""I have laryngitis"" That's a physical problem. She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes: ""Why are you at a party if you're sad?"" CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation. I was doing such a good job of hiding it. How could you tell? Ethel holds up her notebook. She has drawn TWO EYES. Oliver's taken by her. Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink. You? She smiles and nods. You, stay here, yeah? Oliver moves to-- Watch him OK? Oliver begins to leave his drinks. We see his POV of the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg waiting on the couch. Oliver slips into one of his memories... Hello? Yeah. You did? Probably house music? So did you meet anyone? At the packed bar, Hal drinks alone. Would you like to dance? She happily nods yes. They walk to the dance floor, we think Oliver's going to be shy, but he breaks into a kinetic, angular, dance. She's surprised with us - she laughs, they have a good time. Hello... Shes mouths a silent ""hi""... Can I give you my number? She pulls out her pad and pen and hands them to him. Thanks. As he writes, Oliver spies Arthur sitting in the corner of the bathroom, staring directly at him. I feel bad dragging Arthur to the party. I should get home. It was really nice meeting you. She writes on her pad: ""Au Revoir"" Hello? ON THE OTHER END: Silence. A little breathing, the party in background. Is that you? One beep means yes? I've always wanted to have a phone call with someone who doesn't talk... You want to do something? Now? Okay, I'm parked just right up the street. BEEP. They hang up. Oliver is filled with hope. CUT TO: ""Julius"" walking out into a pool of street light. They smile at each other, but don't say anything. They get into his car. Okay. You point - I'll drive. Oliver starts the engine. She points forward and they head off. At the light she points left, he follows. Down the street she points right... This way? Nice place. They sit on her bed. She steals his pipe, put's it in her mouth -- writes on her pad and shows it to him. Oh, my mother. My mother died five years ago. Oh, you spoke. My father died two months ago, almost three. She looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise. Oliver's opened up, an now everything gushes out, he barely knows what he's saying. He, he was gay. She's very surprised. He was gay the whole time they were married. He came out after my mother died and, uh... he was 75 years old. There's a quiet moment of deep connection. Sorry. She mouths ""No"" . She reaches out and gently runs a finger across Oliver's brow and the outline of his face, he's so vulnerable, she lovingly/mischievously squishes his face together and messes up his hair. Then she leans in, and they kiss for the first time - delicately. Sure, sure. They lay down, she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning her. He pulls the covers over them. Oliver. She writes again: ""Go to NY. Audition. Back Thursday."" How long are you here when you get back? Anna holds up one finger. A year? Anna shakes her head and smiles. She gestures smaller. A month? Right. And then?... She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting. You're filming here. Acting. And after?... She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand. Just somewhere else. Where? Anna only shrugs. She writes more, and tosses the notepad on his lap. Oliver reads: ""Can I see you again?"" He's very happy. Yes. Hello house,  hello Oliver. Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail. Oliver slows and stares at his father's magazine - The Advocate. Two attractive, shirtless men on the cover under the title: America's Sweethearts. Oliver's lost in memory... I'm sorry. Andy? The Brazilian ballet star is already known not only as a skilled partner, but also as a gifted and versatile dancer, who adeptly fields roles ranging... Camera tracks out of the room, leaving the two men alone... Yeah, he's fine. He sleeps on your bed. Yeah, yeah, he's eating. What was all that? I'm sorry. Moans and complaints from the group. What did you do with my father? He was so polite. Two, four, six, eight... I'm gonna meet her at her hotel again. You happy?  Here's eight... Turns to Elliot. We haven't actually had a conversation yet, so, you know... And you know that because? It's true. It's embarrassing. I'm 38 and falling for a girl again... It's like I lost the instructions or I, I never had them... Young Oliver walks up to Georgia. I don't feel like screaming... Georgia, never ruffled. What the fuck is that? Well, that's ridiculous. Well, its just copying something someone did, like, 30 years ago in the Bronx. How does it work? Historical consciousness... you know, something bigger than myself. Elliott scoffs. Let's do it again. Elliott drives off. Oliver's coming to life. Maybe we, we could, um, just talk for a second. This music's old. I'm Jewish right? Georgia comes and sits with him, caresses his hair as she talks with him. C'mon. Still embarrassed, Oliver takes Georgia's hand and walks her away from the guard. No. Camisole? Anna laughs. I was brought up by these animals and they didn't like questions. They're both smiling now. They were very frowned upon. So I had to guess. Anna takes this in. Anything? CUT TO: Oliver and Anna at the window. What's out there? She points. Yeah. Uh-huh. Right. How do you know so much about people? Oh yeah? She points at her blank face. No, that's not true. Yeah, you have blonde hair that goes down to about here. You smoke in non-smoking rooms. Oliver is still covering her eyes, leading her to a certain point, the busy sound of the freeway fading up... Okay, open your eyes... HIGH ANGLE on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath Oliver and Anna's feet under the overpass. The trucks lay on their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them. MOMENTS LATER: they walk alongside the LA river together, arm in arm, happy. The intimate conversation continues in voice over. Yeah, you see, you don't know me at all. Someone flashy walks into your life and you're just gonna fall for it? No, uh, it doesn't work like that. There are other steps, it's complicated. They look at each other a beat and then walk on together. You know... I don't know. She was great. My situation? That's your fatherly advice? Personal ads? What? Jesus, Pop. I thought he was your boyfriend? Pop. Alright, come on. Come on. Oliver tries to clear the couch of books and dogs for Hal to sit down. Arthur, down. I'd wait for the lion. Oliver grabs the oxygen tubes and puts them on Hal's face. Hey, what did you get? She puts the cover of Liv Ullman's ""Changing"" over her face - Ullman's face on the cover becomes Anna's. Liv Ullman. Very serious. That's kind of a classic American thing. Anna opens the book to a large drawing of a couple having sex. Yeah, Like page 75? Or 75 all the way through, through Veronica Lake. She was a pin-up model and a film star... Success was short-lived... series of broken marriages... She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism. She died of hepatitis at the age of 53. Yeah. It's really good. JUMP CUT: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously, we're not sure what she thinks. What do you think? It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd like it. You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel. Anna can barely swallow her huge bite... How do you keep hold of friends... or boyfriends? You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people. She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine. Yeah, I guess so. The look to each other. Pop? What are you--? Pop. What? Prednisone makes you crazy. Pop, you should rest. Hal looks sick but energized, he shuffles his desk of papers. Nothing, you're pretty. Yeah. You're kidding right? She did not. Anna laughs. As Anna continues to explain, the sound begins to fade down... This is what it looks like when Anna tells me about being Jewish in 2003. And when I tell her that my mother was Jewish. And then my father turned in his gay badge when my mother turned in her Jewish badge. And they got married in My mother didn't know she was Jewish until she was 13. It was 1938. This is what people looked like. And lions and giraffes. This man was Man of the Year. Her father tried to hide that they were Jewish. This is the swim team that asked her to leave once they discovered that she was Jewish. This is what pretty looked like in My father realized he was gay when he was 13. It was 1938. This is what pretty looked like. This is the only place my father could hide and have sex in the Fifties. My father said if you got caught my the Vice Squad you could lose everything... This is everything. My father laid down on a couch like this and told the psychiatrist all his problems in 1955. The doctor told him that homosexuality was a mental illness, but it could be cured. Not everyone got cured. This is where my parents lived in And this is the home where the first gay rights group was secretly meeting. While they were reciting their vows, here in this church... Allen Ginsburg was writing his famous poem, Howl, blocks away in this room. Yeah. Right. Here, Pop. I know, I know. Come on. Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his glass with a teaspoon as he swallows. The room is cluttered with books. Oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a paper-filled side table. Alright. Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a chair. But what about this chair? Is it gay? Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that far. Pop, you just got out of the hospital, you should take it easy. You need to tell Andy that you're... not well. Hal, continues on, avoiding looking at Oliver. Me? Hey. Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he stops his workout. Oliver tries to find his words. Yeah? Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys. No. I don't know Andy. Okay, okay. I couldn't tell him. No it's not. You can't hide this from him. He loves you. Just act natural. When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it, okay? He's that bad? She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up the line next to him. Oui? Anna continues to talk in a different voice. Oui Papa. Doing what? You should tell mom about that, not me. She just looks at him. Back into phone. Just as it was going so well. Hey Anna? How do you feel about vandalism? It's the last question she thought he'd ask. She's amused. You okay? Okay. Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard. Yeah. He comes to her, wanting to get beyond the romance somehow. I'm trying to impress you. Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry. We see the old man's face, it's not Hal, but it the resemblance hits Oliver too. The man is struggling with his hotel key card. Uh, do you mind? Oliver swipes the man's key, the door opens. Yeah. She wants to take care of him, she lays him back on the bed, helps him take his coat off, she's sitting on him, caressing him - Oliver is overwhelmed by memory. Somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick. He did a lot of shopping. Bought all these books. And new clothes. He was obsessed with Staples. He bought a lot of plants. He had a lot of parties. I thought I was making dinner? He had these political letter writing parties, there was an out gay congressman he was supporting... He started telling everyone that he was getting better. They're finally almost alone. Why're you telling them you're ""turning the corner""? You have stage 4 cancer? Pop. There is no stage 5. What does it mean? What movie are we watching? Yeah I know who Harvey Milk is. He hired a secretary that he could dictate to. He wrote an essay about religion... You re-wrote Jesus' death? They all laugh. For the first time I saw him really in love. Oliver waves back at his father. Anna? If this is too much, then we should just stop. Oliver gets up and starts to leave, Anna's surprised. She catches up with him puts her arms around him from behind. No! He talks to you too? Your English is not so perfect. And he said ten minutes. You okay?  You did really well. You watching all the humans going around and around. The manager of the rink suddenly arrives, upset. If I leave him on his own, he loses all control. Yeah, but if I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls. I can't leave him in the car. She is just talking in French. She's saying it's OK, it is such a small dog. You're gonna call the authorities? Sorry, excuse us, sorry. They enter Anna's door. He shouldn't do this to you. The phone in the next room keeps ringing. He awkwardly skates to it and unplugs it. He returns. Your leaving soon? I think you should come to my house and move in with me. Yeah, a lot. She's very moved. Yes . She laughs. She almost cries as she thinks this over. She skates to him, puts her arms around him. But now I'm going to have to kill you for sure now. Cause I'm falling in love with you. The sound in the room fades down, Oliver's narration fades in over the shot of them embracing in their skates. Anna and I are in a relationship in This is what the sun looks like and the stars. This is what it looks like when we eat. When we tell each other the stories in our heads. I was born in 1965. Anna was born in 1971. This is what the sun looked like. Her pets. Her parents. She left home when she was 16. She lived here and here and here. She had three serious relationships. She left all of them. I had four serious relationships. I left them too. Or let them fall apart. We didn't know how we learned the stories in our heads but sometimes they stop running and I can really see Anna's eyes in 2003. Her ears. Her feet. This is what it looks like when she says, I love you, in This is what it looks like when she cries. When she tells me there's always a new empty room waiting for her. They used to make her feel free. Now they make her feel the opposite of free. Next one. Yeah, everyone knows that, here. He gives Hal another pill, another reluctant difficult swallow, another ping. Everyone knows about that Pop. No, I just thought you and mom weren't in love. But you were gay that whole time. For 44 years? What about sex? You guys had sex? And mom? You wanted mom too right? Frustrated and angry, Oliver takes the pill tray into the kitchen, leaving Hal behind. Sex. Life. Healing. Sunlight. Spirit. The first Gay Pride flag was made in 1978 by a man named Gilbert Baker. He gave a meaning to each color. This man was President. This was invented, this is what movies looked like. Pets. On November 27th, 1978. Harvey Milk was shot and killed. One week later, my father opened his annual Museum Christmas Exhibit. He collected stuffed animals from people in the community, and put them on display. My father printed a quote from The Velveteen Rabbit in large type on the wall... ...`The stuffed rabbit asked - What is real? And the Horse said, ""Real isn't how you're made. It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long long time not just to play with, but really loves then you become real... ...'It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen to people who break easily... ...Generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints. But these things don't matter at all because you are real and you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.'"" The music blares as Arthur greets Oliver. Hal comes to Oliver, Andy continues to dance. Yeah? Is that a good idea? Hal hugs Oliver. This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness. Oliver spreads out an impossible long CD panel design. Here, this could be your... The panels go on and on. Your gonna need a big CD box. JUMP CUT: Later, Oliver's still trying to talk the band into his idea. Four billion years ago, Earth begins. And the idea is that sadness has not been created yet. JUMP CUT: Oliver and the RECORD COMPANY REP now alone. I'm sorry. Well, that went well. Come on Arthur. This is the living room. He leads her into the dining room. Dining room. Oliver points to a photo of his parents when they were in their 50's. There are my parents. My mom. Hal, Georgia, this is Anna - Anna - Hal, Georgia. Anna's overwhelmed feeling increases, she continues to try to roll with it. These're the stairs. They go up. I emptied these for you. I'll get your case. Are you okay? She want's to be, she hides it all by initiating sex with him, physical and fast. Are you? Why were you crying yesterday? They're miles apart. Yeah. Well are you happy here? I don't know Anna. I don't think this is what I am supposed to feel like. Anna looks crushed and surprised. I can barely remember you from when I was little. Let's go home. CUT TO: Oliver and Georgia heading away through the gallery. Let's go. Oliver pulls her away before she starts any more trouble. Anna? Where where you? Hey. Okay? Thanks. Elliott closes the door. Oliver heads back to his car and Arthur's howling begins. It's an incredibly sad and desperate howl. Oliver gets to his car, the howling doesn't stop, Oliver can't ignore it. Oliver get's out of the car, heads back to house to get Arthur. Hey. Look I'm so sorry... But I'm, I'm at your front door. I'm in New York. Anna, still in bed, sits up and feels something. You, you're in LA? Anna laughs, but is touched. You said you were coming here?! Fuck. I'm in your building. Anna laughs. Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like nothing here. Maybe because I, I don't really believe that it's gonna work. And then I make sure it doesn't work. Great. You look great. Once you make the call, you have less than an hour before two men come and place the body into a bag. You will need to make copies and send them to cancel every credit card, phone account, utility, gym membership, every insurance policy, mortgage, to settle their taxes. You will have all their mail forwarded to your address. You will write their obituary. You run it with a photo in the paper for two dollars a word. You will wonder if it's right. You'll throw a lot of their stuff away. You'll bring a lot of their stuff to your house. This is the photo my mother kept in her bedroom. When I was a kid I thought that was my arm giving her daisies. Now I make a new mistake and think it's her arm giving me the daisies, saying, here, here's simple and happy. That's what I meant to give you. Hey. Arthur... Oliver picks him up, he gets all of Arthur's stuff, he's a little cold to Andy. Thank you... Thanks. What? No. No, it's because my father loved you so much. This hits Andy hard. Oliver turns to leave but can't. He turns back, goes to Andy and they hug. Arthur... hey. Hey, how've you been? Hey. She's a bit tentative, but she's here and happy. Come in, come in. Arthur runs up and Anna bends down to greet him. They missed each other. Anna walks in and Oliver follows. Yeah. Sure. Chest... I like giving and getting rubdowns and then going into mutual soft stuff. They both smile. What happens now? How does that work? They look at each other, they smile."
42,RICKEY ,Harrison Ford," Gentlemen, I have a plan... As of now, only the Board of Directors and my family know. My wife says I'm too old, That my health isn't up to it. My son says that every one in baseball will be against me. But I'm going to do it. I'm going to bring a Negro ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers. There's no law against it, Clyde. So be it. New York is full of Negro baseball fans; every dollar is green. I don't know who he is, or where he is, but he's coming. No. A heck of a player. But too sweet, they'll eat him alive. Too old. We need a man with a future not a past. (holds up his own  A four sport college man, out of UCLA. That means he's played with white boys. For refusing to sit in the back of a military bus.  Ft. Hood, Texas. The driver asked him to move back. The MPs had to take him off. I see he resents segregation. If he were white, we'd call it spirit! Robinson's a Methodist. I'm a Methodist. God's a Methodist. We can't go wrong. Find him. Bring him here. Do you have a girl? A man needs a family relying on him. It insures he'll behave responsibly. Do you have a girl? You think so? Jack looks to Sukeforth who smiles placidly. Back to Rickey. Do you love her? Rachel? Marry her. What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance. Baseball's a hard life; a man needs a good woman by his side. You don't want the only person waiting for you at home to be a catcher. Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him. This is about baseball. Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal. I see you starting in the spring with our affiliate in Montreal. If you make it there, we'll try you down here with the Dodgers. The white Brooklyn Dodgers. Jack looks to Sukeforth who nods: Yes, you heard right. I'll pay you $600 a month and a $3,500 bonus when you sign the contract. Is that agreeable? Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming. There is one condition. I have a pile of scouting reports. I know you can hit behind the runner, that you can read a pitch. The question is can you control your temper? Yes your temper! Are you deaf?! Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there, fists now balled. Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there: He looks proud. Willful. I want to win! I want ballplayers who can win! Are you one of them?! A black man in white baseball. Imagine the reaction. The vitriol. Rickey strides forward, gets in his face. The Dodgers check into a hotel. A decent good hotel. You're worn out from the road and some clerk won't give you the pen to sign in. The team stops at a restaurant. The waiter won't take your order.  Didn't you see the sign on the door? No animals allowed. I want one who has the guts not to fight back! There are people who will not like this. They will do anything to get you to react. If you echo a curse with a curse, they will only hear yours. Follow a blow with a blow and they will say a Negro lost his temper; that the Negro does not belong. Your enemy will be out in force, but you can not meet him on his own low ground. We win with hitting, running and fielding, nothing else. We win if the world is convinced of two things: that you are a fine gentlemen and a great ballplayer. Like our Savior, you must have the guts to turn the other cheek. Jack considers Rickey. Rickey looks worn out. Can you do it? Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon. He crosses. Who's the best shortstop you ever saw? Rabbit Tavener? And you call yourself a sports writer? Pop Lloyd. Wagner is number two. And Rabbit Tavener would not break my top 25. Where do you suppose Jackie Robinson will end up on that list? Alright then, where would he rate at second? High praise. He'll have to be the best in the minor leagues first. I'm saying it's going to be a very interesting spring training. A lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over, we can train down in Florida again. Those towns may as well be a million miles from Daytona. I spoke to the Daytona mayor. He assures me there'll be no trouble. But Rickey doesn't sound so sure. They consider each other. Mr. Smith, are you a Communist? I have a business proposition. What's your salary at the Courier? I will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with Jackie Robinson. You will watch over him, help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn. You will act as his chauffeur, you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be, help him find restaurants, etc... Unprecedented access for any reportage you feel appropriate. What do you say, Mr. Smith? Ebbets Field actually, but yes, I agree. The world is ready. How are they looking, Leo? A bus? Harold, how in blazes did he end up on a bus?! BOB BRAGAN, in his catching gear, passing by with pitchers RALPH BRANCA and KIRBY HIGBE. Higbe asides to Bragan: Listen to this, Harold. Whenever I hear a white man - yours truly - broadcasting what a Moses he is to the Negro race, then I know the latter needs a bodyguard. (Parrott tries to The minor league commissioner of baseball said that! I pay part of his salary! You wouldn't stab me in the back like this, would you? Why didn't you say so?! Clay, I'd like you to meet Jackie Robinson. Jackie, Clay Hopper, manager of the Montreal Royals. Hopper shakes his hand as they exchange greetings. I agree. And I'll state another obvious, Clay, I need the players to act like gentlemen around him. To treat him as they would any other teammate. To be natural, to impose no restrictions on themselves. To all work together in harmony. WHACK! The hit & run is on. The man on first runs on the pitch as a LOW LINE DRIVE shoots for the gap between 1st and 2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly and catch it before it hits the ground. He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner out before he can get back to first.   Rickey is astounded. That was superhuman. Clay, I realize that attitude is part of your heritage; that you practically nursed race prejudice at your mother's breast, so I will let it pass. But I will add this: you can manage Robinson fairly and correctly or you can be unemployed. They both look over as Jack comes off the field toward them. Yes, Wendell, what is it? I see... Yes, I understand. Wake him up and get him out of there. Put him in the car and start driving for Daytona Beach. Now. And, Wendell, under no circumstance tell him what this is about. I do not want him to get it in his head to stay there and fight. I've spoken to the mayor. I've explained how much money we'll spend in Daytona. But still, when this fine young Negro man steps on that field today, he and the Dodgers will technically be breaking the law. A law which says white and black players cannot enjoy the same field at the same time. Does that make sense to you? Does Jim Crow make any sense when placed against the words of the United States Constitution? When placed against the word of God? POP OUT to reveal he sits beside the DODGER BATBOY, so short his feet don't touch the ground. Rickey offers his peanut bag. As the batboy takes one... I'll tell you, it does not make sense to me. Watching from a seat behind third. Thataway, Jackie! Thataway! Bermuda grass grows so well here. I wish we could get it to grow like this in Brooklyn. Me, too. Rickey consider the field a moment, then Jack. Jackie, it's my pleasure to tell you that you've earned a spot on the Montreal Royals. When they head north Tuesday for opening day against Jersey City, you'll be on the train. Jack trying to hold down his excitement. I know that. Give her my regards. Jack about to head off when he looks back.. I'm an opportunist. With you and the Negro players I hope to bring up next year I'll put together a team that can win the World Series. And the World Series means money. Jack studies him a beat, not quite buying it. Don't you believe that? Agreed. Therefore, run the bases like the Devil himself. Worry those pitchers so they come apart. Sometimes they'll catch you, but don't worry about that. Ty Cobb got caught plenty. Just run as you see fit. Put the natural fear of God into them. Good evening. I have something very important to talk with you about tonight. Something that will require courage from all of us. I have a ballplayer on my Montreal team named Jackie Robinson. The start of applause. Rickey motions for it to stop. He may stay there or he may be brought to Brooklyn. But if Jackie does come up to the Dodgers, the biggest threat to his success, the one enemy most likely to ruin that success, is the Negro people themselves! There is shocked silence in the room. Rickey notices a group of KIDS watching from a raised running track, soldiers on: I say it as cruelly as I can to make you all realize the weight of responsibility that is not only on myself and the Dodgers, but on Negroes everywhere. For on the day Jackie enters the National League, if he does, I have no doubt every one of you will form parades and welcoming committees. You'll strut. You'll wear badges. You'll hold Jackie Robinson days and Jackie Robinson nights. You'll get drunk, fight and be arrested. This is too much. People are slackjawed. Rickey powers on. You'll wine and dine him until he is fat and futile. You'll symbolize his importance into a national comedy and yes, a tragedy! So let me tell you this!  If any group or segment of Negro society uses the advancement of Jackie Robinson in baseball as a triumph of race over race, I will regret the day I ever signed him to a contract, and I will personally see that baseball is never so abused and misrepresented again! Is he done? An embarrassed smattering of applause. Mostly shock and stares. As Rickey stands there uncomfortably... Thank you, Mr. Miller. I'm sorry; the spotlight will be on us all. Hello, Leo, what are you doing? Another spring training is upon us. In Panama. I need to know your attitude toward Jackie Robinson. Eight times in the Bible we're told to love our neighbor. It's one of God's most repeated commands. If by nice you mean soft, no, not particularly. So you have no objections to him? Yes. Oh -- and Leo? The Bible says a thing or two about adultery as well. Pipe dream? What do you mean by pipe dream? INSERT: Panama City, Panama. March 18, 1947. A team full of tough war veterans? Immigrants' sons? Boys from impoverished parts of the country? You really believe they won't accept him? Once they see how he plays, how he can help them win. Have our friends in the press gone to sleep yet? A deliberate violation of the law, needs a little show of force. I leave it to you. Good night, Leo. Bragan, most of your teammates have recanted on this petition nonsense. Are you really here to tell me you don't want to play with Robinson? And your friends here in Brooklyn?  Then I will accommodate you. If you give me your word that you will try your very best for this team until I can work out a trade. That gets Bragan's goat. He jumps up, really mad. Only on yourself apparently. You can go, Bragan. Send Dixie in. I received your letter, Dixie. I realize, Dixie, that you have a Southern upbringing, that you would have to subordinate your feelings for the welfare of this venture. I for one would deeply appreciate it. I think we can all learn something. Is that what you're you afraid of?  Bragan's a third-stringer, but you bat clean-up. You're popular in Brooklyn. Children look up to you! I'll start looking for a trade or a sale. But it won't happen until I get value in return. Until then I expect you to drive in runs. Branch Rickey cannot afford to upset team chemistry and so the only thing keeping Robinson off the Dodgers now, plainly, is the attitude of the players. INSERT: Brooklyn. April 9, 1947. If it softens at the sight of Jackie's skills, he'll join the club some time between April 10 and April 15. Otherwise, Robinson will spend the year back in Montreal.  For the love of Pete, he batted .625 in the exhibition games against them, us, them -- Against us! Judas Priest! Rickey flummoxed as the phone RINGS from the outer office. Durocher. Of course, he's my ace in the hole. Very good, Harold. The phone still rings. Rickey looks to his open door. Jane Ann! Are you out there? Grumbling, brambly eyebrows twitching, he makes the mistake of answering his own phone. Branch Rickey... You're speaking to him... The Commissioner of what..? Oh, yes put him on.  The commissioner of baseball. Fine. What can I do for you, Happy? I'm sorry, Happy, I thought you said lose Durocher for a year. Anyone who sets foot in Havana is seen with known gamblers. You're joking. Now I'm sure you're joking. Happy checks his nails, returns his hand to the MANICURIST. You know very well my organization is about to enter a tempest. I need Durocher at the rudder. He's the only man who can handle this much trouble, who loves it in fact. You're chopping off my right hand! You can't do that! Happy, you son of a bitch! DIAL TONE. Rickey steadies himself, looks to Parrott. Trouble ahead, Harold. Trouble. I'm so sorry about the rush. Events are unfolding too fast to keep up with. The burden has finally fallen to me and so be it. Yes, yes. As Jack poises the pen -- Rickey suddenly aghast. Stop! The pen a millimeter over the page. History. And I'm blabbing, blabbing through history... Rushing it along. What am I thinking? Jane Ann, come in here.  Harold! Parrott sticks his head out from an office down the hall. Get some employees up here! Harold, telegram the press. Say this: The Brooklyn Dodgers today purchased the contract of Jackie Robinson from the Montreal Royals. He will report immediately. As Jack takes it in, he's the only one not smiling. Opening day, Harold. The world is all future and no past. It's a game of inches, Jackie! Come in! Baseball has returned to Brooklyn, Burt. Another season is underway. Inevitable I suppose. I asked him if she was worth it and he said yes. How's the retirement? It's a helluva thing when a man has good health and enough money and absolutely nothing to do. Is that so? Roses and sleep are two wonderful things, Burt. But sleep you can get inside your casket and flowers look good on top of it. You don't look like a dead man to me. I need you to manage the Dodgers. We're a ship without a captain; there's a typhoon ahead. Do you miss the game, Burt? Look me in the eye and tell me you don't. Shotton considers Rickey a beat and then looks away. You promised her you wouldn't put on another uniform. You didn't promise her you wouldn't manage. Wear a suit and tie; Connie Mack still does. You remember what the peanuts smell like roasting, how the crack of the bat sounds, the roar of the crowd? My car's parked right out front. Harold will show you where. Now what do you say? What's he saying? Stands, watches. Praying this doesn't go south. As Jack finally continues on, Rickey closes his eyes in relief. You can't, Jackie. You know it. These men have to live with You don't matter right now, Jack. You're in this thing. You don't have the right to pull out from the backing of people who believe in you, respect you and who need you. If you fight, they won't say Chapman forced you to; they'll just say that you're over your head. That you belong where you are. That every downtrodden man who wants more from life is over his head. Jack's either going to explode or break into tears. No. You do. You're the one living the sermon. In the wilderness. Forty days. All of it. Only you. Of course there is! You can stand up and hit! You can get on base and you can score! You can win this game for us! We need you as well! Everyone needs you.  You're medicine, Jack. Rickey reaches out, touches the wall to stay standing. Jack just breathes as familiar sounds reverb down the tunnel. Who's playing first? Jack considers him. Everything hangs in the balance. Then: When I first told you about Jackie, you were against it. Now all of a sudden you're worrying about him. How do you suppose that happened? Sympathy, Harold, is a Greek word. It means to suffer. I sympathize with you means I suffer with you. This Philadelphia manager has done me a service. Is there an echo in here? Yes, he's creating sympathy on Jackie's behalf. Philadelphia by the way is Greek for brotherly love. The intercom BUZZES. What do you want, Bragan? What about Robinson? Bragan's been staring at the floor. He looks up now. The low afternoon sun hits his face. Why? Do you remember the story, Burt, of the 99 sheep? How one was missing? I find myself at odds. I want integration and the pennant. I want to punish Dixie and at the same time I want his salvation. It would be so much simpler if he wasn't batting .385. As Walker finishes, he passes Jack whose turn it is. Nevertheless it must be accepted calmly, Harold. What is it? A headline: PLAYERS STRIKE. Parrott reads... Madness! What are they thinking?! National League President Frick says this is America and baseball is America's game. He says one citizen has as much right to play as another. Because my job is to win. I have an obligation to Brooklyn to put the best team on the field I can. Your presence on the roster increases our chances of winning. Not buying it, Jack looks over at him. You look lovely, Mrs. Robinson. I don't know how you do it. Every day, from the 1st to the 9th. Myself? I could pay $100 for a suit and in twenty minutes I'd look like I fell out of bed. Even my shoes look rumpled. They watch Jack crack one high off the Schaefer Beer sign. Is that so? How did you two meet? Trying to catch her in a race. She was the fastest girl in town. Beautiful legs. I finally caught up; we've been together ever since. They sit a moment. Below: Jack nails another one. I wanted to apologize to you. Everything. I can't apologize to him. He and I both knew what we were getting into. But you. A newlywed, trying to blossom a marriage under all this pressure. Your husband has humbled me. When this all began I thought I was changing the world and that Jackie was my instrument. Can you imagine? I wish I could help him, but I'm just a spectator. Is he able to get things off his chest? So he doesn't burn up? Good. It's too much to carry inside. Does he have any friends on the team?  They're spectators, too. They do admire him though. Rachel looks out to where Reese and Stanky play catch. Even the worst of us recognizes courage. Moral courage especially. I have to think they see it. Jackie's a man on trial. He's responding with glory and grace. No one can take their eyes off him. I suppose we all are. You're an astute woman, Mrs. Robinson. If I'd met you first, I wouldn't have looked so long for Jackie. I mean if he was good enough for you, he's certainly good enough for the rest of us. What can I do for you, Herb? Twenty years. Maybe more. And why's that, Herb? His name's Jackie Robinson by the way. Herbert, what your team does is your decision. But my team is coming to Philadelphia. With Robinson. If we have to claim the game as a forfeit, we will. That's 9-0 in case you forgot. Do you think God likes baseball? I do. It means you're going to meet God one day, Herb, and when he inquires why Robinson wasn't on the field in Philadelphia and you answer because he was a Negro, it may not be a sufficient reply. As Rickey hangs up the phone... What can I do for you, Pee Wee? It's an important road trip, we're only three games out of first. Cincinnati's nearly a home game for you. Nigger lover. Watch yourself. We will get you, carpetbagger.  Typical stuff. Reese takes the letter back, a little hurt. How many of these letters have you gotten, Pee Wee? I'll tell you what they aren't, they aren't letters from the Jackie Robinson fan club. Here -- He thrusts a sheaf of it into Reese's hands. As Reese flips through the stack of hate, reads: Of course he knows. And the FBI. They're taking a threat in Cincinnati pretty seriously. So excuse me if I'm not too shocked at you being called a carpetbagger. You should be proud of it! I understand. I bet Jackie just wants to play ball. I bet he wishes he wasn't leading the league in hit by pitch. I bet he wishes people didn't want to kill him. But the world isn't so simple anymore. I'm not sure it ever was. We just, baseball ignored it. Now we can't. Coming up out of his seat along with the fans around him. Get out. Let me talk to my first baseman. Go. He's getting stitched up for Pete's sake. The reporters move off for other interviews. Reporter Two hesitant to let it go, finally drifts off. Rickey watches. Sticking up for yourself is what you'd expect of any man. Some find it galling to see it in a Negro. Sorry? Sorry for what? I told you, Jackie, all the best base runners get caught sometimes. Do you know what I saw this morning? I was passing a sandlot and a little white boy was up to bat. You know what he was doing? He was pretending he was you. Wiping his hands on his pants, swinging with his arms outstretched like you do. A little white boy pretending he was a black man. We had victory over fascism in Germany; it's time for victory over racism at home. I love this game. I love baseball. I've given my life to it. Forty odd years ago I was a player coach at Ohio Wesleyan University. We had a Negro catcher, best hitter on the team. Charley Thomas. Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands. A fine young man. I saw him laid low. Broken because of the color of his skin and I didn't do enough to help. I told myself I did, but I didn't. The game I loved had something unfair at the heart of it. I ignored it. But a time came when I could no longer do that. You're a force of nature, Jackie, you've complicated everything but yourself. You're changing the world, and refusing to let it change you. I for one am in awe. Jack reaches, takes the baseball from him. A beat as they consider each other. Finally, a promise... Rickey here. And eliminates the Giants and Boston. He puts an X' through Boston and the Giants. The rest of the NL are already crossed out. Only the Cardinals remain. At the same time, Parrott X's the same out on his notebook. We'd have to lose nearly every game for the Cardinals to catch us now. One more win may do it. Who's pitching tomorrow for the Pirates?"
chaos,CONNERS ,Jason Statham," Do you have a warrant? There's where your shit out of luck because I don't need to speak to you. Huh? You don't look like much of a Detective. Charming. Save your breath. I really don't care. Why don't we can the chit-chat.    Get to what's on your mind. No shit? Why should I?  You may want to put a leash on him.  Saying I did want to help... I'm still suspended or did that slip your mind? Just like that? Always a catch. You mean ex-partner. For a moment there, I thought you cared. I appreciate the words of encouragement and the confidence you have in me. I look forward to the continuing, positive relationship we've shared in the past. I'll give you two...  Blow me. If you need a follow-up comment let me know?  Cunt made her career off me. Teddy, Vincent...  ... Nice to see you both. I was not responsible... Fuck you. Look who's talking about destroying lives.  I'm going to miss him. You're just a wealth of knowledge, aren't you? I'm sure it won't be the last. Get me a line into the bank. Let's see what they really want. Who am I speaking with? Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there? Can we get you anything? Food, medical supplies. We heard an explosion. My fame proceeds me. I was, but I'm back.   You're information's old. Yes. Someone's dead? What else will I be looking for? Safe to say. Lorenz... Wait, we're talking here...  Try again.  Try again.  Where's our fearless Captain? So you're here in his place. Nicotine gum. Caffeine, too, if you must know.  What? A man's capable of change. Don't worry, I still have a vice or two. Try again in five. Precisely. He knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct. He's disguising his voice, means he's got a record and has done this before. He's heavily armed and well-connected. He knows he's surrounded. He hasn't asked for a damned thing. He drops that hint about sunrise, prepping us for a long wait. He's buying time. Why? Probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me. Giving him the time he needs. Or... he's got what he came for and he's waiting for his ticket out of here.  We're going in. The bank has three points of entry. Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team, head to the West side. We'll have the SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker, you're with me. Where is the SWAT Commander? You questioning me, Teddy? I question how you can fuck that asshole and still manage to look in the mirror.  The hostages are in imminent danger. They've confessed to killing someone, an automatic murder one charge - that's a life sentence, maybe a needle for all of them. So why keep witnesses around to testify? Longer we wait, the greater the risk. We need to go in. Now. What's the best way in? Hold on. No explosives. I got forty civilians in there, too great a chance.    Any other way?  What if we cut the power? That will disable the system and we can open the locks manually, come in that way? So we'll take the pussy way, Commander. We cut the power and go in at 11:15 sharp! It will be over before that. Commander, your men in position? I will call for the power to be cut. Once down, wait for my signal and enter. No one moves until I give the ""go"", understood? You have done this before, right? Wait... I don't want to know.  Let's go around the horn. Here we go... Cut the power. Doors!  Hold it. What just happened? No.    Do not go in.   It's a trap!  SONOFABITCH!  The rest of you, come with us.  We split up.  You two with him. You two with me.  Check the back.  See anyone come your way? We let them walk right past us. SHIT! I want background checks on every hostage. They're all suspects until they're not. After this, nothing would surprise me.  What's with this one? So we can't ID them. They're long gone by then.  Go to the head of the tapes, from when they first went in. Document each move they've made for the two hours they were inside.  Have Vincent check it out.  Shit. Feds.  What does that mean? This is all real fascinating shit, but what about the money? Bank robbers still like cash, don't they? Depends, are we talking about your sex life? Because I've heard shortcomings. You came to me. I didn't ask for this. You wanted this to happen. You don't say. What?  Try that again? That'll be all.  You're a College boy. Which one? Someplace I've heard of or one of those inbred state schools no one's heard of? Not exactly Princeton, but not bad. How did you end up on the force? Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's Dad and so on and so back? You've grown on me. Besides, I am entrusting my life to you. I should know something about you. I would think you'd like to know a little something about me. You don't say that with much enthusiasm. Listen, my reputation often proceeds me. You, however, have no reputation; a fact I need to deal with. After you've been through the shit I have, then you can judge me. Now... we can try to work together, make the best of a bad situation or we can compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you. But since this is your first day here... today... mine's bigger.  Go. Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10. It's overrated. I'm an Ivy League guy.  Well, that explains you. Got an address?  Step back. Clear the door.     Now.  I'm fine. He wakes, they call.  Hey Quincy, give it a rest, I'm fine. I should do a lot of things. I'm fine. No. Of course she doesn't.   Vincent! Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation one and turn the A/C on full. Leave her alone and cold. Let me know when her nipples can cut glass.  Your father was Harry Dekker?  That was some fancy riding.    You have a bike? Somebody going on a trip? Marnie, you're looking well. Can we get back to work? Is that new? Do you remember who headed up the Pacific Savings case? No reason.     Just thinking out loud. When you said it was your ""family business"" I didn't think... I guess I just didn't connect the dots. Your father was a hero. At first I thought maybe you were related to the Captain. The Captain, he just kind of ""discovered"" you. Through the academy, to excellent evaluation reports, while on the beat, to the high test scores on the detective's exam. That's how he found me. Maybe we're not as different as you think. We found the money. That money came from our evidence room. So, where were you going? This isn't possession or solicitation, Gina. This is felony-murder one. You could get life.  It's ""I didn't do anything."" ""Didn't do nothing"" is a double negative, infers the positive. The grammar in this country sucks. This isn't going away. You want to walk out of here, you tell me something... now. You sure that's what you want? Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll make. The first will be to the public defender's office. The second to children's services. It's simple... if you insist on a lawyer, I take your kids. Not like you cared about them anyway. You were ready to fly the coop with ""Shit-for-brains."" I can and I will. Tell me what I want to know! Get her some coffee...     Something hot. I think for the first time in that girl's life she's telling the truth. Who would've known? It would've been my word against hers. Who do you think the jury would've believed? The only line around here is the `blue line', you cross that one, then you got problems. Ask Callo, he knows what I'm talking about.  Buzz us in. Have another donut, Frankie. That fat fuck is the sole guardian of the city's biggest source of contraband. Drugs. Weapons. Cash. All totalled, about $50 million or so just sitting here for the taking. Not if you were a cop.    You could just walk right in and... ...   Take whatever you want.   Shit. So what...     He showed you a warrant? What? You don't remember? The money from Richards's place traced back to the Pacific Savings heist a few months ago, a case Callo headed up. He doesn't need another reason to be pissed at me. They never do, Captain. Doesn't matter what I think.      Facts here speak for themselves. Then come and get me you piece of shit. What they told Callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan Callo would've agreed with. As cops we come across every temptation in the book. Money, drugs, power. We'd all like to think we can resist any urge, but... We're not saints. Man said he wanted vengeance. Me? Nothing about today makes sense.  Don't look at me, he's your find. Shutup. What? He moved it. Changed the angle.    He didn't want us to see something. If I worried about every threat made against me, I'd never leave the house.  Those are priority one. If he's got a record, I want an I.D. yesterday. Dax, can you hack in there and find out what they were doing on this machine? You like Italian? No, four.    More are coming. For all intents and purposes... he's Big Brother. No. A little wine. Last time I was here, you said that table in the corner was the ""best in the house."" Shane, what was that thing you said back at the house about ""returning to the beginning path"" or something? We're all ears. Continue. We have a genuine philosopher in our midst. What are you doing? It's too late. You've made your choice. Live with it. You got a name?  Sonofabitch. Prick used to work for some big-time software company until they caught him dipping into the company's slush fund. They didn't want the publicity so they didn't press charges. Couple years later, he was busted for looting the pension plans of retired cops. For a genius... he's a fucking moron. His lawyer put us on trial. Said we were crooked, abusive, that we planted evidence... We were in the midst of the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury bought it. They let him walk and we were the scapegoats. The guy was guilty. He was scum. That was the truth.  There's something they don't teach you. The system breaks down. You have to compensate to get results. Break, no.     Bend... if it means justice...     Absolutely. You okay? First day in the city and you've already been shot.  Take five, guys. Hiya, Damon. How you feeling? You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me shit for my interrogating skills... least I don't threaten them with a lethal overdose. You never think of the repercussions. The suspect's mother, father... Brother. How your decision affects them.  He had murder in his eyes. It was pouring. Lights everywhere.       If he had only done what I said. Drop the weapon. But it was not to be. So why become a cop?  We go now all we get is Galt and Harrington. We want Curtis. Now relax and keep the line free.  This prick's driving me crazy. Shit. I'm out of gum.  We hold. No one move.  No. Stand down.  No. No go. We wait. We have three cars here and uniformed backup in all directions, if they ride, we'll get them. I want Curtis. We don't go in that house until I say! Trigger happy, Sons of bitches! We take them alive! Teddy!?     What's happening? GUN! Drop the weapon. Let the girl go. Think about this... you kill her, where are you going to... There's a passage in the Surangama Sutra which, roughly translated means: ""Things are not what they appear to be: nor are they otherwise."" Think about that a minute... Doesn't that blow your mind?  What gave me away? At the diner. That's right...       Well, to err is human. Was it Harry that gave him up? That wasn't him. That was my mistake. I called you. I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it. York always thought ""the plan"" was flawless. He was cocky. I told him you have to leave room for error. You can't always predict how it's all going to play out. A random camera catches an image of Richards, the scent on the money... you. You were the biggest wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory... When you got that... I was impressed. The more information you gather, from as many sources as possible, no matter how unpleasant the methods are, the better. And while I'd like to take sole credit it was a team effort. She'll get over it. Scott Curtis won't be bothering anyone again. Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington, Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The world's safer with them gone. The kid at the bank... that was unfortunate. But... you live with your decisions. You choose to take this road... there is no half way. It's all or nothing. That's why others fail. They don't make the commitment. I won't make that same mistake. Callo deserved his fate.      It's his fault. If it weren't for him, York and I would've never done this. One random act, causes another, causes another, and in the end... the pattern emerges. That's the Chaos Theory.  It's after six. The money's cleared. I'm a wealthy man. Lei, for all his evil, was one smart sonofabitch. The Feds will be tracing false leads for weeks. They should've suspended me after I testified. What did they expect? Everybody who screwed us, got screwed. Everything in its right place. This wasn't about killing, Shane. This was about standing up for what matters. Besides... you kinda grew on me. I already have. I'm not even here now. This is a very valuable lesson for you to learn, and it's good to have learned it early. You don't always win. I'm an opportunist. I would've gladly died in the line of duty, but they took that away. If they had been as faithful to me, as I to them none of this would've happened. The system broke down. Good luck, Detective. It would've been an interesting partnership, but I have to go now. No thank you. I'm fine."
bridesmaids,ANNIE ,Kristen Wiig," Yeah, I had the best time. I have't had that much fun on a first date in years, ever... She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her long time lover. Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What? Yeah, yeah. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. Annie struggles to maintain her composure. Yeah, me too, I'm soo busy-- Yeah, summer, exactly. It's a crazy season. So you just wanna give me a call in the fall or--? You shouldn't be! Yeah, Halloween-- Me too, I'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awaycause I'm doing really well at work. It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's science. I'm-I don't want a relationship either. Let's just say that. And I wouldn't even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. I'm just different from other girls. Yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've cut hair before. He waits, but Annie doesn't budge. Yeah, me too. Gonna try to get some sailing in before the weather gets crazy... Oh, no problem. Made from scratch. No, I love it! The gate starts to open. Annie exits. Byyyyee! Oh, shit. The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away. I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid now. I think I might be a little bit stupid. No! But I gave him a blow job. Well, he kept putting it in my face. Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh. At least you have someone. God, wha's wrong with me? I still don't think I do that. I brought him lemon-bars because I was making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're right, that's weird. Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when I was getting my braces off and farted at the orthodontist. Lillian laughs. Are you serious? God, I haven't seen you in months! Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here. Sometimes there is, so....there have been. At times, there has been. Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could really- Five? It's so hard to make commission over there. Many times. Okay.  I do want it. Hello, can I interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? No? We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V. Yes. I'm beat. Thanks. Goodnight Steve! She shuts the door behind her. You're right. God, she's getting really skinny. What? Oh my God! Look, he showed up with your mom. It's a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking boots. They laugh to themselves. Annie keeps reading. Cool! They're making a WKRP movie. What? Lillian splays her hand over the magazine showing off a sparkling DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING. Lillian! What is that?! What?!! It's beautiful. Lillian. Oh my God, this is...this is crazy! That's not I mean. I mean, I remember when we met him at Lake Mills. You lost your virginity to him right in front of me on the dock, remember? No, I don't. It's just making me realize how long we've known each other. Oh my God! I don't know what to say! Uh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God. I've never been in a wedding. I know what you're doing. Don't downplay this. I'm happy for you. And someday when hell freezes over and I get married, you can be my Maid of Honor. But for right now, this is about you. OK? This is you're day, and it is a big deal. Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys set a date? Well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and-- Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles. Ooo, haha... Annie continues laughing alone. She looks around the room as her smile disappears. She remembers... I do. Awesome!... Ooh, what's this... She finds the article. Hurry, before he gets away! Top five ways to reel him in. Hello? Yes? It's HELEN  Lillian's bridesmaid and friend from the tennis Club. She's a tall leggy blond, all smiles. East coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere turtleneck sweaters in her closet. She is sitting in a cream colored living room on a huge cream couch with lots of candles glowing. Hi. Of course, Helen. Hi! Oh, thank you. Annie, reads #2. Expose your best asset. ASAP She panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe, flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but politely smiles and goes back to his magazine. Sorry, yes. Hi! Yeah. It is quite an honor. I'm sorry, the what? I've never even been in a wedding before. Um, well, it should be fun. Annie sees that the hot guy is leaving to pay for his magazine! She reads#5. Make a funny observational joke that pertains to HIM. (ya know, LIKE SEINFELD!!] Men LOVE Um Helen, can you hold on for a second? Hey, you're dog's really cute. It's kinda funny right? That when girls are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs are cute. Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond. Well, some dogs are ugly. Some girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly girls. But I'm not friends with them. I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But some people I know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that. And people who are not nice...that's ugly to me. And female dogs are called bitches, that's weird. I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have better ones. The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone. Helen! Sorry. Yeah um, I'm really excited for all the wedding stuff and-- Yeah, Lillian told me last night. Awkward silence. Not yet. But they are coming, and I will fill you in-- Just these. Noticing a magazine by the register that reads (some bad And this. Whoa. Email DING. She checks her inbox. 48 NEW MESSAGES. Bridesmaids!, So excited to meet you!, Wedding Bells!,Super fun!,Engagement party! Hotel Rates,Shoes,Shower themes Does anyone have...,Cute Favor Ideas,Fitness program,Lingerie? Special thoughts Poem suggestions? Invite list for shower Contact list for bachelorette Making memories French manicures? etc. Oh my God. He probably didn't see you, Mom. Yeah, I'm sure that's it mom. Yeah. Mom I'm running a little late so-- I already told them, they understand. Ok, Mom-- I should get going. I have long drive. Mom I told you you don't have to send me-- I love you too Mom. Bye. They hang up. Annie walks to the kitchen. Ok, how do I look? Nevermind... Oh. Well, thank you. (looking at herself] That's actually a good idea. She starts to leave but sees a guilty look and some frosting on Steve's face. She looks over at her saran- 's. How many moonpies have you eaten? Tell me the truth. Ok, now really tell me the truth. How many did you eat? Shit! She pulls over. OFFICER RHODES approaches, chewing gum. No. Was I speeding? Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out. I'm sorry. I usually only drive in the city and they've never pulled me over. To tell you the truth, those lights have been out for like a year. What? No.. I- Can you do that? Look, I'm really sorry. I promise I will get the lights fixed tomorrow morning. I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm going to my best friend's engagement party, I'm the Maid of honor and so I really - Am I getting a ticket? He searches for words. She's cute and he wants to keep her there. He keeps smiling. Awkward silence. Here. He writes a ticket. I don't remember. Oh, Okay. Oh yeah. What? Do you want one? Hi Mrs. Donovan! They hug. I know, I'm so happy for her. Nope. Hi. Lil! It was nice meeting you Mary. Annie leaves. Hey! What's up? Where's Dougie? This place is so fancy. Dougie's parents belong here? Oh. Wow. I guess it's not what I pictured. Lucky you. Oh! So where's this guy you were telling me about? That's ok. Leslie, hi! How are you guys? No, no.  No. Annie meets DANA who is with her husband Ernie. Wow, that's beautiful. I never thought of it that way. No, I don't know him. He's not with me. He's just passing by. I'm not here with anyone. BECCA stands very close to her husband KEVIN, a good looking stockbroker type. Megan! How are you? Oh shit! Wow. Well, I'm glad you're OK. Hi. Oh, the Starbuck's of the candle world? Those are popping up on every corner. Which one do you own? Oh, wow, that's pretty cule. That is a lot. Yeah, I was just telling Lillian i's very elegant. Yeah in the nice part. I work at Harrington's Jeweler's. I love it. It's pretty well-known in the jewelry world. It's got like the biggest market for all the jewelry they sell and 'm actually gonna be getting a promotion Yeah, so I'm pretty excited about it. It's gonna be...pretty big. So, if you ever need a discount-- Thank you. Am I supposed to give a speech? As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees everyone in awe. Dana starts to cry. She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary. Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. 'm Annie. Wow, it really smells like vanilla in here. Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be awesome. Um, uh, God, oh, oh, oh, what's that saying? Ayay, um, God, um, what is it? It's a good one, a good saying, it's Irish. It's like a-like a toast. Is it Irish? Something about a road...Oh God, 'm blanking. So I'll just say I'm so happy to be a part of this whole celebration and happiness. You two are so happy together and hope you have a happy lifetime of happiness and celebrating. And I love you and....Lillian, w've been best friends since we were like 5...'ve never been to Greece... 't know if she's done. Annie sees Helen has moved over to sit next to Lillian. Did you ever know that you're my hero...You're everything I wish I could be.. C'mon you guys know the words. Some people reluctantly sing along. I could fly higher then an eagle. For you are the wind beneath my wings. Flyyy, flyyyyy, so fly into the sky, so fly until we touch up high-- Oh my God, tell me I didn't sing. God, I don't know, I was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech-- I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of your engagement party? I'm feeling slightly mortified. Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things? She just got engaged two weeks ago. Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can handle it. A guest walks by and taps Helen. Oh well... Oh, great! No, I got it. Sorry... Well, it's official. Lillian set a date. October tenth. Why did I just get a stomach ache. Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for Lillian. That dress is beautiful. Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write... Hi. I need to make these shorter. I know, it's... I can't work with them so long. Ok. Alright. Here it is! Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly it's you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that's cool. Oh and also, there's a restaurant inside, so um, I figured, we could maybe have lunch after. So, let's go! She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees a buzzer. Oh, I didn't see that. She presses the buzzer. Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses. Oh, Annie. Oh, she must be talking about the restaurant. (back into the intercom) No, we're here to look at dresses. Um, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to make a reservation for that. Sorry! Anyway, we're all out here now and-- Seven weeks?! What? No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so... No, no. I'll work it out. Don't worry. Yes, hello! Hey, you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses? Wow. That's amazing. Hi I'm Annie. Can I get a martini? What you mean you need to see I.D.? Thank you. Annie laughs. And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male model in a tuxedo. Hi. Hello Christian. They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her. Oh, Christian! I need a place to hide. Yeah. I think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash-- Huh? Well, what about this one? Everybody stops and looks at Annie. I think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again. The sash comes in different colors not just this one. Or this one! People wear sashes to the Academy Awards all the time. I think Lillian would like this one. This dress is almost $500! No, that's what I'm saying. That's a great price. They only have salads. No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago. It just didn't work out. No it's fine. But he didn't steal the money, I loaned it to him. And HPV is really common right now. Everyone looks around. Around fifty percent of sexually active men and women acquire HPV at some point in their lives and by age fifty, eighty percent of women will be infected with a genital HPV infection. About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect Americans each year. Very few HPV infections show any signs or symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner. Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out.. Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past. We weren't meant to be. My last pap-smear came back normal so that's cule. But you know, I'm dating, here and there... Oh, I didn't even think about that. Really? Yes. What?! Come on! She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches. Oh hi. I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I forgot. You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you? I was? Yeah. Don't talk about cravings right now. I am PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right now. They stare at each other out of awkwardness. Sorry. Thanks. Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I get paid next week. Bye! She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave. Trust me, I've been in the jewelry business for a long time. Nothing says I'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip. An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced. We also have yo-yos you can engrave. In memory of...um, what's your friend's name? The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches. I'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that I'll never wear again. Help me! I can't find anything to wear for my date with Mike tonight. Listen, I'm going on a date. This? (holds up a dress) or this? What's wrong with'em? Shit. These are my only clean pants. Thanks Steve. I'm not an expert in corporate real- estate but I've always been interested in it. So, yeah I totally agree. Mike smiles, he is cute! Me too. I can do that drive in my sleep these days. Thank you. I brush'em every day. She flashes her teeth. The hostess comes up. So, Becca tells me you play a lot of tennis. Oh, yeah I haven't rea-- No problem. No. Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you about my night. Oh my God. Call me. Very funny, Officer...Jones? No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm not drunk. Yeah. Recovering from a date. Finish your cleanse? Thanks for the drink.  So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people? That's a very good point. Yes. I'm starving. Ew! What is this? Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot. The what? No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands. No, no! Don't eat it! EW!!! She throws it on the ground. I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life. I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up. Yeah. You're probably right. Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car. It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's unpredictable. I don't know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now. Plus I'd feel like ninety around all those college students. Hmm. I think I get it? Moonpies. What? Oh yeah. Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight. Sorry.  Yeah I'll have the number four, and can you make that Super Biggie? Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that I lived with broke up with me over the phone. Then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that I'm still paying off. Because I can't find him. Oh my gosh. It's twelve thirty! I should probably... For me?! Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my gosh! No,no. Can you hold on a sec? She waves at Rhodes and mouths... I guess I'll see you around? K. Bye. So, you're in town? No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I was just driving. Me too. I love it. I feel good right now. Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit card at the restaurant! Shit! She picks up her phone and dials. Hi, Donna, it's Annie. Um, sorry but I just ran out of gas and I'm gonna be a little bit late. Yes, I know, 'm really sorry. I will get there as soon as I can. I promise, I'm so sor---hello? Hi! Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn't that technically be me? Honor? Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener? No? Ok, let me get Sandy. Yes. Yes. I'm on it. Got some ideas. So I'll let you know. Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I can. She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer. Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas? I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been. No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay for the bride. Well, I could save up for it. Told you I'd pay you back! Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly. We see these words: Dear bridal party, great idea, bachelorette party, Florida, Sea World!, Free place to stay!. She presses send, and is very pleased. The phone immediately rings. Hello? Hi. Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames. Well it's not just Sea World. It's a weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days. Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it. Oh, can you hold on? That's my other line. She clicks over. Hello? Oh well, Turkey's really far away. Hang on... Annie clicks back over to Helen. Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back? Just a few minutes. I'll call you back. Annie clicks over. Becca? Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me. Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call you back? Soon. Annie clicks over. Hello? Of course it is.. Dana is on her porch swing drinking lemonade. Really? But Vegas is so hot, don't you think? It's like, hot and dry. People get sick there all the time. Yeah, I just think it's probably not-- Hold on.  Hello? No. Leslie in her Sopranos style living room on a treadmill. Her kids run around. That sounds really expensive. Oh no, no, I was just thinking about everyone else. That's all I'm saying. Please, one day a week, just for a little while. I've already asked everybody else. I really need the money. That's alright. I understand. They're called peanut butter kisses. Yeah, I've heard that. Ok everybody! You guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas! Woo! Lillian walks up. Oh, it's no big deal. I didn't want to blow all my money on a first class ticket. I'm here though, right?! Ok, you guys, gather around. Welcome to Lillian's bachelorette party! We should probably get a bunch of cabs and head to our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis Royal Suites... As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her. The New Marquis Royal Suites. Ok, everyone just get in the car. Got a ride to the hotel. It's taken care of. Uh! Shoot! I left my sunglasses downstairs. Ugh! Where's my head? Hi, I have a reservation for Walker. RICK, an East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front of a large portrait of himself, posed exactly as he is now, with the same outfit. He holds the pose, smiling. Yes. Rick waits for her to notice the painting, but she never does. Yes. Yes. Oh my God. Hello cat.nan Oh. Yeah. Cool. Alright Everyone raises their glasses. The night has begun. Okay, mine was...great, got it. Becca scoots in next to her. Oh, um, we had dinner. Oh, I got it right here, I figured out what I owe so, should I just pass it around? Yeah, it's probably just easier...just split it. I had soup and ice water. No alcohol...or any real food. How does it even out? How does that happen? Everyone, including Annie, puts in their money. Helen moves over to Annie. Really?! I thought we were going to the Jungle Lounge after this. Oh...um...wow. Awesome. Here's the thing I was going to stop by the hotel, the Marquis Suites. I think I ate something weird on the plane probably, my stomac's not right. Okay. Perfect. Me? What do I have to roll? Annie. Four! Ahhhhhhhhh! Oh, hold on. You guys, my phone. I'll go outside then. Ok, guys put me down, put me down. Whoa, that's my breast. It was nice meeting you guys. I gotta go. I'm here with a bunch of friends and 'm supposed to meet them at this club. Oh, Ok. As the cab drives away, we hear: You guys almost done? How much further? For me? Bye guys. Hi. One please? Here ya go. Hello!? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm here! Where are you?! I'm at the Jungle Lounge, where are you guys? This place is huge! The club! What?! Hello?!! I don't even know. I'll have two lemon drops. That's what I'm saying. Some people have everything and others have just little bits of things. It's not fair. I don't get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen. That is the sexiest think anyon's ever said. Hi. Sorry I fell asleep while we were making out. I guess I was pretty tired. Oh shit. There's a knock at the door. Annie opens it to reveal NICOLE, , pretty and sweet. First of all- Ok, that is not nice. No, I'm in my low thirties...(under her breath) and you could never kick my ass. You heard me. Annie immediately gets punched in the face. Annie is shocked and swings back, hitting Nicole in the face. She's proud of herself. Nicole's two friends enter and jump on Annie. HUGE GIRL FIGHT. That's hilarious. It's covering up bruises, cuts and a hickey. I got into fight with a community college student and her friends because I spent the night with her boyfriend after spending the entire night trying to find you. Forget it. Well, I-(to Lil} Can I talk to you for a minute? Annie takes Lillian away. I wasn't sick. Helen told you that because... I couldn't afford to go with you guys. Helen, can you just give us a minute? That's funny. You know what? As the Maid of honor, which is what I am and what you are not, I am asking you to just give us a minute. No, excuse me! I need to take it easy? First of all , we're gonna need some ones over here. Here's a hundred. Keep twenty for yourself. I need some gum. Hi. I was just stretching my legs. What? I thought it was seven. Excuse me? No, I'm not. I'm telling you I am not jealous of Helen, okay? She's tall and thin and rich and pretty. They both laugh. Oh yeah, I got it goin' on... Thanks a lot. They nudge each other. He accidentally nudges her off the car. Have a good rest of your shift. Oh. Sorry. Hmm. Sounds familiar. No, no. Um, I feel the same way. Um, anyway um, maybe I'll drive by you next week. I have to make this drive again...so... She tries to flirt a little, pulls her hair back. He sees her hickey!!!! She starts itching her arm, still flirting and laughing. Ugh, great, I think I was allergic to the soap at the hotel. Ahhhhh. I promise. Ok, well, have a good weekend. Oh, that's good. Oh. I know where I got it. Huh? Oh...I did a face mask. I must have gotten some on me and didn't rinse it. Listen, I want to talk to you about-- What's wrong? It's ok. I mean it's not like it's your first time doing it. You can still have sex, just put a towel down in the bed. You just said a string trio or horn trio. I thought you didn't want anything fancy, you know, just keep it simple. Not a big deal. Helen. No, I'm doing laundry, what's up? I know. I know. I'm trying to-- Wow. You should have it. You should have it. Ok? Your best friend? For now. Well, what's gonna happen when you get older? Did you ever think of that? What about when she makes new friends and they're more successful than you are? Girl stares annoyingly, chewing and sipping. Huh? And they buy her facials and designer dresses for cheap and yo're stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh's outfit cost more than your rent? You're stupid. You're gonna be a slut in high school. (quietly] You. Little. Cunt. The girls eyes widen. The camera pans to show that the girl's dad and Donna have been there the whole time. Bye. Yep. It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her name and address in calligraphy. When Annie opens the lid, Canon in D plays and a real butterfly flies out. Are you kidding me? The invitation reads: You have got to be kidding me. No, it's a C.D. She rolls over and turns it off. I'm not. I already know what it's gonna be like. It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I don't wanna go. Oh my God. She turns into the gates of Whitewater Estates. There is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom. As she gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by. At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray. Yes. I don't have a cup-holder. As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside her car. I'll take those. Do I have to? An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She dismounts. The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her... Where? They point to the sign. Annie walks closer to see it is indeed a huge cookie. Beautiful party. Thanks.  Asshole. I said I love this shower, and i's amazing. I said all that. Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets approach Helen and jam out in her face. Mom. Hi! They hug. Wow! You look great. Not today Mom. I'm sure they're perfect and amazing. What? Yeah, that's mine. Thank you.  Ew. Kinda smells funny in here. Doesn't it? Smells bad. This house has a weird smell. Wow, looks like someone's a pervert. It's none of my business. She's gross. The ocean's are really polluted right now. Its not something to joke about. Well, you registered for 'em so thank yourself, you picked them out. I did't do anything... (sotto] It's disgusting. Here Mom's here. Wow, cash. Kinda tacky. Lillian opens the envelope. Are you fucking kidding me? Nothing have fun at Sea World. Shut up you ridiculous person, you a sneaky little cream and white cashmere--. I think you do. Horses? Sculptures? Posters? Look at this stupid house! This stupid marshmallow puffy furniture!  And look at that cookie! Would you please everyone! Speaking of that cookie. I never got a piece! Annie marches into the back yard. (shouting, we see her through the large Mmmmm. Nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate! Hello swan, are you having fun? Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers? I actually thought I wanted to be like you...and you and YOU, to be a part of this world. That's not who I am. I make bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid job, I'm thirty two years old and I still answer booty calls. I don't like Mike Donahue cause he  on our date. I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow! AND you know when we were in Vegas? When you were all staying at your luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box! Because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass. Congratulations! Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her. Well let me fill you in. Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit. I'm selfish? You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this. Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you! Well at least my friendship's not for sale. This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms back inside. Thank you! Her car won't start. Trying to keep it together, she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms down the highway, trying not to cry. A cop car pulls next to her. I's Rhodes. Yes. Taillights. I know! I KNOW! Yes, you're friend! But I didn't ok?! I didn't get them fixed! I don't-- HE hit ME! Why are you yelling at me?! I'm! Sorry! He calms down. Well save yourself the trouble, and don't. Well, I have said no anyway. Oh, hi. Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible. A week? Yes I did. Everything's just... She starts crying. Steve hands her a tissue from the middle console. I'm sorry, I just--this has been a really shitty day. Yes I do! Right? Thank you. This is not about attitude. It's just the facts! My life hasn't turned it out the way I expected. I don't have any of those things that gives a person points in the world. No. The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her. Oh, hey Ted. You're in town. Really? Ok, sure. Ted smiles at her. Annie stops herself. Wait no. No. No. I don't think I do. Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good. NO girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're LYING. But it's not your fault. Its me. It's me. Have a great life. And you can keep the plant. Annie grabs her stuff and leaves. No, I think we've covered everything. I'm really excited and thank you. Annie gathers her things. I'll see you next Monday. What time do I start? I won't be late. (smiling] Yeah. Ok. Hi, I'm here to inquire about financial aid. Her cell phone rings. I'm sorry? Annie's trying to find her phone. Thanks. It's too late, she looks at her phone. It was Lillian. No message. She doesn't call her back. Discount? Are you serious? You're kidding! If you see him, would you thank him for me and tell him that I'm crazy and I'm sorry. He'll know what you mean. Hello? Oh. Hi-- What do you mean she's missing? Um, gosh I..I don't know. Um, I'll come to you guys. I'll be there in an hour and 45 minutes. I wanna help. Annie hangs up, grabs her keys. She stops, comes back and grabs a small paper bag, and runs out the door. Oh my God! I think I know where she is. We're almost there. Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons of them. Annie goes to get out of the car. Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards on. Helen puts them on. Helen, do you have a jack? Dana calm down. Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do. Annie puts the jack under car. Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She really does know what she's doing! The car is raising. Megan hand me the wrench. Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side. Dana and Becca stand with Helen. I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off. Just changing the tire. Nope I think we got it. But thank you. He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other. Almost there. The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He puts his hands on her ass. OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan, Helen let's go! All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie is finishing. Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so far down your throat you will shit out...your fucking..face! Get out! Helen hit him over the head with a tree. They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile. There it is, turn left up here. Go down the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway. It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie met. The house is right up here. They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car. I thought she'd be here. I really thought she'd be here. I'm sorry. No, it's not. I don't know what happened. I messed everything up. Lillia's not even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid to see what's really happening. Lillian's moving on to this great life and I feel left behind. And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now. Everyone is silent. Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled by the flash. I'm sorry that when I left the shower I told your neighbors you were shooting a porn. Oh, well, "

darkman,JULIE ,Frances McDormand," Mr. Strack, my name is Julie Hastings. I'm here from Pappas and Swain to represent you in the Von Hoffenstein negotiation. Gorson's tied up in litigation this week. Don't worry--I've done my homework. Then I guess we're only missing one element here. An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful. He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie. He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods. Wine is poured around. .Mr. Katz, I've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth. CONTINUED ...Location. Location. And... location. Frankly, you have none of the above. Your fair price is fair for midtown commercial, not for riverfront. if my client can spin straw into gold, he'll still pay market price for straw. As a matter of fact-- Our offer stands at forty-eight. To Von Hoffenstein: CONTINUED You're moving in the right direction, but our offer stands firm. i believe if anyone had .There's been a mistake. We ordered a bottle of '67 Beaujolais Maison Reme. Is that not correct? No. You have served us a 1981 or 1982. California Beaujolais. At any rate, our offer stands at forty-eight... As she rises: .And if we can't toast, we prefer not to drink. These gentlemen and I have other business to attend to, so if you'll excuse us... Strack Sr. rises, angrily. He turns to leave with her, murmuring under his breath: is uneasy. She halts halfway up the stairs to listen. We hear only the scurry of cautiously. Peyton? You were so slick. Although we broke up sixteen times. Sunset and distorted music. Not just yet they haven't. The slide changes to a shot of a bottle covered in wax. I never gave you that. The champagne bottle is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player. The music plays over the image. Haunting. Romantic. I thought it was beautiful- I know. Peyton wraps his arms about her. Julie moves close and they kiss. .Dale Gorson, please... Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on the papers in front of her. Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him. Then: Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I was supposed to find... From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious. They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission... Peyton, behind her, massages her back. .They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the very least... Well, the way I'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first... Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it's the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she turns to Peyton. In an impressive corporate power suit, briefcase in hand, walks briskl y down the sunny sidewalk, stopping at the intersection to sig nal a cab Suddenly, running up behind her.. What's the matter? Marriage--well, we could do that--of course, there's our careers--I men, I'm just starting to get things going at the firm. And, you know, I kind of like having my own I love you, Peyton... She climbs into the cab, closes the door. (through the open Watches Peyton grow smaller as the cab moves off. Julie looks longingly back at Peyton. Did she make the right choice? She back once more for Peyton but he is only a tiny dot in the distance. Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Strack... I'm --sorry about your father. I heard last night. No thank you. Mr. Strack, I've been going over some documents and I came across something that puzzled me. It's a memo from your office to a Mr. Claude Bellasarious--it went out over your father's signature. It detailed ...It seems like the payments... were- Well it's hardly my place to-- Surely you don't expect me to endorse it. All right, you're point is well taken. But the fact remains that I'm in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime. You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to destroy one of your buildings. I wish it were that simple. First of all, I don't have the memo with me. Even if I did-- Are you threatening me? He's an underworld figure-- racketeering, drugs. For now. please be there Peyton. Vodka and lime, please. A double. A business man, flushed with drink, observes her. He moves to the seat beside her. Just giving them something to swim around in. She drinks the vodka quickly. She sighs. Please remove your hand. The businessman has his hand on her thigh; it crawls upward. CONTINUED Thanks for getting rid of that guy. The decision's been made for both of us. The papers were destroyed in the fire. I want to forget all about that-- What? No. No. I've considered it. but the police ruled out arson. It burned hot. A gas fire. There was an acetylene leak -- the tiniest spark finally smiles. resents being gripped and lectured to and yet... she senses in Strack, a power and magnetism that holds her. I'll consider it... Strack smiles. As he sweeps her around, her eye catches something. Her face tightens. Mr. Strack, I don't want to alarm you, but who is that man, speaking with the Governor? suddenly sits up from a dream and cries; Peyton...' I want to thank you for a lovely evening, Louis. It's been a long time since I've been able to really enjoy myself--to forget... Can I offer you a drink? We pan the room to reveal Strack, just inside the front door. It's on the etagere... Strack has already found it and is dialing. Don't be childish, Louis, it's unbecoming to fish for compliments. Strack laughs good-naturedly. Like anyone else. No, I understand... ..Were you ever married, Louis? I'm sorry. Strack strains to conceal the bitterness of his grief. It must have been a terrible time. I wondered how you understood. About me. You've been very patient. And very kind. Strack smiles warmly. He takes her hand. Is it really...? I thought you were dead... You look the same. You look fine. Of course they can. But I don't understand. Where --- Sold me, Peyton. Hold me and never let me go. I've been so unhappy and I want you to hold me forever. Peyton... Peyton, it's like you were never gone. I'm happy again, and it's like the time in between never happened. But why do you have to stay at this burn center? You can stay at my place now. Peyton, I still don't understand. Why didn't you come back to see me before now? Of course I still want you. Well...if that were the case... I don't know. But why even ask me that? The point is: You're fine. Your back. Just like always. She smiles. Peyton is filled with the warmth of being accepted and wanted once again. We cut from Darkman's ravaged monster-face to: -- Peyton! Where have you been? Why haven't you called? Put away that watch or I'll think you don't like me anymore. Oh, Peyton, let's spend the whole day together -- the whole week! A beat. What? What's going on, Peyton? What are you keeping from me? Why do you always have to run? Peyton looks at the pyramid, avoiding her look. He throws the first ball; misses. - Can I take you back to the burn center? Peyton's vein begins to throb faintly. Peyton, it doesn't matter. Peyton is fighting to contain his rage. in clipped words, between gasps for breath: Peyton... It's okay... Peyton! No! Please! Peyton! Peyton?! 364 No answer. She cautiously advances. Her eyes fall 364 upon something that makes her gasp. Dear God. Peyton. .? Why didn't you tell me? If you loved me, why didn't you tell me? You had no right-- coward! Do you think it was the face I cared about?! Is that how little you think of me?! Why didn't you come to me? I would have helped you. She stares into the shadows a long time without speaking. Don't you know I love you, Peyton? And no matter what--no matter what you've become I'll always love you? I can't go, Louis. We have to talk. Thank you, no. Louis, I can't see you anymore. You know about Peyton, the man I was Louis, he's alive. He's back. He was burned, horribly, horribly burned--I don't understand what happened but I know he needs my help. Strack is visibly taken aback. He sets the brandy down. He's living in an abandoned warehouse. He's alone... he needs me. The phone RINGS. Strack crosses to the desk and picks it up. She reaches for a tissue. Next to it is. Wipes a tear from her eyes. She moves closer. whirls to face him. He stands looking down over her shoulder. The fire... it wasn't an accident, it was you. turns to run. Peyton!! Guzman races out of one continental, Smiley out the other. recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her hair. Peyton, I can help. I don't care how you look, Peyton! I. love you. The burns don't matter. There's a long pause. Then Darkman turns the twisted remains of. his face toward her. Julie sees them in close-up. CLAMP! The elevator jars to a halt on street level. No. Darkman stares at her a long time, anguished, torn. (tears in her Peyton! Darkman's voice floats back as he stalks away: Peyton! She rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian, staring into alien faces in search of the man she loves."

I need to call an ambulance and contact my embassy. I need to make a phone call. Don't worry, I'll be right back. You're going to be ok. Bad. Very bad. And where should I take her?

Stop lying to me god damn it, and tell me what the fuck he said! Yes, we know that. What can you do in the meantime? You need some stitches. You're not going to give her any anesthetic? What kind of doctor is he? He can't take care of her. Honey, this is going to hurt a little. Calm down... calm down... Susan, they have to sew you up... relax... Honey, please try to relax... My love, don't move. You can't move, calm down. You can't; there's only one phone in town. I'll call them later. You can't leave us like this. At least wait until an ambulance comes. Is there anyone around here who can take them in? Just wait, the ambulance should be here any minute now. Thank you. Is that your daughter? Eight? Three...  Yes, just two. What about you? How many wives do you have? And is this where you live?  When did he find out? What? Tell him to call another one. He has to get another one. What the hell do you mean there isn't another ambulance? You've got to get her out of here... She can't stay here or she'll die. Call another fucking ambulance... Come on, move... call another ambulance... How the fuck are they going to deal with it? It's your shitty fucking country's responsibility.  A helicopter?... Let's get out of here... I need to make a phone call. Stop fucking with me. Oh no? Leave asshole. I'm fed up with that asshole. Calm down? My wife is dying up there. Where the fuck do you want me to take her? You leave and I'll kill you... Rachel... What's going on? Nobody's come... Who have you talked to... we need help...she's dying... She's very weak, please, you've got to do something. You can't just make these stupid fucking calls, you've got to do something... How the fuck do you expect me to calm down? Susan is dying... There's no time. I need to get Susan out of here now! Put Mark on the phone... God damn it, connect the fucking call. Mark, help me... Susan is dying and there are no ambulances, there's no hospital, there's nothing. I don't give a shit about political problems... Do something, now, please... Son of a bitch... Stop... Stop... Stop you mother- fuckers stop... What do you need? You're not going to die. You can't die. You just can't. No, I'm not going to leave them and don't you even think about leaving me, because I'll kill you like nobody's killed you before. What? I'm going to tell Mike on you, so you never scold him again.  Do you have a pot I can borrow?  Can you leave us alone for a moment? Come, try it like this. Forgive me my love. When Pat died I didn't know what to do, the pain drove me crazy... I was scared, that's why I left... forgive me. No, it wasn't your fault. I was wrong... Shhh... it wasn't your fault my love, it wasn't anybody's fault... Pat just left...  Forgive me, please. You missed; you got my leg. Does it hurt? Anwar...Anwar... We've got to get her out of here. Where's the clinic? Can you get us a car we can take her in? My love... I'm going to get you out of here.   We're going to try to take you to a clinic an hour and a half away from here. Do you think you can make it? I need you to be strong. Really strong. Thank you for lending us the car. Sweetie, you've got to hold on. Hello... Yes, speaking. My wife is dying. She's in urgent need of medical attention. We've been here for five hours. What the fuck are you waiting for? I can't wait anymore... I'm taking my wife to a clinic in Tinerhir right now... We can't wait any longer. My wife is in critical condition. How long is the chopper going to take? Thank you for everything. Thank you... The last thing I'm worried about right now is the fucking press. Is she going to be ok?  But she's going to be ok? Amelia? How is everything? They're going to operate now... Amelia... take good care of the kids, and don't tell them anything... Put Mike on please. Hey sweetie, how are you? Oh really? Yeah, I'm ok. Everything's fine."
megamind,MASTER MIND ,Will Ferrell," The real Einstein once said, ""God does not play dice with the world."" He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood? Alright, then - clean slate. Do we have the girl? Reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated. Alright, let's not keep the lady waiting. Miss Ritchi, we meet again. I trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe Uberman. And Miss Ritchi, I trust you've already met my new crew: The Mad Geniuses! In a way, I already have. What about my revenge? You have a wicked tongue. I hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen. Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi. And when I have ultimate power over this city, I have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it.  What is it!? Over here, old friend. Actually, I wanted to share the experience with my oldest friend. Oh, can't I? I have attained control of the Earth's most abundant energy source. I doubt even you are strong enough to withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED POWER OF THE SUN!!! Excellent. Stop here, I like this view. Any last words?  What's going on? What kind of trick is this? Yeah, so? Your weakness is copper?  Well...let's not get ahead of ourselves. I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S GONNA RAM US!!!  HOLY SHIT! ...so I did.  Oh, right.  Great, great. Put it on the pile. No. Maybe later. What is it, Plato? When I want your opinion I'll beat it out of you. I have defeated my greatest enemy. I have free reign over Metro City. I have more wealth than a thousand Sultans. I've achieved all I have worked for...so why am I so unhappy? I mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil.  MASTER MIND And, I have accomplished something he had only dreamed about - the destruction of Metro City's champion. I tell you, I've always lived with this unquenchable thirst. I thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power. But now that I've pretty much accomplished both, I am at a loss.  Oh, really? He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying, little gnat to him? ...What's the second part? YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD YOU GET SUCH A NOTION? Who the hell is John Cusack? John Cusack, huh? So all I have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS. Please, get a hold of yourself. I've got it! I've got it! It's plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create a new superhero.  Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis! Prepare the subject. Plato, pour the toxic waste. Drainage. Well, Severs? Okay then. And this one? Ah. Does he have extraordinary strength? Can he fly? Resilient to weapons fire? He just breathes under water, then. Plato, the radioactive spider, please. Anything, Stenwick? We're gonna need more venom. How `bout now, Stenwick? ....Stenwick? This has proven to be a challenge. I just don't know what I want. What do I want? I want a man of moral fiber with a strong sense of right and wrong. Someone who doesn't seek power - instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves, the courage to rise to the occasion. That's it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do? Then we'll make a new one. Plato, bring me the box! Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers. Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never got around to following up with that. ...Right. Man, he was good! Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure. Somebody like him!  A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love it. He volunteers. He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.  Then return to base. We have much work to do. Now, we're sure this won't kill him? Good. Slight electrical shock? Follow him. Welcome to your second birth, Hal Stewart. Instruction is very important in the formative years. Every hero needs a mentor, a father figure to look up to.  Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't believe it. He misspelled his name. No matter, I suppose. We've now fully established Titan as Metro City's hero. They will love him just as they loved Uberman. Everything is going according to plan. You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself. To what? The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over. You dare? What - did - you - call me? THAT is none of your business, knave! Silence! I'm warning you, Einstein. I said silence! Get out of my sight. Oh, no. Don't look at me. You're not gonna get all freaky about this, are you? I only did this because I wanted to talk to you on the same level. You know, without all the baggage? You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Roxanne! What?  Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato, it's his fault. He's the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. I'll filet his scrotum for this. Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous. I hardly give such matters thought I should just go up there and just lay it all out to her. ""Roxanne, I like you - I always have. Oh, and I'm sorry I blew up your ex. (realizing the absurdity of his words) Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a child's birthday party. What the hell am I even doing here? Who cares what she thinks? I'm a supervillain and here I am acting like a love struck schoolboy. Forget this. I control my own destiny!  Perfect. Hello, Triple A? I'll call you back. The lady said no. No, it's a goo gun. It goos. It's...a prototype. Don't - EVER - say that again. Don't flatter yourself. My, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves. No.  Fine, why do you ask? Go on. Just with business, my minion. Just with business. I've decided it is time. Yes, we've created our hero, now it's time to give him a little motivation. To be simply good is not enough. A hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected. Yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure. Gentlemen, it's time for Operation Mentor Kill! Alright, people, we don't have much time. Titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out. How's the death ray coming? Hum. Let's turn it down a few notches. It's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we? Anything on the radar yet? I see. Well, he must be planning something big. Are the flame androids deployed? Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me. No slouching. He'll be here. That's the way it works. Unprofessional, that's what this is. No, it's disrespect for the craft. Would Uberman have kept us waiting like this? Of course not. He was a pro who knew the score. It's time we spelled out a few things for this Titan. I will not be made a fool of. Do you know who I am? Oh, so NOW you want to get down to it. Well, I want to get a few things off my chest first. Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have any idea how long we waited for you? We're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge?  -You got to thinking? There's nothing to think about. I'm the villain. I do something bad, you come and get me. Maybe you're right. What's the point? What are these?  Where did you get all this? From where? Well, what about your mentor? You want to team-up? What do I think? I think you're probably the biggest idiot I've ever met. I mean, I can't believe you. All your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment. You know what? Your kind of people make me sick. Oh - gee - I am so sorry!  Of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser. I wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do? It hurts. It! I just made myself redundant, old friend. Well, there's no use crying about it now, we must take action. I'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon. We must destroy Tighten. Yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in Uberman's DNA - copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin always said: ""If something works don't dick with it."" Your time has come to an end, Titan! There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me. I have a better idea - NOW! That's copper my good man. Your one weakness.  MASTER MIND For all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect. He's not as dumb as I thought. What's funny? Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college. So it is. Well, then I wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find. I need your help. You're not going to like what I'm about to tell you. Tell me about it. Well, the evil thing he did by himself. My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner. And they call me Master Mind. In hindsight...  I had some left over from something. I infused him with it. Yeah, that's why I decided to tie you up. He seemed nice. Yeah, good to know - NOW! It's a modest profession! My lair is in the direct path of the ball. You don't understand. I have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable. I sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay? It's experimental - only one in the world...Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me can't pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous. It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...If destroyed it could...  Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard, actually. That little baby is amazing. I'm quite proud of it.  MASTER MIND  I mean...we'd better find a way to stop him. Did Uberman have a hideout? A cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. C'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance. Whose house? Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared - ""Metro City doomed."" You know, I never thought I'd say something like this, but here it goes - Not if I have anything to say about it. Such a dark place for one such as you. I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice? Good lord, man. You've only been dead for two months. A disguise so simple, it's ingenious. No wonder I never caught on. Two lives, yet in both you were an ideal. Perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend. I'll miss how predictable you were. Hello? Anyone here...besides..all the BIG MEN who are with me now?  What's the worst you're gonna find?  MASTER MIND The man was a boy scout, not a serial killer. Ahhhhhh! I might just ask you the same question. I had thought I incinerated you. Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing I couldn't figure out - A few months? How long had you been planning this? I see it all so clearly now. You must have done it just seconds before the observatory exploded. You bore out from under the cage. Then, using your Uber-Speed, - - you made your way to safety, where you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere. Then you must have flown to a safe distance and waited for the explosion, then... But why fake your death? Why go through all of it? You could have just quit. And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to disappear? I just can't believe it. This whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart? There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city. You're really going to do nothing? You're the only one who can stop him. A plane? Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap. I got lucky.  What do you mean? Game? - Was that all this ever was to you? You know, I was trying my best every time I fought you. Those `outs' as you call them were unintentional. I guess I was never really a match for you, was I?  Then how can I expect to be one for Titan? What about Roxanne? I guess I wasn't the villain I thought I was, and you...you weren't the hero I thought you were. Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible. I told you, Titan is too powerful. If he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it. To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. We'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best. Plato, do you have a better plan?! Hello...Roxanne? Right now I'm packing, later I'll have a snack on the train. In a word - yes. I didn't create this - the god's of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve. I'll make the time. You can leave with us. You'll be safe. Will you listen to me, no one can stop him. I'm afraid you have an inflated opinion of me. What? Sweet words, but that man is dead. Please, Roxanne, just come with me. Roxanne? Roxanne? Dad, it's me... (he looks around to make sure no one can hear) ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked in a while, and I'm sorry. It's been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy. Anyway...You raised me to be the worst that I could possibly be. And I've tried to live up to that as best as I could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. But I'm about to do something now that would really piss you off. I'm going to go against everything you ever taught me. I hope...I hope that maybe you'll look down at what I'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. If you could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me. Well...either way, you're probably going to see me real soon. (calling over his shoulder) Men? Stop packing. Our work is not finished here. C'mon, slow down C'mon. Gutterball! Bowling? What other trailer park sports can you play? Shit! Stupid monkeys and their fruit. Could it really be that easy-- Didn't think so. I'm alive. Uberman? I thought. For what? WAIT!!! Quick joke - What's the capital of Thailand? It's bang cock! So, I guess pennies are good for something. They're cheering for me. It's a...it's nice, you know? I usually don't get a lot of feedback.  But I also kind of caused all this. What happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this? I guess that is all in the past. I don't think I'd go that far...I mean I just...er... Yes? Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit. We're okay, right? I don't think it would go with your outfit. I'm gonna give you a chance to surrender. Way to take out those two goons, guys!  Sorry, we're new at this."
bones,PATRICK ,Khalil Kain," Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each. Moe's terms. I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination. I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem. Ours! I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back. Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me. Welcome to the Ill Zone. Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor. I got a great deal on it.  They couldn't give this place away.  Just dead meat stanking up their books for twenty years. The last owner on the lease before the bank was back in '79.  Some dude named Jimmy Bones.  Empty ever since. Yeah, you heard of him? Not that I remember. I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it. You gotta use your imagination.  Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential. Go on old pipes, groan all you like. Just please don't burst.  That I can't afford. That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time. Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better. I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I""m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here -- Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here. no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors. Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best. I manage them. I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park. Anytime.  Be seeing you. Hey, Dad. When we got a line of hundred paying guests and another couple hundred inside dancing, that's when I'll tell him.  And I can't wait to see the look on his face. And how do you think crack got into the ghetto?  By magic?  Who flew it in?  Like the man said ""we don't own that many planes."" But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better. Careful.  That's bad luck. Why? What else does she say? Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which. Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off? Lucky thing. The dead get out? And you believe her? Spooked? Yeah, there is a strange vibe here. Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath. ...we just been in the damn suburbs too long. We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different. I thought you were bringing the Colonel? Why not?  He eats everything else. Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man. Post-toasted's more like it. Must be something seeping through.  From the floor. Do you feel that? Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained. You got a better explanation I think these bring the water down from the bathroom.  Into this... Check it out.  The same shit that was in the carpet.  Told you it was from the plumbing. Damn, I knew these pipes were wacked. Yeah, well, Maurice is right.  It's gonna take more work than I thought.  But we can still do it.  We'll lay a real floor in here.  Put damping on the walls. Totally controlled sound.  Be perfect. No one could hear shit up on the street. Evidence of what? Get your damn dog, girl! Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you. Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then. Cinn? Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible. I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father? It's alright.  If you want to go home... Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys. What's wrong? Are you alright? Damned if I know. A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve. Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued. I bet you didn't even know your bank owned the place.  I did it through a broker so you wouldn't know it was me. I couldn't wait to see your face when I fixed it up. I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it. You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight. Be cool.  Everybody's gonna get in. Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner. Yo.  Maurice.  Where are you? We never did that.  Only...Maurice was into it. Did you do it? You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there. From what? Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places? Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too. I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people. Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites. Cinnabar?  Walk around the north side. There's an opening there. My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls. Save him?  What are you talking about? Where's Dad? Dad?  Open up.  Dad?? C'mon.  We got to get in there. You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go. Then we need to get out of here.  We can't try to explain this to them.  We'll be back.  Hopefully with Dad. But the place burned to the ground. There was a storm door, to the cellar. It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse. Here. We can climb out. Anywhere but here. Is this Hell? Shit. Thing worked fine a minute ago. Batteries were brand new -- Maurice.  Hold up, man.  Okay, we're on the second floor.  I feel it.  No more steps. Bill?!  Cinnabar?  Cinnabar?! Bill!  Bill?! Okay, okay.  Listen: Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there. Here! Yeah.  Come on.  Don't let go. Dad? Daddy? No!!! Cinnabar!  Stop! No!  Cinnabar, no!!!! We gotta jump! We have to! Cinnabar!  Where are you!? Cinn!  Jump!! Let's go!!! We made it..."
hostage,TALLEY ,Serena Scott Thomas," No one's going anywhere, L-T.  We can talk this guy down.  Hey, George?  George, don't kill the dog, okay?  We don't want to hear a gun go off in there. Where's the guy's wife? Goddamnit, you said we had her.  I told him we had her!  Pull the dog's name out of your ass.  Get the dog's name. I didn't lie to you, George.  You scared your wife pretty good last night.  We're having a hard time finding her. You and I have been talking for, what, sixteen hours?  Keep talking.  Is that your dog, too? I know you're hurting.  You lose your job, you find out your wife's fucking another guy . . . but don't give up. We'll have her talk to you. George?  Come back to the window. George?  Leave the dog alone and come to the window.  What's the dog's name? Murray!!  They're in the house!  His wife's in the house!  It's really hard, Jane.  This isn't the way I want it. I need to work out some stuff. I still see that boy's eyes. Is Amanda there? Can we talk some more when you get here? What are you talking about, shot?  What happened? Where are they? Sonofabitch. Are civilians inside? Holster your guns!  Mike!  Mike, can you hear me? Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away. We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses. Keep your head down. How you doing, buddy?  You still alive? Jesus.  You hang on. He's in the backseat! This is Talley.  Who's on? One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?  Quiet!  I want radio discipline.  Mike's hanging in.  Larry, Jorgy?  Listen up. Find out who lives at four-five-five.  We gotta know who's in there. Did he say if she was shooting at him? Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up? Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it? Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name. Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.  That's not enough. Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation. That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?  Louise? Get a phone number for the Smiths. Go, Mickey. Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.  News hawks.  There'll be more.  They monitor our frequencies. Everyone be cool.  That's our job right now--stabilize the situation and don't let things get out of hand.  All we have to do is hang on until the Sheriffs take over.  That's all we have to do. That's my job, Metzger.  That's why I get the big bucks.  My name is Jeff Talley.  Is this Dennis Rooney? The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car? We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there? Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him. How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you? All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation -- Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died. Dennis?  I want you to release those people. We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you. Has Dennis done time? Who's this? Have still prints made from the tape. Show the landlord.  Maybe we can get a fast ID. Here on his head.  Is that a tattoo? Says...burn it. He's watching Kim die. Just around the corner and up that street.  See the helicopters?  I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast -- The Sheriffs will take over when they get here. Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can. I don't know how long I'll be stuck here. Jane? I'm scared shitless. I have the only number that can call into the house? Way to go. Mr. Dill, these pricks didn't know what they were going to do until they did it. I want you to take a look at something. Can you identify this man?  Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier. Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that? You have his address?  Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.  Louise? Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place. Tell her I'm almost home. I'm Talley.  Who's in charge? I've got fourteen officers on my department including me.  We're as secure as we can be.  Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile. I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him. Whatever you want.  Who's that shooting?  Martin, what's going on? They're too close!  I told you not to crowd him!  Pull back your people; do not breach that house!  This thing good?  Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I know this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.  Look out the window, Dennis.  We are NOT entering the house.  We're pulling back. It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone. No one's coming in.  A couple of guys out here got carried away.  It's over.  He's cooling off.  I'm here. That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter. The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us. (mutes phone; to Martin and Maddox) I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?  Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret? I gotta piss real bad. I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while. He says he has gasoline set to burn the place. If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.  That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.  Go. You have her cell number? They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer. Did you find Jane and Mandy? What's wrong with the radio? Stand by. Is something wrong with Jane? It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that! Put him on.  Get Martin.  Right away.  This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son. Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot? How about you and your sister? Where are you right now? That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?  I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you. Thomas?  Thomas...? He says that his father's hurt. They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming. No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying. You want me to stick around, I could --  Jane?  If you're there, pick up, okay? Mandy? Take it easy. I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it. Who are you? What do you want? What is this? You can let go. Marlon and Al.... I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene. You want . . . Marlon and Al. These disks . . . where are they? I'm going back to York.  Have Larry meet me at the front gate. I want you to run this license plate and phone number.  Then I want you to find out everything you can about Walter Smith. ANDERS The guy in the house? Go back to the office.  Run his name through the FBI and the NLETS database. I think he's involved with illegal activity or he associates with people who are. Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry? Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut. Get to work. I'm re-assuming command of the scene. And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house. I changed my mind.  That's all you need to know. The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis. I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith. We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.  If you don't let me talk to him, they're going to attack the house. Help me keep them out!  Let me speak to Smith, Dennis.  Let me speak to him right now.  Talk to me, Dennis.  Help me help you. Why can't you put Smith on the phone?  Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that. Let me come get him. If you won't let me come in, then put him outside. You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court. Bring up the ambulance.  Okay, Dennis, we won't approach the house until you've closed the door.  Easy....  Let's do it. How's he look? No. I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him. Smith!  Wake up!  Wake up, goddamnit.  Who are you? Use smelling salts, give him a shot, whatever.  I just need a minute. Stop the fuckin' engine! Just one question.  Please. I want you waiting in Smith's lap.  I want to know the second--and I mean the second--that he wakes up.  Talley.  What'd you find out?  Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang? You get anything on Smith? Keep trying.  Call me.  If you're safe, call me. Put him on. The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk? I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay? I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt. Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al. I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to? I thought they locked you in your room. Can you get into the office? If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught? I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.  Don't question me, Captain!  This is my crime scene!  I'm a negotiator, Captain.  I negotiate. That's all you need to know.  Now are you going to help me or not?  Okay, bud, here we go.  Captain?  Kill the lights. It's time to talk face-to-face, Dennis. Come out, just you, and we'll talk. Come on, Dennis.  Talk to me. I'm unarmed.  I'm looking at you.  Get out here and let's talk. Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall. You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for? I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could. You picked a bad house to hole up in, son. Give up. The man you sent to the hospital is a criminal.  He has partners.  This is their house and their money and they want it back. Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life. Can you open them? Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are? Try Al.  See if you can open Al. Who is it? Sonny Benza.  Oh, fuck.  Leigh?  Metzger, answer me! Put a guard on Smith!  I want you with Smith until I get there! Get in the car.  Now. I'm posting a guard outside his room, but we'll need help from hospital security. Not with my officers here, no, ma'am. They're still in the house. I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.  I need to talk to him.  Alone. Sonny Benza has my wife and daughter.  He wants the disks, Marlon and Al.  He took my family to make me help. He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk. Another minute.  Please -- Do you think I'm going to let you murder someone?! I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the real FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got Smith!  I've got Smith!! I guess we do. Your phony FBI assholes. What do you mean by that? They here now? Yeah. Are all of you named Jones? You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move. How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here. What? Special Agent Jones. What are you people going to do? What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you? Let it go, Captain. It's mine.  Talley. Go, Mickey.  Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait. We're getting those kids out of there. We've got to get those kids out of there! Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He kills people!  Talley. You do what you have to do; I'm getting those kids. The kids are in here! Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later! Thomas!  Thomas, it's me! Stay close.  We're going to move fast --  Are the disks still in your room?  Smith. Yes.  A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan. How do I reach him? Two words:  Glen Howell. Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you. I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it. My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade. I think you got no choice. Yeah.  Police! Where's my family?!  Where's my family, you fuck?! You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they? You said they would be here!  Jane? You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not talk to them; have them. Close. First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk. I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk! I love you. I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real FBI.  This one's a fake. I'm a cop, you asshole!  What did you expect me to do?  Pretend all this never happened? Benza's over.  You're over.  I just want to take my family home. Why...?"
fracture,WILLY ,Ryan Gosling," Mrs. Demello?  MRS. DEMELLO!    Your CAR! Silence. He sighs.    Shuts the door and presses a button near the light-switch. There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves. He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries across the apartment to duck out under the closing door. Come on, Phil: I called you as a courtesy, and you start looking to take advantage? I'm not knocking it down to a Class C. My backlog of open cases does not mitigate the fact that your client tried to kill his brother-in-law with - oh, right, a ""golfing accident""? Your client owns one golf club and no golf balls - and the ""accident"" took place in the stairway of an illegal after- hours gambling club. Yeah, okay - I'll see you in court. His cell phone rings.   As he gets it: Well, I won't see you in court, but someone from this office will. You take it up with them, I gotta go.  Willy Slocum. Oh - hey, hi, yes. Assistant District Attorney NORMAN CHANG  throws the door open without looking: No, I didn't.     Wow.   Okay. Norman mouths ""WOOTON SIMS?!"" repeatedly during: No - short notice is...fine. No, I can. Black tie. Sure. What time? Okay. Yes. Thank her. He hangs up, exhales slowly.    Looks at Norman. Please stop saying, ""Wooton Sims"" over and over. It's starting to sound like nonsense words. Okay: go back to ""Wooton Sims."" As Willy gets up and goes out, past Norman - We're just going to pretend he's not talking, okay? I'm really jammed-up all day, and I need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight.  There must be a place that does that, right - same day? I'm also gonna need a messenger to bring it here. This is my suit size and my shirt size...I really appreciate this. Mona nods, taking notes as Willy gets out a credit card. Other DDAs are gathering to soak up some vicarious kicks. Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats to this charity opera thing every year, because Bob Wooton is the chairman of this committee -  It's what the man told me to call him. A style. I don't know - I just don't want to look like I'm going to the prom. Oh, that's very nice: it's good to be back in high school.  Our God? Yes sir. Thank you. I offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else's possible convictions. They couldn't handle their workloads, and I prefer not to lose. Lobruto knew this; the question was would Willy admit it. Sir? In two weeks. My mother didn't have a maiden name. Lobruto nods, unruffled by Willy's hard calm. I didn't work this hard to stay where I belong. I appreciate the offer. No, I think that's everything - thank you. Willy Slocum. Three o'clock is in fifteen minutes. I can't do it. Just get somebody else for this one.  A real confession? Okay.   Here's the problem. Sorry, your honor.    Long story. Willy, hurrying to Prosecution Table, barely glances at the Defense Table - - but Crawford, sitting beside his PUBLIC DEFENDER in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, never takes his eyes off Willy, intrigued. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, your honor: we've got the weapon and a signed confession. I really think Mr. Crawford needs a competent attorney to - frankly - negotiate a plea. Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an imaginary bow-tie. Willy self-consciously touches where Crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip- on. I - can't - this was supposed to be - with a pro se defendant, this is going to drag out for months - and I'm not even going to be here. The People request a continuance to - Terrific. All due respect, your honor, I'm worried this may turn into some sort of a - circus - Sure.   Why not. Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar. Is that what I'm supposed to be? I'm sorry to...disappoint you. Nunally is silent - frustrated. The concrete walls and ceilings echo from distant cars. And now you want mine? Are you all right? Yeah.  I'm on it.  You got a confession. You took the gun out of his hand. It's done. No.   It's okay. Willy waits.    Watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons. Sorry? If I stopped, I'd be standing around with no one to talk to. At which point, death would be a relief. ""Bob"" is talking to the Governor.  Do I know you? She puts a hand out, gently amused.  Oh - hey, hi. It was your office that called, with the invitation. Listen, I don't...actually know ""Bob."" I mean, I've only met the man once. Nikki nods, considering this.      And him. Truth is, I haven't really had that much expos- Kind of like a mentor. Okay. You're trying to scare me. You're going to have to try harder. She stops walking.   Studying Willy. Sure. It was a good bust, so Calvin came to me for a deal. I told him if he could arrange an interview for me with Mr. Wooton, I would throw the case. I laid out his arguments and evidence for him - and I showed him how I would lose. Calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date. Then he did what I had suggested in court - and I wiped the floor with him. Your client got the maximum. Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton.  Bob. Beat. Yes. Well - I wasn't entirely honest with Calvin. His cell-phone rings.    He ignores it. Everyone I need to talk to is here. They are both feeling the electricity in the air between them. They wait the phone out, enjoying the forbidden insanity of it. But then: All right. No problem. She studies Willy, trying to make sure he understands: I'm good at trials.    Even by fire. Beat. I'm looking forward to when I can afford the luxury of having some. Nikki sighs, smiles.    Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantly. Thanks.    Boss. He watches her head off into the night. He remains, alone, in his tuxedo, looking at the elegant glittering arts plaza. Then he checks his cell-phone.     Dials. It's Willy Slocum.     What's up? How can the gun be ""no good""? It's the gun from the scene? And between the shooting and arrest, this guy was locked inside his house. No, I mean, just: what's the point? Playing games with the gun. He's alone in the house with the victim, and he confessed - it's not like the gun's gonna get him off the hook. Look, our weapon is in that house somewhere. Get a team out to search it tomorrow morning.  Thank you. He shuts the phone. Takes a moment, looking around again at where he is. Absently tugs at his tie and vest, lets the case go. Heads in to the opera. Yeah. The idea here is we're trying to take boxes out - not bring more in. Whoa - wait a second, this is a screw- up. I already have these documents. I sent this box: to the Defendant, at County. Where are we on this gun? I'm in trial on Monday. You said you'd get a team out a week ago - Do I need it?! The weapon?! He takes a second.   Sighs, exasperated - but honest: I don't know. Probably not. Defendant's a whack-job. Yeah. Just when you think they're not really stupid, they defend themselves. Yeah, okay. Don't worry about it.  Sorry - got a lot going on. Hey, I had to sit through an opera last week. I don't know. Not yet. I beg your pardon? What the hell have you been doing. Not to investigate me! You shot your wife. Look - I don't want to play games with you. Is this some form of - communication? It's called Discovery.       The State has a legal obliga- Not yet.  No. Crawford nods.    Pleased.    Leans forward. I'm - prosecuting you. Are you out of your mind? I don't need the gun to convict you, by the way. It doesn't matter what she did...Tom. What you did is a crime. Great.   Take the stand. Tell your story.   I'd appreciate it. Except your confession. Crawford watches him go to the door. Is this gonna be about how you had a rough childhood? Looking for mine? Illuminate me. Crawford considers how to put it. Huh. Well.      Joke's on me then, I guess. I'll see you in court, Mr. Crawford. Just want to be ready for Chicago. I'm all closed-out, downtown. Last trial starts Monday. Beat.   Not pleased: Yeah: attempted murder. The man confessed.    And he's pro se. You want to hear his witness list? Nikki nods.   Willy is silent.     She frowns. It's kind of clever: this guy is trying to provoke the system into declaring him insane. I think he thinks we'll call in the doctors and he can fake 'em out by refusing the defense. He's acting out this really - organized plan to appear crazy. Beat.   Nikki considers Willy. I'm almost halfway through these. And I think I've already found about six disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and Florida. I have to check case law in each state, but it looks good. I'll get the rest done over the long weekend. Nikki sighs, smiles a little, against her will.      He's won her over...again. Willy shrugs, grins.    In the silence, the impossible electricity returns.    After a moment - to defuse it: No. She studies him a moment, thoughtful.    Careful. Really? She nods. Smiling a little, knowing her family and starting to know Willy: Yeah.    Okay, thank you. So the house was completely surrounded within how long of the first shots? Crawford sits alone at the Defense Table. He wears an expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two DEPUTIES sit behind him. He's barely listening to the testimony - drawing on his legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of ""Rube Goldberg"" contraptions. And when you arrived at the sc- Crawford noisily tears a page off his pad.     Looks up - sees Willy, and everyone else, turned to him. When you arrived on the scene, was there a crowd? And from what you could ascertain, no one went into or came out of the house until SWAT and the negotiator arrived? Thank you.   No further questions. So this bullet inflicted serious injury? Dr. Kang, is it safe to say that someone inflicting this kind of wound intended to kill? Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look. Thank you, Dr. Kang. Crawford tears off the page, starts another. So after you put down your gun, what did Mr. Crawford do? He confessed.  Did Mr. Crawford appear confused or in any way intoxicated, impaired? What did Mr. Crawford say? Nunally looks at Crawford, enjoying the fatal blow: Your honor - Your honor -  Oh - shit. Your honor... Your honor, the People request a - Nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail to attack Crawford - as the Deputies leap forward to stop him - all of them flailing and cursing in a tangle - He had my witness list.   He should have filed to suppress. I don't know. I only heard about it five minutes ago. We can't put him back on now! Not after what the jury just saw. Your honor, I told you this would turn into a circus. First he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation - Okay - um: I'll stipulate that my witness was less than forthcoming ...and that can more or less cancel out the fact that the defendant withheld a crucial - No way.   Your honor - Oh - come on!  You want to get into it?! Crawford raises his eyebrows. Awkward silence.         Willy takes a deep breath. Turns to the Judge. Sorry.  He dictated and signed his confession, after that incident. This is insane! He set this up! Don't you see what he's doing?! Willy Slocum. Do I? Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out what that is. No. I let him? I can't just - walk away. I guess...that would be the smart way of looking at it. No. Thank you. I've got some stuff to take care of. I won't. He hangs up.    Considering the empty eggshell.       But then he looks up: District Attorney Lobruto is in his office doorway, trying to decide whether to be angry. He - threw me off.  Look, Crawford knew he'd be the prime suspect, so he gave us everything - but he made it all radioactive. The night this went down, it was over. Are you taking me off? I'm starting to get a sense of this guy. I can take him now: he thinks he's smarter than I am. Yeah, it is. He made it that way.  He likes me. Let me do this. I won't make you look bad. Beat. If I lose. You said ""when."" Lobruto grimaces.     He shakes his head.    Sighs. You're not easy to find.      I had to call Internal Affairs. What the hell were you thinking. You're on the job and you get called to your girlfriend's house - It was her name! Did you get the feeling she had rules because she had done it before? With other guys? You were supposed to tell me! You thought nobody knew - so maybe you could just walk away clean. Yeah?   Well, he's not. Nunally won't look at Willy.      He just sits there, numb. Is there anything else you can give me. Anything that might get us some evidence. Nunally shakes his head.      Willy grimaces.   Goes to the door. You warned me he was smart. You didn't warn me you were stupid. Nunally winces. Takes it. Willy feels a little badly.         Two guys in a shabby motel room, in terrible trouble. We don't. Shake the boxes. The cereal boxes - shake 'em. And there's a chicken in the freezer. Thaw it out, check inside. The Deputy stares like he's nuts. Willy doesn't blink.    The Deputy goes to shake the boxes, eyes on Willy: okay? Willy nods.   Moves on. The garage?    Washer-dryer? What about the door frames?    The floors? What about the neighbors' property? He could have thrown it over the hedges. This isn't an accomplice sort of guy. He slows. Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg device. As he moves toward it: This is a...guy who likes to show off. He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the clutter of metal and wires and motors. Checks Marchand - who shakes his head. You sure? It's a physical object. It can't just vanish. We're missing something - some step in the story. He begins walking through the crime, ""the stations of the cross"" - re-enacting it, starting from the front door, methodical, reciting it to himself: The neighbor sees her get home. He's already inside. She lets herself in. A minute or two later: blood-pattern says she's standing over there - he's somewhere around here. Willy stands where Crawford was.     Raises a finger-gun. Boom. As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell: Because he's gonna need time. To confess. When she's alone with the cop. Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood, the discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers. Crawford shouts, ""Leave us alone"" and fires three more rounds: boom-boom- boom. So they'll call the Negotiator.  Now he's got about ten minutes. And that's it. He stands there with the imaginary gun in his hand. Looking around. Trying to think like Crawford. He can't. Do you dare stay out? Do you dare go in? Studying framed photos: Jennifer - now and then with Crawford - in Italy, Bermuda, Colorado. Always a bit posed and formal when they're together. And IF you go in - Should you turn left or right? Or right and three-quarters? Or maybe not quite. You can get so confused that you'll start in to race, Down long wiggled roads at break- necking pace No longer really looking for the gun.   He's looking for insight. Contact. A way in. And grind on for miles across weirdish wild space, Headed I fear, toward a most useless place. He idly surveys the vanity, cluttered with cosmetics, skin- care products. Lifts her perfume, sniffs. The Waiting Place... For people just waiting. Waiting for a train to go Or a bus to come, or a plane to go Notices a storage box on the floor, left partly-open in the search. He shifts the lid aside. Or the mail to come, or the rain to go Or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow A high-school yearbook. An old photo album. A teddy bear. A snow-globe. A well-worn book by Dr. Seuss. Or waiting around for a Yes or No Or waiting for their hair to grow. Everyone is just waiting. Willy stares down at the souvenirs of a lost life. Waiting for the fish to bite Or waiting for wind to fly a kite Or waiting around for Friday night Or waiting perhaps for their Uncle Jake Jennifer Crawford lies with her head wrapped in gauze, eyes shut, plastic tubing down her throat held in place with tape. Willy sits beside her bed, reading Dr. Seuss: Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break Or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants Or a wig with curls... Or Another Chance. He stops reading a moment.   Watching her: I heard it might - help - if somebody talked to her.  The man who shot her. The RESIDENT looks up at Willy - who shrugs, uncomfortable. Is there any chance...she might come out of this?  Sorry. I'm with the District Attorney's office.  We don't have any other witnesses. I know. But you hear about people waking up from comas. After everybody said pull the plug - they wake up.  You hear stuff like that all the time. It's not impossible, though. Is it? I mean - why else are you keeping her like this? Beat.   The Resident sighs. When I was here alone before, she moved a little. That's how it works with the law. So this is all exactly how he left it. And he was - distraught. But he was working on this. He stands over unfinished Rube Goldberg device.   Tools laid out on the work table - meticulous, organized. All distraught and everything. It's not evidence. Tell him I said no thank you. How long do you keep the tapes? Can I get a copy of October 9th? I'm kind of under the gun here. Right.   Okay. Anything is fine, your honor. So - is everyone in this family involved in the law? I don't think so, sir.  It's where the money is. Times have changed. I don't mind; I get this kind of thing now and then.  Almost always from people with money. My mom OD'd fairly frequently, so they put me in a Group Home. My younger sister is dead and my older brother is doing twenty-five-to-life. I usually do. It's not over 'til it's over. I wasn't. Nikki looks at Willy. Taken off. I asked him not to. Silence.   Nikki is staring at him.    Angry. I'm - getting new evidence - Did it ever occur to you I might be good enough to still win?! The man shot his - Yeah, I'm just - Look - I'm sorry - can we not talk about this here?! Nikki stops. Refusing to look around.     Ashamed at losing control, turns back to her food: Thank you. Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses down her napkin: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you - Wouldn't it be better than damage control if I actually turn it around? What am I supposed to do? Yeah.   Okay. Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The impossible feelings always running under the surface for them have developed a darker, aching tone. If anything, stronger. I think maybe I'm gonna go now. I've got some work to do. I need to call a cab. Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet. Studying the torn-up young man. Shit! - by Nunally, on the other side of the glass. Catching his breath, Willy stares. He unlocks the French doors and Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard. The hell are you doing here? Nunally looks around - taking a pint bottle from his overcoat pocket, uncapping it. Thank you, Professor Einstein. It would also be good to find a couple of eyewitnesses. If one could be the Dalai Lama, it would be even better. I've had three different teams here - Well - we can't! You want to move on? Nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat - - Willy catches it.       A Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter in a plastic bag. Willy stares down at it. Then at Nunally, who holds up: a bullet, deformed by impact. It's a crime. Go home. I'll find a way. Guns don't just walk out of crime scenes. Marchand waves copies of Crawford's evidence - stills printed from home-video Dick took at a hostage negotiation: Nunally doing his job, his methods, his routine. Then what is this: Willy uses the remote. On the TV, in black-and-white: Jennifer and Nunally come out of their room and head for the pool - indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on fast-forward - - until he slows it: Crawford comes to let himself in. Hotel surveillance.     From that day. He was there. Why? Marchand watches over Willy's shoulder.    Shrugs. See what?     They were out at the pool. Yeah.     Worked up. Marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on. Yeah.  Maybe.  Can I ask you to do something for me this morning? Write down your cell number.  Once my trial is in session, wait outside. I might call - and just hang up. If I do, I want you to come into court and whisper to me that we got a tip about the murder weapon. I haven't decided yet. Mona studies Willy - then accepts it's don't-ask-don't-tell, hands him her number. Willy nods, grateful. Turning for the door, she remembers the envelope in her hand. So - between the time you heard the first gunshot and called 911, and the time of Mr. Crawford's arrest - you had the Crawford house in view? No one but Thomas Crawford came in or out? Thank you, Mr. Gifford.    No further questions. Re-direct, your honor. But Crawford is standing too - with his handful of pages: Objection - I'm on re-direct! The Judge hesitates.   Both men standing. I'm in the middle of presenting - May I have a moment, your honor? The Judge nods. Willy nods down. Trying to focus. He's got nothing, and everyone in the room knows it. He can hear it, he can feel it. There's a restless, hungry edge to the crowded courtroom. He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone. Next to it: the first class ticket and Nikki's note. Willy glances back at the gallery. Nunally's eyes burn into him. In the back: Lobruto frowns, concerned. I have no further evidence at this time, your honor. Crawford begins to smile. Lobruto looks down.    A buzz rises in the gallery - - as Nunally gets up, furious - stalks to the doors, slams out.  Hey. I don't know what I thought. Awkward silence.      She tries to get past it: Hang on - We move with Willy as he shuts the phone and heads for the doors - faster, pushing out - Your husband said something...that I can't seem to shake loose of. He said I'm a winner.  And he's right. I can't lose. I can't stand people who lose.  I may have been working so hard to put some distance between me and...people like you - that maybe I messed up. I don't know if did anything wrong. Or what I should have done. I really don't know, any more...what I'm supposed to do.  But I feel like I let you down. Somehow in the...process. And if I did, I'm sorry. That's all. I just - I hope you...have...just, some...  Anyway. He feels stupid. Takes a breath.     Looking at her pale, drawn, comatose face. He stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by the door. Pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs. Gets his briefcase. She was looking at me. No, she was looking at me. She's reacting. The Resident ignores him. Pricks her forehead - her chin - her big toe. Each time she twitches. He runs his thumb along the sole of Jennifer's bare foot. It arches up. You see? She's in there. She was looking at me. Can we do other tests? Like an M.R.I. or something? And I want a coma specialist to see her. I'll get you authorization.      First thing tomorrow. The Resident studies Willy.   Reluctantly: Just...visiting. No? Oh - right. That's my weak spot.  Ever think about what yours might be? Your flaw? You sure do know a lot, though. Got everybody all figured out, everything set up, like one of your contraptions. Then you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to. Must be kind of...boring. At that point. But you had to, right? You needed time to set it all up...your ""crime of passion."" Yeah.  There are.  So - thank you. Crawford frowns.     Starting to feel wary.   Willy sees it. Enjoys it. For sharing your wisdom. All your little helpful bits of information.  You were right. Talking to her. Beat.   Willy winks.    He goes past Crawford and out the doors. Crawford doesn't move - except to turn and watch Willy. Uncertain, for the first time since we've met him. Hi, I'm just - - going directly to the key-card slot by the glass double- doors to the rest of the floor. He swipes his card and pulls the handle - - but it stays locked.     Willy swipes his card again.   No go. Excuse me - I'm new, I just started - and there's something wrong with my card. Can you buzz me in? I work here.    Willy Slocum.    I'm new - He stops, realizing how he must look. Nikki Gardner. Willy Slocum, for Nikki Gardner. As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of a half-dozen ASSOCIATES trailing in the wake of BOB WOOTON. They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton - who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older. Wait a second - never mind, here she is, thank you. Willy goes toward the glass doors as Wooton comes through - nodding deferentially to the boss, semi-apologetic: Hey...Bob -  Can I talk to you for a second? Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take long. She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators - staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy: You let him know what happened last night? Great - who do I work with on it while you're gone? Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney and a health-care proxy, he can disconnect her life-support whenever he wants. If we don't move fast - Nikki explodes - but quietly, not wanting the team to hear: I told you - we bring a civil suit - It doesn't have to stick: we just need to get a court order for now - to keep Crawford from pulling the plug! With all the brain-power here, I'm sure somebody can come up with a pretext or call in a favor. Then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a state- appointed conservatorship - so we can protect her while we fight him on - The point?! Willy stares. Because she's drawn a line in the sand. One he already crossed, without truly understanding...and now he's standing out there alone - feeling the sand slither away under his feet. This man is going to kill his wife. No, this is insane. You're not really just gonna let this happen, are you?! My problems?! Wait a second - this is not about my anything any more - Willy grabs Nikki's arm to stop her, turn her around - and she shoves him away, hard, tears welling in her eyes - - Willy letting her go - as the Receptionist quietly calls for help - - and Nikki hurries into the waiting elevator.     The Associate holding the doors lets them go. This is about taking a couple of goddamn weeks off to try and save a woman's life! The doors begin to close. Willy stands facing the cluster of lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging from pity to contempt - - except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and defensive anger. As the doors shut across them. Willy doesn't move.     Confused, humiliated, frustrated. He turns when a bunch of OTHER LAWYERS emerge from the offices, ready to act as bouncers. People gawk from behind the glass doors. Beat.   Willy holds up his palms. Don't bother.     I got it. People wake up out of these things. They said...there's no way to really know. I'm trying to get them to run more tests - but I was there, and I'm telling you. I'm sorry - but nobody else seems to give a damn that sooner or later this guy is gonna finish what he started. Beat. No - I've been trying to get some- What? Against me. Can you do anything for her? Beat. Can I use your fax machine? Move it if you need to! - running through the automatic doors. What? How long ago...did she die? He's - moving her by helicopter? Then just hold it - for a couple of hours! Have it inspected! She's not gonna get there! He looks at Crawford: reading - amused, thoughtful. This man is a mechanical engineer with expertise in air crashes! He has access to airfields and he knows exactly how to make it look like an accident! You know what he did! You know why she's like this! Lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt. Crawford checks his watch.   Looks into Willy's eyes - - then gestures for Willy to join him, and turns back to walk across the pad to the helicopter. Climbs in. Willy stares, stunned. Lunt looks at him: case closed. The rotors whirl faster, engine noise rising to a scream. From the open chopper doorway, Crawford looks at Willy again and gestures for him to get on. Willy doesn't know how to react.   Slowly, he starts to walk toward the helicopter. Why are we going out over the ocean? We have to turn back! He's doing something - we have to turn back! He is!   You have to get us DOWN! I'm TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK! He's DOING SOMETH- An alarm begins to shriek - on the ventilator. Everyone turns as the Med Tech hastily kneels next to it - What's happening?! What is it? What? The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared. There's a restraining order - she's protected - I'm authorizing you to do it! The Med Tech turns to Crawford, uncertain - Wait!    WAIT - LOOK! Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked - - as the Med Tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the Med Tech taking her pulse - Willy, staring down at her, intent: She's breathing. Yes.     Yes. Willy whirls around to Crawford.        Who's frowning. You messed up. With all your plans and games. Willy turns back to Jennifer. Delicately strokes the side of her face. Her eyes flutter open - Shhhh.    It's okay.       It's all right. - she stares into Willy's eyes. He takes her hand.        Silent awe in her eyes. Yearning. Fear. You're gonna be okay? She squeezes his hand.      Very weakly. Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch. Jennifer's eyes - fixed on Willy - roll back.        She fights it. Jennifer?       Hang on. Something sad in her wordless gaze.        As it starts to fade. Jennifer?!     JENNIFER?! She's slipping. Her eyes gone empty.        Her hand becoming lifeless in his. No.     Come on, Jennifer.    Fight back. Tears well up in Willy's eyes, but he struggles against them - feeling Crawford's gaze, refusing him the satisfaction. Don't let go. But she's gone. He stares down. Mourning her. Letting his grief slowly burn into rage. He gently reaches up and closes her eyes. Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically. That's kind of an answer in itself, isn't it? Willy heads back in, starts to pack again. Haven't decided yet.    Just someplace else. Lobruto nods.   Willy packs. Yep. That's not what I was doing. I need to - get to know myself better. I didn't just lose a case!     I let a man get away with murder. Lobruto nods. Respecting his pain.     Shrugs, accepts the decision, with regret. Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing. Lobruto starts to leave.    But from the alley door: His wife is dead! Lobruto turns.   Uncertain what Willy is getting at. We can still get him.    We can take him back to court. Double jeopardy doesn't apply! We bring a new charge - of homicide. No: he shot her and she died. The fact that it took time - the fact that he went to trial in between, just for shooting her - doesn't matter. He fired a gun and caused her death, and that's murder.  If he can twist the law around - then so can we. Lobruto thinks it out.    Wary. A man burns down a house; we charge him with arson. There were people sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in the hospital, they die. We'd charge him with murder. Right? Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now.         Impressed with the young man's fervor, and his logic. But he shakes his head. I'll get something new. You don't want to know. I don't work for you.  Right? Beat. Lobruto sighs, as Willy nods and turns to start back to the garage. With work to do. What else have we got left? Willy disappears inside. I need a favor. Uh-huh. The Clerk stops, checking a number against a slip of paper in his hand - pulls down a box for Willy. You ain't seen nothin' yet. He presses the POLICE emergency button, then turns to Crawford. I want the gun. I want the gun you shot your wife with. Now. Crawford doesn't move. Willy raises his gun, points it at Crawford's face. One way or another, I'm going to see to it you receive justice tonight. Crawford studies Willy. Oh, yes. Gonna be a whole lot less funny in about a minute. Crawford nods.    Considering the game.   Unruffled. I don't work for the D.A. any more. I'm just a guy who broke into your house. When the police arrest me - they'll inventory anything in my possession. If that happens to be crucial evidence in another case, well: some prosecutor just got lucky. Silence. Crawford studies Willy's eyes, over the muzzle of the gun between them. I guess you'd know that. You don't know me.  It's Nunally's. Crawford is thrown by this - but conceals it well. Yeah.    Really. He has backed himself into a corner, and he's getting scared. Because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake Crawford out with - - is starting to seem like his only way out. Even Crawford sees it. In Willy's eyes. The uncertain edge of the idea. He could just do it. End the game. Blow Crawford's brains all over the wall. There I was, with a perfectly good weapon just sitting in the evidence warehouse. It would be so easy. With his life already a shambles.   With everything already lost. At least he would have this. I th"

magnolia,JIM KURRING ,John C. Reilly," Well, hello.  This is Jim.  I work in Law Enforcement.  I am an officer for the L.A.P.D. and I work out of the Van Nuys district.  I love my job, and I love to go to the movies.  I try to stay pyhsically fit, my job demands it, so I'm in pretty good shape. I'm gettin' up there, though: I'm 32 years old and I'm six feet two inches tall and I weigh about 160. I'm really interested in meeting someone special who likes quiet things.....my life is very stressful and I'd hope to have a relationship that is very calm and undemanding and loving -- This is not an easy job.  I get a call from Shirley on the radio: Bad News. It's never good news.  She tries to be cheerful, tries to say something nice, but uh-huh, it's just Bad News. And It Stinks.  But this is my job. And I Love It.  Because I want to do well. In this life and in this world I want to do well.  And I want to help people. And I may get twenty bad calls a day. But one time I help someone, I Make A Save? I correct a wrong or right a situation; Then I'm a happy cop.  And We Move Through This Life We Should Try And Do Good. ...Do Good.  And If We Can Do That...And Not Hurt Anyone Else.....Well, Then.... Hello? Quietly, slow down, whoa -- The door was open, I got a call -- Calm down. I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance -- I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on -- Then you've got nothin' to worry about. Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down. You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here? No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here? No one else in here? OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house? Are you lyin' to me? Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now? Ok. What's your name? Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me? I'm not askin', Marcie. Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash. And what about screaming? What's this, how did this happen? You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks? Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something. Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here. Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today? You on any medication? Been drinkin' today? --- What was that? No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch -- Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay -- This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air -- This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up -- Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now -- -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now. Marcie - Do not drag that couch any further! What the hell is this Marcie? 10-4. I think it's more complicated than that little man. You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok? Sorry, little man. Why the hell aren't you in school? They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school? That's confidential information, little man. No Can Do. Ok. Listen. You: c'mere. You wanna disrespect an officer of the law? Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes? Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract? Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall? Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it. Go. Hurry up. Let's go. -- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word -- Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language. Finish it up without the lip. Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T. I was listening -- -- and I'm through playin' games. LAPD. Open the door. It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please? OPEN THE DOOR. ...yeah... -- you the resident here? You alone in there? No one else in there with you? You mind if I come in, check things? Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok? You live alone? What's your name? Claudia What? Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf? Did you hear what I said? -- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears? Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears. And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand? You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually? Have you been drinkin' today, doin' some drugs? I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling? Was it a boyfriend of yours? You don't have a boyfriend? Who was it? You mind if I check things back here? Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok? You just move in here? Bit messy. I'm a bit of a slob myself. You and your boyfriend have a party last night? got some coffee brewing, huh? I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup -- That's great, thank you. Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia. That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok? Arlight, then.  Cheers. Is this boyfriend bothering you? The gentleman who came to the door -- Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 -- It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take -- I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance. But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face! Okey-doke. This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia -- What's that stand for? This is my job. Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee -- No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now. Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright? Just Jim. Bye, bye, Claudia. I'm sorry, Claudia. No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date. Please, yes. No. I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door. Yeah. No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time? What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then -- No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night -- Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's? Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock. Bye. ...it's not going to stop...it's not going to stop 'till you wise up..."" Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them -- Well I don't go out very much. I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with. No, no. ok. ...yeah... Let's make a deal. Wow....huh...""...piss and shit..."" You really use strong language. -- no, no, it's fine. Fine. It's fine. ...nothing.  I'm sorry... -- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much -- ok. Well. Yeah. Yeah, of course. -- no, like what, what do you mean? I lost my gun. I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me. I'm sorry -- I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you.... It's ok. It's ok. I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you. Say what you want and you'll see -- Yes I do. What? I won't say, no, wait, Claudia -- please, what is it, please -- YOU'RE OK...you're gonna be ok.... ...these security systems can be a real joke. I mean, a frog falls from the sky and lands on the x-4 box 'round back and opens all the doors? Triggers a siutation?  You don't know who could be driving by at any moment, walk in and rob the place -- I was you I'd talk to your boss about a new security system -- You guys make alotta money, huh? I got a buddy a mine down at the med. center, he'd probably do quite a deal on a set of dentures, you're interested in that.  He's in training, you know he's not a dentist yet, but he's real good at corrective oral surgery from what I understand... ...alot of people think this is just a job that you go to.....take a lunch hour, the jobs over, something like that. But...it's a 24 hour deal...no two ways about it....and what most people don't see:  Just How Hard It Is To Do The Right Thing.  People think if I make a judgment call that it's a judgment on them...but that's not what I do and that's not what should be done...I have to take everything and play it as it lays. Sometimes people need a little help. Sometimes people need to be forgiven and sometimes they need to go to jail. And that's a very tricky thing on my part...making that call...the law is the law and heck if I'm gonna break it...but you can forgive someone....?  Well, that's the tough part....What Do We Forgive? Tough part of the job.....tough part of walking down the street..."
shivers,ST. LUC ,Paul Hampton,"  Sure. Yes. No, nothing. I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic. Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today. It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come. He sounded fine. You touch my spleen, Rollo. (they giggle at an old medical-school reference) And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy. Well, at least you still talk the same. But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?  Did I say anything?  It's crazy. I don't get it. Rollo, how come Hobbes killed himself?  Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP. You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat. Who was she? Well, Rollo Linsky... I gotta go open up the store. It's been great to see you again. OK. I'll think about it. Well, there's certainly nothing here in this check-up I did for your husband's company last year. Blood pressure a touch high, cholesterol count nice and low... (looking Janine in the eye) I just can't see cancer developing that fast, Janine, not the way you've described it. Could be swollen glands or something, I don't know.  If he can't make it down here... sure. That's what I'm here for. But it won't be until, oh...  ...9.30, say 10.00. OK? Not too late? Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec. Just breathe normally.  Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady? Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor? Was this girl from Starliner Towers? Was her name Annabelle Horsefield? OK, you can get dressed now, Mr. Parkins.  I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology. Well, let's wait for the X-rays. OK, Dotty. Everything else seems to be fine. Now if it gives you any trouble at all, any sharp pain, any unusual discharge, you come and see me right away. They can be tricky sometimes. That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks. Uh, OK. Sure. C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list? Yes?  Yes? Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you. Been glancing at some of your publications on your work with Hobbes. No? How come? OK, I bite. What does it look like? I don't get it. He didn't make it. Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list. I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?  Yeah? What do I do then? OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly. Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while. No. I don't think so. OK. But late. Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened? Where is he now? Do you know? Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is. OK, c'mon. What happened? Where is this thing that attacked your wife?  This is Nurse Forsythe. She's a nurse, you understand me? Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?  OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?  Down to the incinerator. It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.  Rollo'll be here soon. Rollo'll be here soon. Can you walk? I couldn't find anything wrong with you. Rollo and the police should be here by now. It's just a question of avoiding infected residents until we find them.  Forsythe! Forsythe! Have you seen the police? I'm Dr. St. Luc. Have you seen the police? Have they come?"
lincoln,LINCOLN ,Joseph Gordon-Levitt," What's your name, soldier?  How long've you been a soldier? Second Kansas Colored Infantry, they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry. I am aware of it, Corporal Clark. What'll you do after the war, Corporal Clark? Perhaps I will. I've yet to find a man could cut mine so it'd make any difference. Yes, I do. My last barber hanged himself. And the one before that. Left me his scissors in his will. Could you hear what I said? That's good, thank you for - Thank you, that's -  You fellas best find your company. God bless you. It's nighttime. The ship's moved by some terrible power, at a terrific speed. Though it's imperceptible in the darkness, I have an intuition that we're headed towards a shore. No one else seems to be aboard the vessel. I'm alone. I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space...were it not that I have bad dreams. I reckon it's the speed that's strange to me. I'm used to going a deliberate pace. I should spare you. I shouldn't tell you my dreams.  How's the coconut? I do. It was most probably an - How's the plans for the big shindy progressing? Not much but they're a necessary -  Don't spend too much money on the flubdubs. It's late, Mrs. Keckley. Good night. Hmm?  Me too, Taddie. But we can't. Willie's gone. Three years now. He's gone. The part assigned to me is to raise the flag, which, if there be no fault in the machinery, I will do, and when up, it will be for the people to keep it up. That's my speech. Only twenty. We can find twenty votes. To which I always listen. With all three of my ears. Ain't won yit. I like our chances now. Fifty-six. Since the House last voted on the amendment there's been an election. Sixty-four Democrats lost their House seats in November. That's sixty-four Democrats looking for work come March. I said nothing of buying anything. We need twenty votes was all I said. Start of my second term, plenty of positions to fill. Mr. Jolly. Ma'am. This by the fire's Secretary of State Seward. Jeff City. I heard tell once of a Jefferson City lawyer who had a parrot that'd wake him each morning crying out, ""Today is the day the world shall end, as scripture has foretold."" And one day the lawyer shot him for the sake of peace and quiet, I presume, thus fulfilling, for the bird at least, its prophecy! That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly. Just tell me what you want from me. Jeff City? That's, uh, Congressman Burton?  Republican. Undecided on the question of the amendment, I believe. Perhaps you could call on him and inform him of your enthusiasm.  Would you let me study this letter, sir, about the tollbooth? Come back to me in the morning and we'll consider what the law says. And be sure to visit ""Beanpole"" and tell him that you support passage of the Amendment. As a military necessity. Oh, Nicolay? When you have a moment. Pardon me, that's a distress signal, which I am bound by solemn oath to respond to. You had nightmares all night, mama's right to - Perhaps. Send over to Blair House. Ask Preston Blair can I call on him around five o'clock. If the Blairs tell `em to, no Republican will balk at voting for the amendment. Yes, sir, I do. He spends his days with soldiers.  Thunder forth, God of War! It got took by a breeze several nights back.  Old Neptune! Shake thy hoary locks! Wilmington's their last open seaport. Therefore... I don't recall Bates being any too certain about the legality of my Proclamation, just it wasn't downright criminal. Somewhere's in between. Back when I rode the legal circuit in Illinois I defended a woman from Metamora named Melissa Goings, 77 years old, they said she murdered her husband; he was 83. He was choking her; and, uh, she grabbed ahold of a stick of fire- No one was keen to see her convicted, he was that kind of husband. I asked the prosecuting attorney if I might have a short conference with my client. And she and I went into a room in the courthouse, but I alone emerged. The window in the room was found to be wide open. It was believed the old lady may have climbed out of it. I told the bailiff right before I left her in the room she asked me where she could get a good drink of water, and I told her Tennessee. Mrs. Goings was seen no more in Metamora. Enough justice had been done; they even forgave the bondsman her bail. I decided that the Constitution gives me war powers, but no one knows just exactly what those powers are. Some say they don't exist. I don't know. I decided I needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the Constitution, which I decided meant that I could take the rebels' slaves from `em as property confiscated in war. That might recommend to suspicion that I agree with the rebs that their slaves are property in the first place. Of course I don't, never have, I'm glad to see any man free, and if calling a man property, or war contraband, does the trick... Why I caught at the opportunity. Now here's where it gets truly slippery. I use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments and Two years ago I proclaimed these people emancipated - ""then, thenceforward and forever free."" But let's say the courts decide I had no authority to do it. They might well decide that. Say there's no amendment abolishing slavery. Say it's after the war, and I can no longer use my war powers to just ignore the courts' decisions, like I sometimes felt I had to do. Might those people I freed be ordered back into slavery? That's why I'd like to get the Thirteenth Amendment through the House, and on As the preacher said, I could write shorter sermons but once I start I get too lazy to stop. Well, the people do that, I suppose. I signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half before my second election. I felt I was within my power to do it; however I also felt that I might be wrong about that; I knew the people would tell me. I gave `em a year and half to think about it. And they re- elected me.  And come February the first, I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment. Well, Mr. Representative Ashley! Tell us the news from the Hill. Why for instance is this thus, and what is the reason for this thusness? We're whalers, Mr. Ashley! We've been chasing this whale for a long time. We've finally placed a harpoon in the monster's back. It's in, James, it's in! We finish the deed now, we can't wait! Or with one flop of his tail he'll smash the boat and send us all to eternity! I intend to, Preston. And in return, I must ask you - Not now! Oh. Bob. I'm sorry. Welcome home.  Just give us a moment please, Robert. Thank you.  I understand, Preston. Six. What'd Hawkins get? He's selling himself cheap, ain't he?  Time for my public opinion bath. Might as well let `em in. Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis! Thirteen to go! We'll hear `em out. The Blairs have promised support for the amendment if we listen to these people - What hope for any Democratic votes, Willum, if word gets out that I've refused a chance to end the war? You think word won't get out? In Washington? ""If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me..."" Time is a great thickener of things, Willum. Get me thirteen votes. (in a thick Kentucky ACCENT:) Them fellers from Richmond ain't here yit. It's a sturdy profession, and a useful one. I ain't wearing them things, Mr. Slade, they never fit right.  I've found that prophesying is one of life's less prophet-able occupations! Put `em back in the box. We'll return them to Mr. Gardner's studio day after next. Be careful with `em, now.  These things should've stayed on the calf. I know. Somehow you will. We didn't know how sick he was. Three years ago, the war was going so badly, and we had to put on a face. Molly. It's too hard. Too hard. Since we have the floor next in the debate, I thought I'd suggest you might...temper your contributions so as not to frighten our conservative friends? I can't ensure a single damn thing if you scare the whole House with talk of land appropriations and revolutionary tribunals and punitive thisses and thats - That's the untempered version of reconstruction. It's not... It's not exactly what I intend, but we shall oppose one another in the course of time. Now we're working together, and I'm asking you - When the people disagree, bringing them together requires going slow till they're ready to make up - I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens, and I have tried to profit from the example of it. But if I'd listened to you, I'd've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter; then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy, the war would've been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, in two weeks, we'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the American South into South America. A compass, I learnt when I was surveying, it'll - it'll point you True North from where you're standing, but it's got no advice Robert's going to plead with us to let him enlist. Tad's young. Plenty of boys younger than Robert signing up...  ""Come on out, you old rat!"" That's what Ethan Allen called to the commander of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. ""Come on out, you old rat!"" `Course there were only forty- odd redcoats at Ticonderoga. But, but there is one Ethan Allen story that I'm very partial to - It was right after the Revolution, right after peace had been concluded, and Ethan Allen went to London to help our new country conduct its business with the king. The English sneered at how rough we are, and rude and simple-minded and on like that, everywhere he went, till one day he was invited to the townhouse of a great English lord. Dinner was served, beverages imbibed, time passed, as happens, and Mr. Allen found he needed the Now, Mr. Allen discovered on entering the water closet that the only decoration therein was a portrait of George Washington. Ethan Allen done what he came to do and returned to the drawing room. His host and the others were disappointed when he didn't mention Washington's portrait. And finally His Lordship couldn't resist, and asked Mr. Allen had he noticed it, the picture of Washington. He had. Well, what did he think of its placement, did it seem appropriately located to Mr. Allen? Mr. Allen said it did. His host was astounded! Appropriate? George Washington's likeness in a water closet? Yes, said Mr. Allen, where it'll do good service: the whole world knows nothing'll make an Englishman shit quicker than the sight of George Washington. I love that story. After four years of war and near 600,000 lives lost. He believes we can end this war now. My trust in him is marrow deep. Now, here's a sixteen year old boy. They're going to hang him...  He was with the 15th Indiana Calvary near Beaufort, seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle. I don't think even Stanton would It's three forty in the morning. He oughtn't to have done that, crippled his horse, that was cruel, but you don't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that - - for cruelty. There'd be no sixteen year old boys left.  Grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to Washington.  He was afraid, that's all it was. I don't care to hang a boy for being frightened, either. What good would it do him? War's nearly done. Ain't that so? What use one more corpse? Any more corpses? Times like this, I'm best alone. ""Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, City Point. I have read your words with interest."" ""I ask that, regardless of any action I take in the matter of the visit of the Richmond commissioners, you maintain among your troops military preparedness for battle, as you have done until now."" ""Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington.""  ""A. Lincoln."" And the date.  You think we choose to be born? Are we fitted to the times we're born into?  What do you reckon? You're an engineer, you must know Euclid's axioms and common notions. I never had much of schooling, but I read Euclid, in an old book I borrowed. Little enough ever found its way in here -  - but once learnt it stayed learnt. That's a rule of mathematical reasoning. It's true because it works; has done and always will do. In his book, Euclid says this is ""self-evident.""  D'you see? There it is, even in that two-thousand year old book of mechanical law: it is a self- evident truth that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. We begin with equality. That's the origin, isn't it? That balance, that's fairness, that's justice. Read me the last sentence of my telegram. A slight emendation, Sam, if you would. ""Have Captain Saunders convey the gentlemen aboard the River Queen as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia, and there wait until...""  ""...further advice from me. Do not proceed to Washington."" You said you wanted to help me. She told me she didn't take you inside. At all rates, I'm happy to have your company. Morning, Jim. Good to see you again. Well, boys, first question: You getting enough to eat? What's your name, soldier? Robert. Good to meet you, Robert. What's your name? Tell me your names as I go past. I like to know who I'm talkin' to. Kevin. John. I've seen you before. What's the matter, Bob? That same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began? ""I don't need your damn permission, you miserable old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!"" And what wouldn't those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons - as I now say to mine - ""I'm commander-in-chief, so in point of fact, without my permission, you ain't enlisting in nothing, nowhere, young man."" We can't lose you. He'll be fine, Molly. City Point's far from the front lines, from the fighting, he'll be an adjutant running messages for General Grant. That's not true - Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln, I demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view! You imagine Robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition?! I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I couldn't permit it in myself, though I wanted to, Mary. I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin. I still do. Every day I do. Don't... talk to me about grief.  I must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours. And bear what we must, hold and carry what we must. What I carry within me - you must allow me to do it, alone as I must. And you alone, Mary, you alone may lighten this burden, or render it intolerable. As you choose. Seward doesn't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town. I don't envy him his task. He may wish He'd chosen an instrument for His purpose more wieldy than the House of Representatives. Are you afraid of what lies ahead? For your people? If we succeed? Many don't. I...I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley. Any of you. You're ...familiar to me, as all people are. Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked creatures such as we all are. You have a right to expect what I expect, and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other. I assume I'll get used to you. But what you are to the nation, what'll become of you once slavery's day is done, I don't know. I wouldn't bet against it, Mr...? Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen. The Secretary of State here tells me that, uh, you got eleven Democrats in the bag. That's encouraging. ""We have heard the chimes of midnight, Master Shallow."" I'm here to alert you boys that the great day of reckoning is nigh upon us. Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, willya? Snagged my eye in the paper this morning. Governor Curtin is set to declare a winner in the disputed Congressional election for the - What a joy to be comprehended. Hop on a train to Philadell, call on the Governor -  No, he'll do fine, just polish yourself up first. That's him. Now give me the names of whoever else you been hunting. I got it. I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman, filled with colored men in chains, heading down the Mississippi to the New Orleans slave markets. It sickened me, `n more than that, it brought a shadow down, a pall around my eyes.  Slavery troubled me, as long as I can remember, in a way it never troubled my father, though he hated it. In his own fashion. He knew no smallholding dirt farmer could compete with slave plantations. He took us out from Kentucky to get away from `em. He wanted Indiana kept free. He wasn't a kind man, but there was a rough moral urge for fairness, for freedom in him. I learnt that from him, I suppose, if little else from him. We didn't care for one another, Mr. Yeaman. Lovingkindness, that most ordinary thing, came to me from other sources. I'm grateful for that.  We're unready for peace too, ain't we? When it comes, it'll present us with conundrums and dangers greater than any we've faced during the war, bloody as it's been. We'll have to extemporize and experiment with what it is when it is. I read your speech, George. Negroes and the vote, that's a puzzle. I'm asking only that you disenthrall yourself from the slave powers. I'll let you know when there's an offer on my desk for surrender. There's none before us now. What's before us now, that's the vote on the Thirteenth Amendment. It's going to be so very close. You see what you can do. I'd change that in you if I could, but that's not why I come. I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I expect... Colored people will most likely be free, and when that's so, it's simple truth that your brother's bravery, and his death, helped make it so. Only you can decide whether that's sense enough for you, or not. My deepest sympathies to your family. I can't listen to this anymore! I can't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery and end this pestilential war, and whether any of you or anyone else knows it, I know I need this! This amendment is that cure! We're stepped out upon the world's stage now, now, with the fate of human dignity in our hands! Blood's been spilt to afford us this moment! Now now now! And you grousle and heckle and dodge about like pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters! See what is before you! See the here and now! That's the hardest thing, the only thing that accounts! Abolishing slavery by constitutional provision settles the fate, for all coming time, not only of the millions now in bondage but of unborn millions to come. Two votes stand in its way, and these votes must be procured. You got a night and a day and a night and several perfectly good hours! Now get the hell out of here and get `em! Buzzards' guts, man. I am the President of the United States of America, clothed in immense power! You will procure me these votes. This is precisely what Mr. Wood wishes me to respond to? Word for word? This is precisely the assurance that he demands of me? Give this to Mr. Ashley. Impeachable. I've made no false representation. Give me the note, Johnnie.  Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley. I'd like peace immediately. I'd like your states restored to their practical relations to the Union immediately.  We ain't here to discuss reconstruction, we have no legal basis for that discussion. But I don't want to deal falsely. The Northern states'll ratify, most of `em. As I figure, it remains for two of the Southern states to do the same, even after all are readmitted. And I been working on that. Arkansas too, most likely. It'll be ratified. Slavery, sir, it's done. If we submit ourselves to law, Alex, even submit to losing freedoms - the freedom to oppress, for instance - we may discover other freedoms previously unknown to us. Had you kept faith with democratic process, as frustrating as that can be - It may be you're right. But say all we done is show the world that democracy isn't chaos, that there is a great invisible strength in a people's union? Say we've shown that a people can endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere? Mightn't that save at least the idea of democracy, to aspire to? Eventually, to become worthy of? At all rates, whatever may be proven by blood and sacrifice must've been proved by now. Shall we stop this bleeding? Once he surrenders, send his boys back to their homes, their farms, their shops. Liberality all around. No punishment. I don't want that. And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of `em - if they escape, leave the country while my back's turned, that wouldn't upset me none. Some weariness has bit at my bones.  I never seen the like of it before. What I seen today. Never seen the like of it before. We've made it possible for one another to do terrible things. I'd like that. To the West by rail. The Holy Land. Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon walked. I dream of walking in that ancient city. Anyone thinks that doesn't understand, Molly. We must try to be happier. We must. Both of us. We've been so miserable for so long. I did say some colored men, the intelligent, the educated, and veterans, I qualified it. Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a better speech. Am I in trouble? Thank you, Mr. Slade. I suppose it's time to go, though I would rather stay. Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ""the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."" With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."
ted,JOHN ,Mark Wahlberg," Hey guys, can I play? Wow! He talks! I'm gonna name you Teddy. Hey Teddy... can I tell you something nobody knows? Last week, my mom and dad took me to the park for a picnic. And they have this duck pond there, and... when nobody was looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it at a duck. Was that mean?  I love you too, Teddy! You know... I wish you could really talk to me. Because then we could be best friends forever and ever. Teddy?  Teddy?! Teddy? Did you... did you just talk?  You're alive?! Whoa... Yeah, I... I did wish for it. You mean... we get to be best friends... for real? Forever and ever? Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear's alive! No mom, he's alive! For real! Look! BUT DAD-- Dad, no! The thunder can't get us, right? Teddy? Do you promise we'll always be together? Thunder buddies for life.  CONTINUED: That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's hot. They're not that bad. I-- It's workin' for me. Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints. Jesus, I don't know if I can drive. Aw, man. It's not good. Shit. I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. THOMAS What do you mean?  I guess I... wasn't really prepared for a follow-up question. Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me. N--no. No. I will, sir. Thank you. I won't let you down, Goose. Top Gun. Tom Skerritt. Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what happened? And you don't remember it? Do you think you're part of some, like, gay beat-up underworld? Like one of those gay beat-up clubs? Hey guys, does anybody know a nice restaurant? Like something where the napkins are cloth? Lori and I have been dating four years tomorrow, and I wanted to take her someplace nice. Yeah. Wow, you're... not very tolerant, huh. GUY Lori ever fart in front of you? Yes. Yes. Many times. No. GUY Oh. Why? Like what? Oh come on, nobody's expecting anybody to propose. Marriage isn't... I mean, isn't love enough? I submit that love is enough. So bad, but so good. Oh, I love this part.  HE'S FOR EVERY ONE OF US! TED  STAND FOR EVERY ONE OF US!  HE'LL SAVE WITH A MIGHTY HAND/EVERY MAN EVERY WOMAN EVERY CHILD WITH A MIGHTY FLASH! I can't, I'm taking Lori to dinner. Well, we've been dating four years tomorrow. Lemme ask you something... you don't think she's gonna be expecting something... big, do you? No, like... a circular gold thing on the finger. Stop it! Jesus Christ, knock it off! He throws Ted off of him. I mean, do you think she might be expecting me to make that kinda move? I guess I didn't think about that. This is the American fantasy, right here. A professional NFL player is called upon to save the world. Tom Brady could do that. The front door opens and LORI, an attractive girl in her mid to late 20's, enters holding several grocery bags. Hey, sweetie.  What do we got there? She's a comedienne. She's as pretty as she is funny. How was work? LORI Good. How's your dickhead boss? I'm not saying this to be mean, but I really hope that fucker gets leukemia.  Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis? Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski? It doesn't work, the name has to have a ""ski"" at the end of it. You just put ""brewski"" on the end of Martina Navratolova. They did? What happened? You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, I'd chew it off to get you free. I sure would.  Is that cannibalism? It's not true, I'm a fuckin' classy broad. You kiddin' me? Four years we been going out, I'm takin' you to the best place in town. I been crappin' out room for it for two days, I know exactly what I'm gonna order. And you get to pick any bottle of wine. Any bottle of 2012 wine. They are in and they. Are. Fresh. I love you. LORI I love you, too. Ah, come on! I am not. We hear another thunderclap. Ted runs into the room with no warning and leaps into bed, right between Lori and John. Actually, could you wrap just this up for me? I wanna scare the shit outta somebody. Yeah, but I read at a six year-old level. It's a special night. We've been dating for four years.  And hey, all those rich black people can't be wrong, right?  No, it doesn't. Oh my god, are you okay? Oh god, I'm so sorry!  CONTINUED: Oh Jesus, I'm so so sorry! I didn't see you! It was an accident! Did you hurt your head? Sorry. Does it hurt?  I'm... I'm John. LORI I'm Lori. Octopussy. But does that show that I care about you, or I care about Roger Moore? Thank you. And by the way, my dancing was not that bad. LORI  Your dancing was bad. I had some cool moves. That's not how I remember it. Hey, here's to four more years, huh? Now I know we said no gifts, but-- --But, I got you something anyway, in clear violation of the ""no gift"" rule. Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for a long time. Those are the ones you liked, right? From that kiosk at the mall? LORI Oh. Yeah. Check out the card. See, I even wrote the words with different colored markers so you wouldn't get bored while you were reading it.  Oh wow, a Hamilton! Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, I love it! She reacts a bit to this. Y'know, Lori...  Someday, there's gonna be a ring in there. But I wanna wait `til I can get you something really special, y'know? I just don't have the money right now. I know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. And what with the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti. LORI Look, I'm only saying this because I love you, but that's not realistic. You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted. Oh, Jesus, here we go-- Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner?  CONTINUED:  Lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. Look, he's been my best friend since I was eight. And I was not a popular child. You have to understand, I had no friends before he came along. He's the only reason I ever gained any fucking confidence. I coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know, I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out. I love you, too. You know that. Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `Cause I can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so I can see it backwards. I can do it all with one hand. I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller. Well, I hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship. I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin' jokes.  Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the seat somewhere. Can you call it?  Oh, yeah... No, it's from The Notebook.  This is gonna take some doin'. RAAARRRR!! Who lives here? I'm comin' to get whoever lives here! You owe me lobster money! Found my phone. What's goin' on?  Is that a shit? Yeah. Ted... you gotta move out. It's... it's gotta happen. Ted sits down on a bench, a little stunned and dazed. Ted, my relationship is at a very delicate stage, and, y'know, Lori and I may just need a little space right now. Plus a hooker took a shit in our apartment. Aaaa, what?! Don't tell me, I don't wanna hear about it! Did you get it? Tell me when you get it! AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I'm serious, learn to cook other- handed! I'll get the next one, okay? I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, Ted. I'll help you get on your feet out there, I promise. Fuck, all the time. We've got to get you a job. No, you don't. You look dapper. Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment. Well, you have no skills. As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school. Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after. Probably, yes.  Oh. Um, thank you.  I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale. I've had him since I was about your age. He's very special to me.  Ew, why the fuck did he say that? Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff. Oh man, I can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de-limbing you while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme. OH, MY LITTLE SIXPENCE/MY PRETTY LITTLE SIXPENCE/I LOVE MY SIXPENCE BETTER THAN MY LIFE. First night on your own. Okay... so... if you need anything...  CONTINUED: Seriously, anything...  I know you will, buddy. Hey. Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him.  Ooh, that's perfect, I'm only gonna need one. Most guys don't have you to motivate `em. No, you were right! Look, the reason I love you so much is the same reason I guess I take you for granted sometimes. It's `cause you're... inevitable. No, what I mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and I don't end up together. You're inevitable. Oh, I'm all right. Just... getting used to things, that's all. Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost our furry little guy. Hey, Ted. I could probably swing by after work. I can't just ditch work, man. Look, I'm trying to get my shit together and be an adult here, y'know? For Lori's sake. Really?  Sometimes adults get high. You'll kick me out in five. TED John, I have to kick you out. I am extraordinarily busy today, I have so much teddy bear paperwork to get through, it is retarded. Five minutes and you're outta here. What do I tell Thomas? I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried to break up a dog fight, and I guess she got hurt pretty bad. Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she sees trouble, she tries to help out, and I guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let go until the fireman showed up and had to stick his finger in his ass. Yeah, she's pretty shook up. Yeah, that's how they-- Yeah. Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one. You know, he's exactly who you want him to be. What is it? That doesn't sound very mellow. Y'know, this place looks great. How are the neighbors? That's lucky. You? No way, that's awesome. We should double date, you, me Lori and, what's her name? Uh, Mandy? Madison? Britney, Tiffany, Candice? TED Nope. Don't fuck with me on this. I know this shit. Okay, Brandi, Heather, Channing, Breanna, Amber, Sabrina, Melody, Dakota, Sierra, Bambi, Crystal, Samantha, Autumn, Ruby, Taylor, Tara, Tamra, Tami, Lauren, Charlene, Chantel, Courtney, Misty, Jenna, Krista, Mindy, Noelle, Shelby, Trina, Reba, Cassandra, Nikki, Kelsey, Shawna, Jolene, Earline, Claudine, Savannah, Kasey, Dolly, Kendra, Carla, Chloe, Devon, Emmylou, Becky? Okay, was it any one of those names with a Lynn after it? Okay. Brandi-Lynn, Heather-Lynn-- Fuck! Hey, well... it sounds like everything worked out then.  Lori's a senior VP at a big PR firm. We do, we talk about you all the time. Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we were talking about... how... neat all of Lori's shoes are? Oh my god yes. You canter.  Ooh! I hate that word. That word is so sharp. It's like an electric sword, slashing everything in its path. I... I'm trying to walk a line here, I want to be fair to you and to him, y'know?  Oh? Ohh...  I... I made you out to be a hero.  W... What? Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he? I did that for you-- for us! And it wasn't easy. Okay, look. I've been getting stoned too much. I know that. I've been bumming around with Ted too much, I know that, too. Give me one more chance, I promise I can fix it. Lori, I love you too much, please give me one more chance. I know. Done. Man, right here in front of you. Look at these pecs. Man pecs. Look at the hair on my upper lip. Man hair. I just farted. Man fart. You won't have to. Trust me. I love you. Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my hand. Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your boss' ass? That won't affect your workplace chemistry, will it? He's a bear. Wow, cool.  No. That's inspiring. You've led a rich life. Things are great, actually. You know... Lori would hate me for saying this, but... she's told me how you are at the office, and... as one gentleman to another, I just wanna say I really hope you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease. Well... that's good to hear. Okay.  CONTINUED: Hey, Ted. What?! Holy shit! How?  Just like in the movie.  CONTINUED: Fuck! I can't... I'm with Lori. I'm already on probation here.  I just... I can't.  I'm coming. This is one man to another. I don't really know you, but I'm trusting you. As a man. This is serious. Can I trust you?  Okay. Thank you.  I got ten minutes, where's Flash Gordon?  I... thank you for saving every one of us. With you? Yes. Oh my god, yes.  Not... recently, no. Holy shit.  All these people need to be talked to. Italian. What's the special on Tuesdays? Yeah--wait, whaddaya mean? Of course. Well yeah--why wouldn't they be? But why even bring that up-- Yeah, but why mention it? So why are we talking about it? Yes, let `em in. Right. Okay.  Hey Johnny, I just had a great idea-- let's go get drunk and puke on cars from the overpass!  Johnny, you gotta get over here man, I just tried this DMT all the kids are talkin' about, and I'm in trouble! I think I got sucked inside my chair! No, I don't sing in front of people! AAA! AAA!! Break his arm, Flash! Cut his arm off!! Sam, no! Get off him! Guy? What?? Yeah. Yeah, I don't feel good. Holy shit. Holy shit, oh my god! I gotta-- I gotta go! Shit! Lori... I... Lori! Lori wait! I'm sorry! I messed up! I-- Can I please just explain-- I was gonna-- I was gonna stop in for like five minutes, and then Flash Gordon-- Lori... please. I love you. Fuck you! I don't want to talk to you! Do you know what just happened? Do you have any clue? My life just ended.  Are you even listening to me?! Do you give any shred of a shit?! Jesus, Lori was right. I should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear. And because of that, I just lost the love of my life. I just... I gotta be on my own, Ted. I can't see you anymore. Who is it? Go away. JESUS-- Jesus Christ! What? You're un-fucking-believable, you know that? How stupid do you think I am? First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her-- Get outta here. Huh? Oh, and you can? Oh, yeah? Is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life? You can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship! It works out so much better for you when you and I are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't it?  You know... sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years old... and I wish I'd just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin. Teddy... Rux-fucking-pin. AAAAAA!!! Fucking Jesus fucking Christ! god fucking dammit!!! Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat, each one breathing heavily . John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back onto the bed. Ted taunts him. My dick is in the TV. So am I, man. I love you, too. Ted, we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it CPR. It died.  Hi. Hi, Norah Jones. Yes ma'am. Thank you for the opportunity, Ms.-- Ma'am Jones. Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins. Because I love her. This song always reminds me of the most important night of my life. The night we met. It's the theme song from the movie ""Octopussy."" ALL I WANTED WAS A SWEET DISTRACTION FOR AN HOUR OR TWO / HAD NO INTENTION TO DO THE THINGS WE'VE DONE / FUNNY HOW IT ALWAYS GOES WITH LOVE, WHEN YOU DON'T LOOK, YOU FIND / BUT THEN WE'RE TWO OF A KIND / WE MOVE AS ONE WE'RE AN ALL-TIME HIGH / WE'LL CHANGE ALL THAT'S GONE BEFORE / DOING SO MUCH MORE / THAN FALLING IN LOVE SO HOLD ON TIGHT / LET THE FLIGHT BEGIN...  CONTINUED: Lori! What-- what are you doing here? Good, good. I've, uh... made myself a nice little home at the Midtown Hotel up the street. I'd show you around, but it's kinda classy. They require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers. Uh, yeah. So, work's good? Everything good there? How's Rex? Oh. Good.  Well... I guess we can't make small talk all day, so I'll say what I wanna say. I could sit here and tell you I'm sorry, it was a huge misunderstanding, and I'm ready to change. But I don't think you wanna hear any of that crap. I'm not gonna try and get you to take me back. Why would you? I've been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years. I don't deserve you. I didn't take our relationship seriously, even though I love you more than life itself. All I want is... just to end on good terms. Because I owe that to you. I want you to be happy... and for us to be friends. Well. That's pretty much it. Hey. Oh, I'll be okay. If I get raped, it'll be my fault with what I'm wearing. Go ahead. Whoever this is, it's not a good time. Ted? Listen, I gotta call you back.  CONTINUED: What do you mean, what kinda trouble? What? Wait, slow down! Where are you?  Ted? Ted? Hello? Ted! I don't know. I don't know, but he's in trouble.  CONTINUED: No, it's blocked-- wait a second. Go! Take Columbus to Herald and get on the expressway! It's this creepy fucked-up guy who wants Ted for his creepy fucked-up son. They got him somehow. LORI Which way? Shoot up 99!  Hello, 911? I need the police right away! This guy took my teddy bear!  ...Hello?  Whoa whoa, stop stop stop! Come on, we're losing him! Get closer! Easy... EASY-- Yes! Fuckin' A right! Sorry, someone had to go Joan Crawford on that kid.  Come on! Oh Jesus...  Stay here. STAY THERE!! Ted! Lori, get the stuffing! Get it all! You're gonna be okay, buddy. you understand? You're gonna be fine. No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you're gonna be okay. What is it? Just try. Please. Just try. Ted! Oh my god! You're back! You asshole! It... it was you. You did it. (cover this line with addition:) It was your wish. Oh my god, do you know how awesome it was punching a kid? I felt so powerful! I mean if that's what it's like to hit a woman, watch out, I liked it. I love you, too.  And, I want you to know that... I'm probably never gonna be any more than a guy who rents cars, but... I don't care. You're the only thing that matters in my life. You and Ted. And after last night, I... I don't ever want to lose anyone who matters to me ever again. I'm not gonna wait any longer for my life to start. Lori... will you marry me?"
orphan,KATE ,Vera Farmiga," Wait, I've changed my mind. I don't want to do this anymore. The Doctor gives the Nurse an exasperated look. The Nurse takes Rate's hand, eases her back onto the table. No, this isn't what's supposed to happen. My baby's alive! But it's still alive! It's moving! Feel it, you can feel it! Kate tries to put the Nurse's hand on her.belly but the-Nurse- pulls away and hands the Doctor a pair of gleaming.blunt-tipped SURGICAL SCISSORS. The Doctor leans between Rate's spread legs, disappearing behind the curtain. Rate gasps. This isn't happening. Wake up, wake up, wake up... Suddenly -- the thin wail of a BABY CRYING. Rate's eyes go wide w ith horror as the smiling Nurse approaches with a wriggling bundle wrapped in a blanket. Blood seeps through the pink fabric. W e can't see what's inside, but it's moving. And it's CRYING. I was thinking of"" going back to work. I really thought 1 was doing better. I drove by the wine shop,on my.way.bome the other day. I really wanted to. The thought went through m' head, you know. it wasn't for me, it just might be nice to have a bottle handy in case we had guests. No. Wow, did you make this? -No, I'm sorry.. But just... take a break for a little while, okay? Max nods. Kate goes. back inside. A CAR pulls into the-drive.. It's John and eleven--year-old-DANIEL, Rate and John's other child. Daniel's blonde, brash, and-cocky, the all-American kid. He's wearing.a Little League uniform. Daniel runs toward Max. He steals her ball and dribbles-it around her in circles. -Max watches glumly. He offers her the ball, but when she reaches for it, he snatches it away and shoots a lay--up..- Curtains.  They're curtains, not drapes. And haw exciting is my life that -I now know the difference. Ore story. Then bedtime. Okay? Max nods. happily and picks up a book from her nightstand. Kate groans inwardly when she sees what it is. It'.s called. ""We were Going To Have A Baby, .But We Had An Angel Instead."" You want to hear about the baby again? Max nods. Kate hesitates, then gives Max a sad smile. ""People send us flowers and cards, but we still miss our baby. If this just happened to you, I'm sorry you got an angel instead of a'baby. I.think a baby would have been more fun."" The last picture is a FAMILY WITH A BABY ANGEL watching over them. Yes, she is. She's with us every day. Kate gives Max a gentle kiss on the forehead. I'm sorry. I can't. Shit... She moves away, tears suddenly in.her eyes. He gives a concerned look, lets her have her space. A beat. I'm so sick of feeling like this. Christ, the kids must thing I'm crazy. How can I? I saw a pregnant woman today on the way home and I almost lost it. Just burst into tears with Max sitting right there. Daniel barely talks to me. You and I haven't had sex in over a year now. What if I.never get better? I don't want to lose you. I can't even be a mother to the children we already have. But I should be. You Snow I do. More than anything. You-don't just adopt a child because you're lonely and depressed. We can't replace our baby. I used to teach music at Yale. I haven't worked for about a year. You're not worried about being prepared? Wow, that was nice of her. Look, we brought you something for the trip tomorrow. She hands her a bag of activity books and a ""Travel Turtle,"" a kid- sized lap desk for coloring in the car_ Yolanda's face lights up. Yeah. And happy. And excited. : And proud. And scared shitless. It' s funny. All the same feelings I had when I was pregnant with our others. It was nice meeting you. Thank you so much for all your help. Kate gives her a warm hug. But mid-embrace, she notices something: Esther is at the end of the hallway, peering at them from around a corner. Abigail and John see--her,' too. What did she say to me.back there? It sounded like... ""motta?"" She. made quite an impression on.you. She probably wasn't there when we were first ,looking. You sound like you're sorry we're not adopting her instead of Yolanda. So that's it? She just vanishes from our lives? I've been' in grief counseling for almost a year-and-a-half.. If you say the word ""closure,."" I'm going to-claw your eyes out. She's not angry, just matter-of-fact. Be wants to say something, but holds his tongue. Silence hangs heavy between them. Maybe we're not supposed.to do this. Her body's barely cold and you're already thinking about replacing her? We have to at least wait until.-- Let's see what Sister Abigail thinks. Why do'you think that is? By who? She really did open up with us, didn't she? A normal life..' That sounds really good,',doesn't it? - She smiles. and takes John- .'s hand. Put your thumb here. She makes the sign for 'T."" Esther. sees her mistake, corrects it. Sweetie, here we say ""Mont"" or. ""mommy."" Oh, we missed you so muchll Kate gives Max a kiss, then turns to Esther: Max hangs back, a little shy. Esther signs' to Max without speaking: - She's been practicing the whole way. Would you like to see-your room? Esther smiles and nods eagerly. But on the way up the stairs, she eyes Daniel furtively, sizing him up... I love you, too, sweetie. She kisses Esther on the forehead. John leans in for a kiss and Esther,hugs -him tight. Then he and Kate turn out the light and close the door. Esther watches them go...- Good luck II I love you II Remember, it's only a game. Okay, which one do you like? I'm sorry. I'll take them back and pick some just for you. '1s that a real place? These are cute. But sweetie, you have to have something you can play outside in. You should show her Hodgepodge when we get home. Max nods eagerly. Esther givee.them a curious look. Max. takes care of him all bir herself. It's her big girl responsibility. Sure. But you have to promise not to- let him out of his. cage .unless- Hcumey or Daddy is,here to hold him. Because he's very delicate and you could hurt him. Okay? Esther xiods. Kate scoops.flodgepodge up and kneels between the girls. Esther and Max share a  smile as they stroke his-fur. Too fast. Well, we'll get Esther settled, then I'll probably go back, to work. I'm not talking about Yale. I'm going to teach piano lessons from home. I didn't quit because I wanted to. I quit because.I couldn't work anymore. She's fine. Kate's pointedly not making eye contact with Doris now. Are you ready? Esther nods excitedly. John uncovers her eyes. Esther stops short in awe. It's the FISH TAN C from the shopping, mall. Esther kneels before it, entranced. She turns the black light on and off, marveling at- how it makes her dzess glow and the colors in her paintings light- -up. She gives Kate and John a. big smile. nave-you seen my pearls? Did you take this out of my jewelry box? Max shakes her head, confused. Then-how did it get in your room? Somebody put this around T.J.'s neck. Who was it if it wasn't.you? Max shrugs. She looks-nervous. Kate sighs. She can finish your game later.  Come on. Max pouts and follows Kate upstairs. Esther watches them go. I think we should try this with the door unlocked tonight. What do you say? Nobody's'going to come in. I'll stand right outside the door. Come in. The door opens. It's Esther and Max. I have a journal just like this that I write in every day. This is Daniel when he was born, And there's Max; And there's you. She turns next to a photo of the-whole- family taken at Esther' s welcome home party. The caption reads, ""ESTHER JOINS THE FAMILY."" The ones I saw in. your Bible. Esther gives her a dismayed look. It's okay, sweetie... I understand.  You know, I lost someone who was very .special to me once, too. Esther wipes her eyes and looks up, interest piqued. Oh, my God! They hurriedly pull the sheets up and Kate turns on the bedside lamp. Esther stares at them blankly. Yes. There are certain things that. grown-ups do. that kids aren't supposed to see. And that was one of them. Esther keeps painting. She still hasn't looked at her. - Esther, I need you to listen to me.. Esther pauses. She deliberately sets her paintbrush down and turns to Kate. An awkward beat. See, when two grown-ups love each other very, very much, they like to. show that love to each other -- Iknow.- They fuck. Kate is dumbfounded. Esther regards her with a bored, aloof-look. This wasn't something she overheard. She knew what it meant. And the way she said'it. I don't even think she expected to get in trouble over it. You think that's enough? Maybe. It just reminded The of what Sister Abigail said.. We really don't know that much about her.'- The last 'family she-was with could have been - like, ""Pass the fucking potatoes"" at the dinner table for all we know. ' If she's saying ""fuck"" to my face, what's she doing when we're not around? We have to be thinking about what kind of influence she's having-on Daniel and Max. Particularly Max.  Did you see what happened? Esther eyes Max expectantly. Max hesitates. Then: Put that away. Don't look at those. Kate puts the magazine back. There are several others just like it at kids-eye level. ""Orgasms UNLIMITED!"" ""Thrill EVERY INCH- Of Him J"" Kate'sighs and-'starts putting groceries on the conveyer.- Stand where I can see yowl At least eat your chicken. How was the.iide? Did you have fun? Max nods'and heads off; but Esther hangs back, eavesdropping: Didn't waste -arty time-turning that divorce settlement-into a tit job, did= she? Yeah, right. She's teasing, but there's something biting underneath it. Esther walks away, sipping on her juice box.. Oh,.my God... Have you seen a little girl in-a fish costume? She has short brown hair? Nobody's seen her. Kate grows frantic. Esther watches with a nonchalant smile, enjoying the drama.- She tugs on Kate's arm. Are you all right?- Don't you ever run off like that[ What were you thinking? Esther, come on. There's nothing to be afraid of. Esther, get out of the cart Righ t now! For a moment, they just glare at each other. Mexican stand-off.. Then Esther sticks her nose in the air and does as she's told. He's been our dentist for ten years. Why would he lie to us? I saw the bite marks. We're lucky he's not suing us. No, but she threw that fit at school So should .1 believe her when she says you've been hitting on Joyce Patterson? Did-she invite You over?' Oh, - come on. Then why didn't you tell me? Really? You sure it wasn't because you were coming-on to her so obviously that an eight-year-old picked upon it? A long-beat. John sighs, resigned.- You keep-saying that. But it's only been about two years since you told me.  Having another child was -supposed to bring us together. I was sick! You were just an asshole who wanted to fuck somebody else! Nice. Is that-what-your mother told you? Angry tears well in her eyes. He realizes be went too far.. Kate goes into the bathroom and SLAMS the door. What about the orphanage in Russia where she was raised? Wouldn't they have been able to tell? Do you think she had something to do with'what happened to Yolanda? A long beat. Sister Abigail hesitates, reluctant to answer. But what if 'the doctor says she's dangerous? A beat. He considers, uncertain and emotional. She's not dangerous? But that's not what's.been happening. I don't feel inadequate. What does that have to do with'Esther? Thanks for the support back there. Yes. Who's calling? Do you have any idea who could have done this? ' Esther, Daniel was there first. - Daniel eyes Esther. Wary, but defiant. She sighs and makes a -""cutting"" motion with two fingers. Daniel brusquely turns off th e game and gets out of the chair. - As' he leaves, Kate calls out, Daniel? Daniel? He ignores her and stomps upstairs. She watches him, concerned. This is what Sister Abigail was telling us about. Character-disturbed children, 'Look at the, symptoms. I still think Doctor Brow have missed something. iner couldd - I'm not 'seeing her anymore.. No, we don't. Why does everybody around here get the.benefit of the doubt fro m you except me? I don't need help. All I want is for a doctor who knows what they're doing to give us a second opinion.  What if somebody else thought there was something wrong with her? Like the director of the orphanage in Russia? Esther stops painting and listens, suddenly apprehensive. if it's a dead end, I'll drop it. - But if they say the same thine, then we'd have to get.a second opinion. John considers. He doesn't want to be unreasonable. He nods. Sister Judith? Hi, this is Kate .Coleman. I teas.wondering if you'd heard from anyone at the Sludianka Orphan's Shelter in Russia. sister Abigail said that...- Oh, you did? _  What do you mean?... Well, I don't understand. How could they not have any record of her being there? Daniel, wait a minute. He hangs back. Rate gives him and Max a concerned-.look. Does she ever make you guys feel uncomfortable or do things you know she's not supposed to? Has she ever hurt either of you? Daniel wants to say something, but the frightened look on Max's face stops him. Rate realizes she's struck.a nerve. Please. You can tell me anything. You do? Estherl Put that down --l Esther laughs and playfully pulls it away. Kate grabs her by the wrist and Esther suddenly drops the flower, SHRIEKING in pain. I just grabbed her arm! aohn hurries after Esther. Kate hangs back, picks the orchid-up"" from off the floor. it's ruined. She knew what it meant to me. She did it on purpose., I swear, I barely touched her. You know I would never hurt any of the-. kids on purpose. We're having guests over for dinner. The Cashier nods. Like be gives a shit. Kate lowers her eyes.- You dropped them on purpose. I set the brake. . Bven if I hadn'tr the police said it wouldn't have.:rolled unless it was put in neutral. I'll do whatever I have to,do to protect my children. The girls?"" You mean Esther found it. I didn't... I bought two bottles. I poured the other one down-the sink. I'm not going to rehab. I haven't had a drink in almost a year. John sighs, frustrated.- Dr. Browning intervenes, her voice infuriatingly even. and calm.' It's not a charade. I wanted to- drink i t. You have no fucking idea how.badly I wanted to drink it. But I didn't.  I know 1 should have told you..  I was just afraid of what you'd do. Max and Daniel are the only reason I'm still sober. I would never do anything that would hurt them. You know damn.well what I'm talking about. _ Her voice is brittle now, barely controlled. A beat. The tears sta rt to spill. When I look out at the pool and think...  When I try to imagine what would have happened if you hadn't come home early that day... it makes me want to kill myself. I would the before I let something like that happen again. I'm not the one you need to be worried aboutt Seven people close to Esther have died in the past year. Max was almost the eighth. now many more coincidences are you willing to ignore? I know I haven't given you any reason to believe me. But you have to. I'm begging you. What are you doing in here? Go to your room.  Who told you about that. - Esther holds up Kate's journal:: Kate blanches. I need to know where she came from and I need to know now. We adopted her from yquI How can you not know anything about her?!- Jesus Christ... She flips through the: Bible and shakes it, but there's nothing else. She notices that the Bible -is in a foreign language. There's an ink stamp on the inside cover. it's in the sa me. language as the Bible. ""See on saarne rnatituat omand."" She focuses on two words: seamne.Inatituut. Uh, hello.- I'm sorry, do you speak English? Do you speak.English? Does anybody there speak-English? This is very- important. Is this the Saarne Institute? I need to talk to someone about one of your children. She was adopted by.an American family about a year ago. A little girl, possibly adopted from your orphanage. I'm trying to find somebody who might remember her. Can't you at least check? Please, I know she at least spent some time there.' It's called the Saarne Institute. S-A - A-R-N-E. it's in Estonia: Please, just try to find out if sh e was ever a patient there. I'm sending them a-picture of her right now. Oh, my God! Daniell Baby, can you hear me? Please, baby! Wake up. He doesn't move. Kate calls out to Doris:. Call nine-one--onel Doris hurries back to the house. Kate catches Esther watching her warily.. Kate glares at her with pure hate. Get in here. I'm not letting her out of my sight.. Will he be able to tell us what happened? A pointed glance-between Kate and John. Dr. Rajan doesn't notice. How do we know? The orphanage we thought she came from has never even' heard of her[- Everything. about her could be a lie! It's just paper, JohnI From halfway around the world!-- This isn't last me being paranoid. Call. Saint Cabrini's yourself. if 'you don't believe me. A beat. John looks like he's wavering. Well, I'm done connecting the dots for you. You can believe what you want about me. Blame me for everything. I'll leave tonight if you want me to, on one condition. What-is it, sweetie? Suddenly, a CALL comes on the overhead speakers: Dan.iL-I! Kate and John try to enter the room, but the ICU NURSE stops them. What's happening --?1 Oh, no... Oh, no... Oh, my baby... _ What did you do?! Heads'turi. Doris and Max are taken aback. Kate looks insane. She strides.toward Esther, gaining momentum with every step, but Esther just looks up at her with a half-hidden smile on her fa ce. She killed him! He was going to live and she killed him!1 No! Get away from me l i! John... Please... Please don't let her take my family... A long, emotional beat. John hesitates, conflicted. Then he places her hand back on the bed and turns away. She tries to call out, but doesn't have the strength. - She sees the girls waiting in-the hallway. Max has been crying. She looks scared. John leads them all away. And the last thing Kate sees-before blacking-out again is Esther's devious smile... Hello? Who's calling? No, she's at home with my husband. He won't do it. He's not going to do anything without some kind of proof. This can't be. There has to be a mistake. But why was ahe at your hospital? And then she burned the house down... I need the police. There's an intruder in my home. _ John! Oh, my God! John!'1 She rushes to him, but it's obvious that he's dead. She leans over his body and bursts into tears, aching at what has been done to him... then stop and steels herself for what ]sh jds to do.. No!!"
syriana,BOB ,George Clooney," Liquid MDMA? No, I never tried it. Great. He's great. Arash just stares. Bob sips his drink. Are we gonna do this? A girl begins to dance in front of Arash. You said they were both for you. Arash tosses an envelope at Bob -- I was looking for the bathroom. MSA seems remarkably serene, then he screams in Arabic. You don't speak Farsi, do you, you son of a goat? MSA screams again, tightening his finger on the trigger, then he backs out the door, never losing aim on Bob. Those people back there don't know what's going on. They don't wanna know. And it's not like anybody else could roll in here. It's not like it's just reading reports. Well, then here we are. Let's say, somehow, I get a Branch or even a Group, then what? Will you come? Will you bring Robby? Now, Margaret looks away. A STUDENT-LEADER is up on a platform brandishing a Coke bottle, SHOUTING in Farsi into a bullhorn. He's against the ban on Coca-Cola. He says you have to fix your soul, which is not something you can put on a soft-drink. We see the faces of the protesters, silently staring, their mouths covered by black tape. And our analysis seems to be on the mark... And we're getting good satellite coverage. Bob is clearly working from a script. Terry George is pleased and gives Bob the slightest of approving nods. And we're reprogramming resources into Iran. Our next review will show that --- It's possible. It's complicated. They let young people march in the street and then the next day shut down fifty newspapers. They have a few satellite dishes up on roofs, let 'em have My Two Dads, but that doesn't mean the Ayatollahs have relinquished one iota of control over that nation. The steno guys hands are frozen. We've had Iran in embargo for almost thirty years, we backed their neighbor, a neighbor we invaded twice, in a ten year war against them, we're hanging on by a thread with a massive occupation force, so I got news for you... Thomas Jefferson just ain't that popular over there right now. Silence except for the steno guys clicking away, then complete silence. Terry George stares at Bob a long beat. How's your mom? she's a secretary. She was a secretary. Robby, you know, I live... Where do I live? Maryland. I live in Maryland. Meaning you have residency there. In Maryland. For the University. Of Maryland. Robby liberally uses the hot sauce. Two LEBANESE MEN at another table nod in approval. Robby fires off Arabic. Robby, it's complicated. I may have really screwed up at work. I was supposed to keep my mouth shut and didn't. Robby is disappointed and angry. She's a secretary. Robby turns back to the Arab men -- Intelligence work isn't training seminars and little gold stars for attendance. It's two people in a room and one of them is asking a favor that's a capital crime in every country on earth. A hanging crime. Another corner. Another white hallway. Prince Nasir Al-Subaai. It's a great city. Everybody chuckles. Did you see my report on the missile? I reset guidance to blow ten feet off the ground -- We're not getting divorced. Stan looks at him like he's kidding himself. What about this C.L.Z. - Committee to Liberate Iran? My goal was always to own a bar in Macau, before Macau got ruined like everywhere else. I'm not doing anything sitting in that office. That's the problem.  Bourbon rocks -- Bob glances up at the TV. ON TV: financial news, BRYAN WOODMAN in front of the trading floor at his company. Stan, I got a chance to go back. I want to go back. Is it safe for me? How can you tell if you're talking to a Shiite or a Sunni Muslim. I'm here to see Said Hashimi. They roughly frisk Bob. Hashimi. Said Hashimi. They take his pen, remove his belt, check his passport: it's Canadian. Bob's picture. The name is SEYMOUR RISEN. They check his license: the name is SEYMOUR RISEN. Thank you for this audience. I have a business proposal for Mussawi. One that benefits everyone. Hashimi nods magisterially. I thought it would also be prudent to say, I have no interest in Hezbollah. This is business and it doesn't concern Hezbollah. In the distance a dog barks and chickens cluck. After a beat, Hashimi turns his rheumy eyes on Bob. Yeah, sure. Only one of them was propelled by gas and the other by He saw an engine coming at him at 27,000 feet per second and his heart stopped. This settles a beat. I'm between State Department and Defense. Bob surreptitiously looks around to see if Mussawi is alone. It's clear Bob makes him nervous as well. I'm getting some information, Jimmy. Okay, Jimmy. Mussawi glances down at the picture. It surprises him. ANGLE on the picture of PRINCE NASIR crossing a street. Bob has a small pad on which he scribbles a dollar figure. Mussawi glances at the number. He's impressed. I want you to drug him, put him in the front of a car and run a truck into it at fifty miles an hour. Canadian. Nasir motions for them to squeeze together for Bob. The gate closes. The lift creaks and begins to rise. Yes. Yes. Bob is framed by two, not-bright CIA SECURITY OFFICERS. Yes. Of course I was aware. It's why I went after them. what do you think? I'm okay. I'm fine. Hey -- I saw these Shiites selling an Egyptian a missile. In Iran. I had a feeling about this guy, a Sunni nut-job, but I'm back here where I got on the wrong side of Terry, then an opportunity just happened to come up involving someone I worked with before, not a radical, I mean, he went to Rutgers, only now he flips, wants to cut my goddamn head off. And now they got me isolated away in here and they send these suits around asking me nonsense questions about bad people who are no longer with us, no longer with us on their goddamn orders. So you tell me what happened. You tell me, Margaret. Margaret doesn't know what to say so she says nothing. What about Fred? Fred. Fred turns and sees Bob, looks around uncomfortably. What's going on, Fred? I was almost killed, Fred. My hands were mutilated. And they're asking me about the Amiri brothers? About Tehran? I typed in Prince Nasir Al-Subai and my computer gets seized. Where did this Prince Nasir job come from? Why was I tortured. Why am I being investigated? Why was I sent? NEIGHBORS stare. Fred's kids look out the window. Stan, why did Mussawi double-cross me? Why does no one care that a Sunni radical named Mohammed Sheik Agiza has our missile? And why did they open a damage assessment on the Amiris? And on me. For doing my job? What about Mussawi? Did Prince Nasir hide Mohammed Sheik Agiza in the Water Ministry? Does he fund terrorist organizations? Who's worried about the Nasir job? Stan, who's worried about me talking? On the screen: a LOUD, ACTION BEAT. Stan leans over and You were in Beirut in '84. I didn't used to need to know. A Grand Slam Breakfast is set in front of Bob. Bacon looks perfect, Deborah. Bob puts syrup on the pancakes. Eats a piece of bacon. Innocent until investigated. That's nice. It has a nice ring to it. I bet you've worn some miles on little sayings like that. Very wise, gives the listener the sense of law being written as it's spoken. If anything happens to me or my family, an accident, an accusation, anything, then first your son will disappear, his body will never be found. Then your wife. Her body will never be found either. This is guaranteed. Then, whatever is the most dangerous thing you do in your life, it might be flying in a small plane, it might be walking to the bank, you will be killed. I've made decisions that resulted in deaths, but I never lost a nights sleep. Never. I killed people, but I always had about 500 pages of U.S. law behind me, law that I believed in, and that was good enough. I want my passports back. If I told you I knew of something that was going to happen to someone and that I felt I had to try and stop it even though it will probably cost me my job, what would you say? She really looks at him. It's okay. It's okay. Bob slowly. approaches Prince Nasir's vehicle. They stare at one another. Nasir lowers his window."
mirrors,BEN ,Kiefer Sutherland," Almost 8:30... Coffee? Go back to sleep... I'll call you, OK? See you later, Angie. I just got here. Thanks Larry. No, not yet. No, I'm staying at my sister's, in Queens. She's a bartender. You know what I want. I'm ready to come back, I'm feeling much better now. Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready. What?! Come on Larry, a security guard job... I'm not ready to retire yet! I do. The one that burned down? Yeah, in a couple months... I gave everything for the NYPD. I almost died out there. Everyone seems to have forgotten that.  Amy, it's me... I just wanted to let you know that I got a job today... It's nothing special, just a security guard job... If you still want to go ahead with it, we can sign the divorce papers... I mean, if that's what you really want.  I've been thinking about Michael's birthday tomorrow. It would be nice if we could celebrate it together ... You know, for the kids' sake... Call me... Please. Did you clean them? The mirrors, why are they so clean? Why did he leave? Almost a year. I was wounded during a holdup... It kind of changed my perspective on things. How old are you, Lorenzo? I do now. I think your grandpa just wants to scare you a little. See you tomorrow. Fuck... Well I don't know, I just found this package hidden behind a tree. Maybe...  Daisy, has Michael been a good boy? Does he deserve his birthday present? Is mom back? Hello Rosa! I'm good, very good... What time will Amy be back? OK, I'll wait for her. No, thank you. I'll be fine. Happy birthday, Michael. Hey Amy...  Ok kids, it's time for your bath. No fooling around. I do, but you never take my calls! I haven't had a drink in three months but, then again, how would you know? You don't think people can change? Just give me another chance. WHAT RULES?! IT'S MY SON'S FUCKING BIRTHDAY TODAY! COME ON AMY, WHAT RULE IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM?  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you... Things could be so different between us. Yeah... Anyway, I wasn't planning on staying. My shift starts in an hour. I'll just kiss them goodbye and then I'm leaving. I haven't managed to find the source of the leak. My guess is it doesn't come from the store... It must be a municipal pipe that blew with the cold... Nothing special... You can't avoid them. They're everywhere... The mirrors... In the department store, at every street corner, in the windows of every fucking building in this city. I feel like I'm not the one looking into the mirrors, but rather they're looking at me. No, I'm serious. Gary? Gary? Coming... What happened? Did they mention the cause of death? Have a good night, Lorenzo.  Damn... What is happening to me? Amy, I need you to do me a favor... I need your help... It won't take more than twenty minutes. Please, Amy? You picked up this guy yesterday morning... I need to take a look at him. It's very important. He used to work at the Mayflower as a night watchman, before I replaced him. I found his wallet in the department store. I need to find out how he died... He sent me a package before he died, with newspaper articles about the Mayflower... I think he was trying to tell me something... I don't know him. I've never even met him, Amy... I need to figure this out. You know a lot of people who cut their own throats? How... What did he slit his throat with?  I need to see his files... I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES! I won't leave until I see that file. Look at this picture... Come and see, Amy. Look... Look at the piece of mirror in his hand. In the reflection of the mirror it's covered in blood, and look- in reality, it's clean. Not a drop of blood... Don't you find it strange that this mirror doesn't reflect an exact image of reality? What if the mirrors were showing us something different? What if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality? Thanks for your help... Please, not you... I made a deal, Angie... I can't just walk out on them like that. I need this job, I need the money. I'm not going to sleep on your couch for the rest of my life! LEAVE ME ALONE... Mrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My name is Ben Carson. I worked with Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up and talk to you for a few minutes? Mrs. Lewis ? Did he use any drugs? Did you notice anything different, the days prior to his leaving the house, anything unusual in his behavior? What kind of changes? Sleeping? Busy doing what? Is that you standing next to him? Mrs. Lewis, I found a note that Gary wrote. May I see his room? Do you mind if I stay in here for a moment?  WHERE ARE YOU?!! STAY CALM... I'M COMING! I'm here Ma'am... Ma'am? I'm right he... Sorry I'm calling you this late. Were you sleeping? Don't worry, everything's OK. Actually, no. I think maybe I'm losing my mind. You were right about the Mayflower... I'll quit tomorrow. No, I'll wait till the daytime guy gets here to tell him. Yeah, sure. See you later, Angie. Love you too, sis. No, I don't want to put them in any danger. I've got things I need to deal with. She asked me to quit and they got to her... I know who did this Amy. They wouldn't believe me and neither would you... Goodbye. Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE TO KILL HER? What is it you want? What do you want from me? ANSWER ME! WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?! ...Look up Esseker... Yes, Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo... Esseker. No idea, my guess is that it's a name... No, I haven't got a first name. Yes, in New York. Over the past five or six years. I know it's hazy but that's all I've got. I already looked it up in the phone book. I also called someone at the IRS and at the DMV, but nothing there. It's very important Larry. You'll call me back? Ok... Yes, so, what'd you find out? Nothing under that name? Shit, shit, shit, shit... Can you look up Berry, Terrence Berry... ...Got anything? Great...No, I already know all that. Is he still alive? No... Can you find out where he was committed before his death? Wait, I'm writing it down... ...Roosevelt Psychiatric Detention Center... Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks. Did you consider Terrence innocent? Amy...  I have to go. Don't worry, there's nothing wrong. Everything is OK... I'm doing it to protect you. Look Amy, you've got to trust me, I know what I'm doing... It's for your own good. You have to trust me Amy, I'm not completely crazy... These mirrors are dangerous. At first, I thought it was only the ones at the store, but now I know they can get you anywhere. They got Angela... I promise I'll leave the house once I've taken them all down. Come Amy, come with me, I want to show you something. Look, you'll see... Wait, look, you'll see... But... I swear to you I... I saw...Amy... Hello, Larry? It's me... I'm going to need your help again- Mayflower used to be a hospital before it became a department store. St. John's Hospital. Do you have any idea where all the medical records could have ended up after it closed down? Go to the city hall archives... They must have something considering it was a public hospital. Larry, Larry stop it... If I could go myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go to the City Hall archives, and ask them to look up Esseker among the former patients. Please. Please, do it for me. Talk to you later. What have I done? I don't understand... What have I done? Perfect, Larry. That's perfect. I don't know exactly. I can't tell you, but some really fucked up things started happening to me when I took the job over there. Nothing makes any sense to me either but I have to follow my instinct. Anna Esseker... Where did you find her files? Did you go to City Hall? What? What about the doctor? Dr. Kane? You're still alive, aren't you? You're wrong Larry, you're wrong... ...she left the hospital on the 4th. Amy ? What's wrong? What? What's happening? Where are Daisy and Michael? Are the kids all right? Get out of the house. I'll be right over... I'm right here, Amy. I'm here now... Thank god you're alright. Anyplace is gonna have mirrors or windows... Anything you can see your self in is dangerous. We have to make the house safe. The only way is to cover all the reflections. If we keep them in the dark we can avoid them. We need paint, we need tape... As quickly as I can, sweetheart. I promise. They want her, I'm gonna find her wherever she is. We don't have any other choice. I'm sorry about everything I've put you through... I didn't want to... Amy, I want you to stay here with the kids until all this is over. All the mirrors are covered, there's no more danger. I'll come back as soon as I can. Hey baby, everything's gonna be fine. I love you. Hello... Is this the Esseker farmhouse? I am looking for Anna, Anna Esseker. I huh... I am doing some research for a book on the history of St. John's Hospital, in New York... And after the hospital? Anna left the hospital two days before the massacre. Kane changed the records to make her disappear. I want to know. After St. John's, where did she go? For a while? And after? Why did she leave? With Anna? With the mirrors? Mr. Esseker, tell me where I can find your sister. It's very important. It's a matter of life and death. Where is she now? Hello Sister. I have come to visit a member of your community... Sister Anna? Her real name is Anna Esseker. No, not really. Listen, Sister, I must see her. Please, tell her that I came all the way from New York and that I work with Dr. Kane at St. John's Hospital... My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as a night watchman at 1229 West 38th Street in New York City, what used to be St. John's Hospital. I need your help. My wife and children are in danger. What is threatening my family is asking for you... If you don't help me I may lose the only thing that matters to me. Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you? I must know, Sister. A window... For what? For whom? What truth? It entered with you and they need you to get out. Wait... Please, listen to me- Terence Berry, Gary Lewis and many others before me... Those are the people who died trying to find you. Because they failed, their families died too. My sister was murdered two days ago... My wife and kids will next if you don't come with me. Look- My wife and two children. They're all I've got. They're innocent... Please. I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK THERE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE. WHILE YOU'RE PRAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING ON YOUR TIME! What? Amy, what's going on? Are you alright? No Amy, stay with me... Where is Michael? Amy? Amy? Answer me? My kids are not going to die tonight. You're coming with me, now. You have my word. Answer! God damn it... Answer the phone... Fuck... Something's wrong over there, my wife is not answering. We have to get inside the Mayflower now. Come on, let's go. Watch your step, a water pipe has burst, the whole basement is flooded."

Then my mama get the check 'n food stamps for me 'n Little Mongo. But it's my baby. Little Mongo is money for me, not her! ...Sometimes I see vampires too. They come for me sometimes and they say that I am one of them. They say, ""Precious, you belong wif us."" I say, ""Check wif my muver."" After that, they just look at me and go down through the floor. The family downstairs is vampires so that's where they should go. I'm going to the doctor now too. It's nice. Miz Rain, she fall out when she finded out that I ain' been to no doctor. Whole class scream 'preenatal' at me.

I want filfy rich white folks welfare. Mama crazy but Mama not stupid. I am happy to be writing. I am happy to be in school. I am happy to know my baby coming soon. Don't see the sense in pretending I am not pregnant anymore. I am also thinking about lil Mongo a lot. Miz Rain say we gonna write everyday, that mean home too. And she gonna write back everyday. Thas great. Mama say this new school ain' shit tho. Say you can't learn nuffin' writing in no book. Gotta git on that computer you want to make some money. But Mama wrong about that.

Dear Miz Rain, All the years I sit in class I never learn, but now I got baby again by my fahver. I wish I had a boyfriend like other girls and then I'd feel right that I have to quit school. I love my baby but want school too. Dear Miz Rain... Social worker ask me if I want to give Little Mongo and Abdul up for adoption. I could kill her. She never help before. Now she want to take my kids away? If she take Abdul, I won't have nothing nomore. Dear Miz Rain, Grandmuver come visit and say only a dog will drop a baby and walk off. Say later not even a dog. Dear Miz Rain, Lot of questions you ask. No muver, no grandmuver and father rape me years. Little Mongo wif my grandmuver. Best for me to stop breaving sometimes I think. I want to be a good mother too tho. Dear Miz Rain, I is best able to meet my child's need. The welfare help Mama, it help me. MAMA! ! ! MAMA! ! ! STOP IT MAMA! YOU GON CRAZY?!!! I AIN'T STEAL NUFFIN FROM YOU MAMA! YOUR HUSBAND RAPE ME AND I NOT STUPID! SHUT UP MOMMA! I NOT STUPID! I AM NOT STUPID! DON'T SAY THAT! I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DIDN'T ALREADY. YOU CRAZY BITCH! I need to see Nurse John. Where Nurse John at? You don't know me bitch. Get lost 'fore I kick your ass. Bitch? I ain't make no mistake unless it was being born. My Mama kick my ass again. I ain' giving Abdul away. And I ain' gonna stop school ...I just...ain't. Nurse John say lots of people get out of hospital wif no place to go. His eyes look worried tho ...Wonder what next? Scared now.  AB    C D E F G H I J K L M N 0 P, Q RS    T U V, W X Y Z.  Now   I know my ABC's, tell me what you   think of me. Miz Rain say I was moving through the vowel 'n consonant sounds faster than even Rhonda Johnson was. Maybe could've even catched up to Jermaine. Maybe ... Where my baby?! Where my baby at?! I can tell by Miz Rain's face that I ain' gonna be homeless no more. Only I ain' so sure where I'm gon end up tho. Thas the one time I heard Miz Rain curse. They have ...something. It's an immediate opening and it's in Queens. Queens?  I don't really know Queens. Hi Miss Lisa. Good. How you been? Thanks. Huh? ...Oh... This Abdul. Thanks.  Y'all really married? I don't know. Stuff in my life. Abdul. Mama say homos is bad peoples ... ...But homos not who rape me, homos not who let me sit up in school 16 years and learn nuffin and homos not sell crack to peoples in Harlem. I wonder what Oprah have to say about that? Y' all watch Oprah? After I settle in halfway house, I work my hardest to memorize letter sounds, write in journal and read smaller and fatter books. Then I find out Mayor's office give me Literacy Award and check for progress. Everybody at the party, Nurse John, Cornrows and the staff stop in too, but they need to get back to they desks before too long. Whole operation can't stop just cause Miss Precious get a trophy. Even Ms. Katherine shows. I owe the chicken place for a bucket that I swiped last year. Thas first. After that, get some thangs for Abdul. Miz Rain? Like dis. ...No. The good word...wif Ms. Rain? You ain't her type. Miss Lisa this Nurse John. Nurse John this Miss Lisa. Y'all work it out. Not yet. I forgot to say thank you for my party. I ...No... Well, I was thinking... You talk to us girls in the class when we be working out problems and thangs and stuff, right? Well, who do you talk to?  Or you probably don't have no problems so... Oh, okay...I didn't have nobody to really speak wif for a long time. I know how that be sometimes so thas why I asked cause almost evrybody need a little help once in a ...  Well ...only that -well, evrybody need a little help once in a ...  I jus ...  I just thought that if you might need some ...  ...Yes.  Me? I never... Nuffin? ...For real? I jus help you finish up first. I got some time. Some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples. I think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel before. And in that tunnel, maybe the only light they had was one that was inside of them and then -even long after they escaped that tunnel, they still be shining for everybody else. Thas Miz Rain to me. In a book I read, a lady escaped to a 1/2 way house. And the lady, she asked the people there just what a 1/2 way house was. They tole her, you is 1/2 way between the life you had and the life you want to have ...Thas nice. That also mean I can't stay here forever and that there is still a ways to go. It be something to get apartment of my own. Abdul nine months old and walking! Smart too. I been reading to him since the day he was born almost. Barely talkin' and he countin' . Mama, Daddy, I.S. III and 444 Lenox Avenue already seem like a past life or some old bad dream. I wish I could have started out from here but still wif Abdul and poor Mongo. Come in... Thas Rhonda. She always early. ...Is that all? ... You got it? The AIDS virus. How you know? No, I don't know Mama. He never been wif you? You better go to the doctor Ma. I'm home here.  I better go see 'bout Abdul and do homework. Nurse say I am H.I.V. positive. I don't have nuffin to write today and I don't hate no one. Not even my muhver. My head is all dark inside so I don't have nuffin to write today...Maybe nuffin never. Yeah. He good...Won't bress feed him no more to be safe. What for? How?! I feel like I am drowning inside a giant river Miz Rain. Thas what... FUCK YOU! YOU DON'T KNOW NUFFIN WHAT I BEEN THROUGH!!! I NEVER HAD NO BOYFRIEND! MY DADDY SAY HE GONNA MARRY ME BUT HOW HE DO THAT, FUCKING ME ILLEGAL? I NEVER BEEN NO CHILD! NOT EVEN ONE DAY!!!  I'm tired Miz Rain! Nobody love me. Thas a lie. Please don't lie Miz Rain! Love?! Me?! Love rape me, beat me, call me animal, get me sick and make me feel wurfless. I had enough love.  No. Some things is hard to say and maybe not your business no way but Rhonda's brother rape her for years and when her muhver fine out, she throw Rhonda out her house. Jermaine say mens beat her and then rape her for what she is. Muhver throw her out the house when she fine out that she different from other girls. Miz Rain still a sort of mystery, but a nice one like the sun. Miz Rain right too. These girls is my family now. They visit me at hospital when I had Abdul and even take up a collection when Mama kick me out. They got love in they eyes and in they hearts for me, same as I got for them. I do. Nothing. I don't know. It's sort of hot in here I guess. A soda sounds nice ...please. I don't care. Orange. Thank you. Really? 'I have just finished a session with Claireece Precious Jones, an eighteen-year-old African American female. According to her teachers at Each One Teach One where she attends school she is a pen-, phen- ...success. Having made strides so tre-men-tremendous in the past year, she was given the mayor's award for outstanding achievement. She seems actively en...engaged in all aspects of the learning process. However, her TABE test scores are disappointingly low... ' Not to Miz Rain! Not to Miz Rain!  'She scored 2.8 On her last test.' So what! Miz Rain- 'She will need at least an 8.0 Before she can enter G.E.D. Class and begin work toward her high school e-q...equivalency.' Thanks.  'Abdul is the client's second-born child. He's from all outwhere... 'Appearances, a healthy and welladjusted toddler. Precious attends to his needs a-s-s-i-d-u-o-s-l-y... ... 'and with great affection and ee... ' ... 'seeks any and all information on child rearing. The time and resources it would require for this young woman to get a G.E.D. or into college would be considerable'... I don't want to be no motherfucking home attendant! I wanna be... She say she not put that in my file! Bitch!  That file do show one thing -that I'm getting my G.E.D., a job, and a place for me and Abdul, then I go to college. I don't want to 'home attend' nobody! Miz Weiss just part of the gang but definitely not cool. And social worker look at me like I am ugly freak who did something to make my own life like it is. I guess I am trying to figure out just what has happened to me while Miz Weiss just hell bent on making me go wipe old people's asses. Got to sort dis out quick tho 'fore Abdul's next birthday -coming up fast. I don't really want to read all I wrote, I jus' wanna kinda say what it is I'm writing about and how it came about. Well, to make a long story short, the counselor at Advancement House quizzing me about Mama and Daddy etc., etc. But it's really about workfare. She want to send me out as home attendant. Cause I stole my file from Advancement House and read it. All this 'What you wanna be?' And 'You can talk to me.' They ain' no motherfucking therapists on our side, they just flunkies for the 'fare. I wanna work, but not for no motherfucking welfare check in Central Park -displacing brothers and sisters who really got jobs cleaning up 'cause I'm there working for free. Miz Rain, If I didn't steal that file I wouldn't know what I was facing! Yeah...basically. The people had her there all day and night - 'on call' they call it. But you only get pay for 8 hours so that's 8 X $6.37 (referring to her notebook) = $50.96 a day, but then you is not really getting that much cause you is working more than eight hours a day. You is working 24 hours a day and 50.96 divided by 24 is... Home attendants usually work six days a week. I would only see Abdul on Sundays? When would I go to school?  Am I gonna hafta go be home attendant like Rhonda was?  Well, I just write in my notebook till I get wif some kinda therapist I can trust. Actually that always help me more than talking to her. Plus, I'm going to start going to meetings wif Rita for insect survivors. That's what I mean. What's the big deal? No. I never really had nothing tested...nothing like that. Glasses is what I really want so my eyes don't hurt when I be reading at night. Rita and me on our way. I look at subway map sometimes and wonder where I be if I go to the end of the line. Jermaine say there be a white boy wif a baseball bat when you get off. Rita say it's not true, or if it be true, it's only part true. I was raped by my father and beat by my mother ever since I could remember anything at all. Raped and beat by both. Anyway, thas all I'd like to say for today. Thank y'all for letting me share... Everything is floating around me now. Like geeses from the lake. I see flying. Feel flying. Am flying. Far up...Thank you Rita for getting me here on time. ...How you get your hair like that? Thank you Miriam. Rita ask me do I want another hot chocolate. I do but I don't want to be greedy, even if her boyfriend do give her money. I'm alive inside. A bird is my heart. Mama and Daddy didn't win. I'm winning. I'm drinking hot chocolate on the Upper West Side with girls - all kind who love me. How does a stranger meet me and love me? One day Miz Rain ask us to write about our ideal self...I wrote that I would be light skinned and small wif wavy swing-job hair.  Miz Rain read all that and then say I am beautiful like I am. I never believe her before but somehow, today, this moment -can't say why, I do. Just now...The inside I thought was so beautiful is a black girl too. I was born in November...far as I know. That's enough Mama. That's ... enough.  You know, I didn't realize what you was until this day -even after all those thangs you did. Maybe I didn't know no better or maybe I just didn't want to but I finally see you crystal clear for the first time.  I forgive you too. ...but I'll never see you again. Not even if you dead.  Stay down Mama. I forgive you too. I can tell right now that you ain't qualified for dis kind of mess. I took the TABE test again. This time it's 7.8. Last time it was 2.8."
newsies,JACK ,Christian Bale," Wake up, Crutchy -- The World is waitin'. Who says you're fakin' it? Ain't decided yet. Jack spots a passing wagon and helps Crutchy on board -- he and Mush jump on for the ride and they all move off -- Better choke it, Blink -- 'fore you need another patch. KID BLINK Hey, who ya sellin' wit, Jack? CRUTCHY Not wit you! JACK Nothing personal, Blink, but... IT TAKES A SMILE AS SWEET AS BUTTER CRUTCHY THE KIND THAT LADIES CAN'T As Jack sings, the boys             RESIST listen carefully. They all respect his opinion.                       RACETRACK IT TAKES AN ORPHAN WITH A STUTTER WHO AIN'T AFRAID TO USE HIS... KID BLINK ... FIST  Runnin'. Ya miss me, Weasel? Don't rush me -- I'm perusin'                          * the mercandice... Mr. Weasel.                          * The Newsies love it as Jack deliberately takes a paper, turns and scans.  Seeing Les staring at him, Jack winks. Les smiles back, fascinated. Jack turns back to Weasel with a fifty-cent piece. JACK The usual. Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his            * grasp and onto the counter. The Newsies whoop. WEASEL Hundred for the wiseguy -- next!                       * scans the newspaper for a catchy headline; Race, Crutchy, the others wander up, doing the same. A commotion O.S. and they look up to see -- -- at the window, Weasel is in David's face.                     * That and a lotta other things -- including Jack Kelly, which is what my mudder called me. What do they call you, kid?  No kiddin'. How old are you, Les? LES Near ten. JACK No good. Anybody asks, you're seven.  Younger sells more papes, Les -- and if we're gonna be partners -- DAVID Hold it! Who said anything about partners -- ? JACK You owe me two bits, right? Okay, so I consider it an investment. We sell together, split 70-30, plus you get the benefit of observin' me -- no charge. CRUTCHY  You're gettin' the chance of a lifetime here -- you learn from Jack, you learn from the best. DAVID If he's the best, then why does he need us? Sixty-forty.   Or I forget the whole t'ing. David reluctantly offers his hand. Jack spits in his palm and shakes. Les whoops and they move off, Jack already being the mentor -- JACK The name of the game is volume, Dave. You only took twenty papes -- why? Some newsies got corners, see -- same spot, same customers. Me,                         * I like to keep moving, enjoy the life of the big city. I spot an opportunity, I sell a pape. That's the advantage of being an independent businessman, instead                       * of workin' for wages.                                  * You're a natural, kid. You remind me of me -- and I can't say greater than that. 'Terrified flight from flaming inferno!' Thank you, much obliged -- Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got an education. Hey, no drinkin' on the job -- it's bad for business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin'? Beat it -- the bulls! He races off. David, confused, races after him, Les looks very worried as he runs with David -- No?   What're they doin' then? DAVID I think they're chasing you! Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David, still uncertain, looks back at them -- the runs across the plank. Jack calmly topples the plank to the street as the pursuers reach it, gasping for breath -- he gives Snyder a little salute, then moves on to a rooftop exit -- I was starvin'. I stole some food. DAVID  Right, food. He called you 'Sullivan' -- JACK  Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm lyin'? DAVID You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you? Because I escaped. LES  Oh, boy. How? JACK This big shot gimme a ride out in his carriage. DAVID  Bet it was the mayor, right? JACK Nah. Teddy Roosevelt.    Ever heard of him? David starts to reply when he sees something behind Jack             * that makes his mouth drop open. At the top of a short                * flight of stairs, a vision is frowning down at them,                 * speaking in a theatrical Swedish accent.                             * You wouldn't kick me out without a kiss goodbye, wouldya, Medda? Surprised, she gasps in delight -- throwing her arms around Jack. David can't believe it. Medda's accent quickly disappears. MEDDA Kelly, where've you been, kid? I miss you up in the balcony -- you know I sing all my songs to you. This is David and Les. And this is the greatest star of the vaudeville stage today, Miss Medda Larkson, the Swedish Meadowlark. MEDDA  Welcome! JACK Medda also owns the joint. Okay if we hang here awhile, Medda? 'Til a little problem outside goes away? That's Sante Fe -- out in New Mexico? Soon's Pop finds us the right ranch, they're sendin' for me. LES  Then you'll be a real cowboy... What I saw today, I gotta say your boys are born Newsies, Mr. Jacobs. With my experience and their hard work -- just a little more, thanks --  -- I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and not break a sweat.  'Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I'm talkin' too much... How'd your pop get hurt? DAVID The factory. An accident.  He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him. He's got no union to protect him.  Carryin' the banner. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL A FAMILY MOTHER, DAUGHTER; FATHER, SON GUESS THAT EVERYTHING YOU HEARD ABOUT IS TRUE AND I'M FREE LIKE THE WIND Still singing,               LIKE I'M GONNA LIVE FOREVER Jack drops off the fire      IT'S A FEELING TIME escape into the alley;       CAN NEVER TAKE AWAY moves to the sidewalk        ALL I NEED'S A FEW MORE DOLLARS and walks off.               AND I'M OUTTA HERE TO STAY DREAMS COME TRUE YES, THEY DO IN SANTA FE Awright, pipe down! Don't you see it's a gag? Just Weasel bein' a weasel. Joke's over, Wease. Gimme a hunnerd. He plops fifty cents on the counter.      Weasel's grin gets weaselier as he slides it back. One thing for sure. If we don't sell papes, then nobody sells papes. Nobody comes through those gates 'til they put the price back where it was. Yeah, a strike -- good idea, Dave. We go on strike, we're a union, right? Keep it comin', Dave -- Dave's right again! We gotta think this through! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers, they run this city. Do we really think a buncha streetrats like us would have a chance against people like them? We talk to 'em. RACETRACK Some of 'em don't hear so good. JACK Then we soak 'em. We gotta get word out to all the                            * Newsies in New York! I gotta have                           * some... whattaya call 'em -- DAVID Ambassadors. JACK Right! You guys gotta be embastards and tell 'em we're on strike! KID BLINK I'll take Harlem! RACETRACK I got mid-town!        CRUTCHY The Bronx!                MUSH I'll get da Bowery! Bumlet, Specs, Skittery take Queens; Pie Eater and Snotty, the East side -- Snipeshooter, go with 'em; okay, who wants Brooklyn? Spot Conlon's territory? Maybe the kid'll soften him up a little.  So's your ol' lady! Tell Pulitzer he needs an appointment with me! The doors slam shut; Denton scribbles, intrigued.  -- So this snooty mug is sayin', 'You cawn't see Mr. Pulitzer, no one sees Mr. Pulitzer' -- real hoity-toity, you know the type -- LES  Real hoity-toity -- Not as long as you get it right -- Kelly, Jack Kelly. And, Denton? No pictures. You're movin' up in the world, Spot -- got a ocean view and everything. Spot and Jack exchange ""heh-hehs.""   David's getting more nervous. Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty- boy --  -- or maybe you traded 'em to some chicken for that beak of yours.  Maybe you gotta show me you ain't afraid to join the strike. Murder's in the air: David and Boots are paralyzed; the henchmen are ready to explode. Spot's eyes are locked on Jack's for an excruciating moment -- then Spot grins. SPOT Nice try, pal. But that's just what I'm talkin' about.  Show me this strike ain't just some kids do-or-dare, then we'll talk. At least somebody's got the right idea. PIE EATER Who else is ready for stick-ball? He tears the sign off the stick and swings it like a bat. JACK Who we kiddin' here. Spot was right. Just a game to these guys... The House of Refuge... my home- sweet-home... Whattayasay, Tenpin.   You got a new guy, Crutchy -- That's Tenpin -- s'posed to get out last Christmas but Snyder keeps tackin' more time on his sentence -- Go get your hat, Crutch -- kiss Snyder good-bye. CRUTCHY  Yeah... hey, shoulda seen me in court today -- old Judge Movealong Monahan hisself! Took him two minutes to move me along to Snyder for 'my own good.' JACK Later, Crutchy -- get your stuff. Crutchy stops Jack's hand prying at the bars. CRUTCHY Listen, Jack... truth is, I ain't walkin' so good. Oscar and Morris kinda worked me over a little... JACK They hurt you...? Don't worry, we'll carry you -- CRUTCHY  I don't want nobody carryin' me -- never! Crutchy won't last in there... I seen stronger guys than him not make it. We got money, Medda.      Some, anyway. Medda's gotta look out for herself same as anybody. We'll find another place. DAVID How can they make a whole city afraid? We're the ones putting our necks on the line -- all we need is for somebody to have the guts to stand up and show them we're not alone! MEDDA They have the power to destroy people... Didn't wanna disturb nobody... anyway, it's like the Waldorf out here... great view, cool air -- Your mom and pop are worried about me...?  You'd like it out there -- they got this big yellow desert and the air's real blue, see, from the sky, and the sun, it's bigger out there. SARAH  It's the same sun as here. JACK No.  No, it ain't...  Not that I been there or nothin'. SARAH Guess your parents wrote you about it. Bet you can't wait to see them again.  Sure... big family reunion. Soon's I get the dough for train fare. Not that I blame you -- me bein' such an interestin' guy and all -- What'd I tell ya -- interestin', right? Sarah giggles.       The leaflet gyrates in the wind as we GO TO -- Hey, Denton -- sit down front! You're the guest of honor! Carryin' the banner! AUDIENCE  Carryin' the banner! The noise threatens to blow the roof off the theater as we see -- We come a long way but we ain't there yet -- and maybe it's only gonna get tougher from now on! That means we get tougher too -- (as a huge roar goes up) -- it also means we get smarter! That's why we're gonna listen to my pal David and stop soakin' the scabs -- SEVERAL IN CROWD No!    They asked for it -- etc. That's right -- start fightin' each other! Prove what the big shots say is true -- we're street rats with no brains and no respect for nothin' -- includin' ourselves!  Here's how it is: we don't stick together, we're nothin'. We don't trust each other, we're nothin'. We don't act together, we're nothin' -- and we might as well go back to the streets where we belong. What's it gonna be?  Whattaya say, Spot? SPOT I say -- -- Like demandin' you give us the food you steal from us -- SNYDER -- Followed by an additional six months for an attempted escape -- JACK  -- Last time wasn't no attempt, remember, Snyder? Me and Teddy Roosevelt wavin' bye-bye -- SNYDER -- Therefore, I ask that he be returned to the House of Refuge -- JACK -- For my own good, right, Movealong? -- and for what Snyder kicks back to ya -- SNYDER -- And that the court order his incarceration until the age of twenty-one -- Very impressive. So where do they keep the trains in this station? Seitz shows   him into an elegant library. Snyder tries to follow but   Seitz stops him, closing the doors. Inside, Jack looks   around to see the imposing figure of Pulitzer staring at   him, framed by luxurious furnishings. For a moment, the   two just stare at each other. Then --  Sorry to see you ain't doin' so good, Joe.                                             * Ring for my coach, willya?   It's past my bedtime -- I told ya... I can't call off the strike. You go to jail, what happens to your family? You don't know nothin' about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you gotta get outta here -- Just go! SANTA FE MY OLD FRIEND I CAN'T SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE HIDIN' YOU'RE THE ONLY LIGHT THAT'S GUIDIN' ME TODAY Jack looks up as the serving panel opens and Crutchy peers through, offering him something furtively: a boiled potato. CRUTCHY Snitched it offa Snyder's plate when I was servin' him -- the biggest one! (as Jack shakes his head, looks away) Snyder was eatin' good tonight -- the stuff we don't never get?                            * Patatas... olives...  ... liver and bacon. Sauerkraut...  Guess what I done to his sauerkraut.  So what's it git'cha? We was beat when we was born. Crutchy, concerned, hears something and closes the panel. Guess I can't be somethin' I ain't. DAVID A scab...?                                                  * Nah.    Smart.                                              * I got no choice. I stay here, they lock me up 'til I'm twenty- one. All them sweatshop kids are listenin' to me...? Whattaya need to start a paper? Writers, right? So we got Denton. What else? Les. Go set me straight with the Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet us later at the World Building. So happens I know a guy with a printing press. They're  right above us -- and if Weasel  catches us, it won't be just me  they'll throw in the slammer  -- They can barely hear over the DIN of the PRESSES. DON'T YOU BUMMERS GET WHAT I'M SAYIN' THIS AIN'T HIDE AND SEEK THAT        * WE'RE PLAYIN' ONE FALSE STEP AND THEY'LL BE IN HERE ONE STRAY HAIR, THEY'LL KNOW WE BEEN HERE QUESTIONS -- IT'S TOO LATE FOR 'EM ANSWERS -- WE CAN'T WAIT FOR 'EM WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN It ain't about money, Dave -- if Joe gives in, that would mean nothin's like us got power. He can't let that happen -- no matter what it costs him. Right, Joe? PULITZER I'm about to show you what power really is... He slams the window shut; CROWD NOISE abruptly DROPS -- Ya got me, Joe -- but tell me one thing, willya? How'd ya like our paper -- nice printin', ain't it? Right off the presses of one of New York's greatest newspapers -- Not enough, Joe -- you gotta deal with our demands. Otherwise, our lips are sealed. We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.' (as he stares, stunned) And Hearst and them other owners? Maybe they don't have to know. Depends. The strike's over -- we beat 'em! What're you talkin' about -- who come chargin' in? Think he could drop me at the train yards? It's now or never, Racetrack. Maybe that's what scares me... Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns, runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards the coach. Les starts after him -- David catches him, holds him, as he and Sarah watch --"

She smiles. Time for the tender approach. She touches his hand.  Stop calling me 'honey'. Bit it's gonna take me another- year to finish my novel. . .and what if it doesn't get published? But what if it doesn't? Are you gonna take care of me until I'm old and grey, working on my 25th unpublished novel?...  Hi, Dad. They hold each other for a second. Lynn closes the front door. Rand picks up Mogwai's case. Lynn turn's to her husband.  What is it? A.monkey? A rat?. What's that? Sounds kind of creepy. Barney still growls.  Maybe later. Little bastard. Mogwai scurries back to Rand. He pets the creature, comforting it Shut up. Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing. Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles up to Billy's arm. He jumps back. Get off of me. Mogwai just looks at him. Get.off`my desk. Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor. Billy looks down at the creature. Stay down there. Billy goes back to his work. Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the floor. Billy turns. Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened. Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.  You stupid little... Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill the tiny creature. Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery. Billy suddenly feels sympathetic. He lowers the sword and picks up the.creature. Starting work early today? We've got a half hour before work. Wanna go have a cup of coffee? She.pauses and smiles. .and if I sell the novel, I'll be able to quit the bank. Why Paris? Hey...Don't give up on your dreams. They just might come true. Tracy shrugs and takes a sip of coffee. Can I ask you a personal question?  What is it with you and Gary? Is he your boyfriend? Do you think he is? So there's a possibility...I mean... I.just might have a chance with you? Want some? A present from my Dad. Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai. I dunno, Pete... They must only multiply with plain tap water.  Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high, piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature and bring it back to their group. Dad...We don't know anything about these things. Yeah, but isn't that pretty weird? I mean, if I throw water onBarney over there, we're not gonna;getjten copies. A creature licks Rand's ear. He chuckles. Huh?  Oh, Christ. C'mo'i,Dad...that's ... Don't you think we should have them checked out first? Just to make sure... Oh, hi Gary. Look, I'm kind of in a hurry. Gary grabs Billy by the collar and throws him against the car. Well, you're the closest thing this town's got to a scientist... and I need some information about an animal. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Watch this. Billy squeezes a drop of water on one creature. Mogwa' lets out a scream. A lump appears on the creature's back. The lump gets bigger...bigger...bigger ... Roy watches with wide eyes. Suddenly, another creature bursts from Mogwai's body. NINE IDENTICAL CREATURES now stand on the desk top. (nods, checks his Anything else? Forget it. Billy stares coldly at his Father. Embarrassed, Rand looks away. Damn things are stuck to the floor. Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head and swings down, hard. Against the pod. The bat snaps in two. The pod is unblemished. Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look at each other. Puzzled. Why did they attack my dog? Screw'science. I want them des- troyed.  Dad, they killed Barney. Or have you already forgotten? Rand just looks'at his son. Lynn pops a valium in the background. Now what do we do? I don't think we should wait. Let's do it ourselves. Next.  Hello, Mrs. Deagle. How are you this afternoon? (trying to stay  Mrs. Deagle, I... Mrs. Deagle, I... (He can't do it. He lets out his honest feelings) I think you're an-ugly old fart and I; hope yo u fall down on the ice a td breath your fucking neck! Mrs. Deagle is sho ked. fi e other customers hide their laughter. Gary smiles. Tracy is proud. Yeah?... Mom...stay downstairs. I'll be right home. He drops the phone and runs out of the bank. Gary exchanges a puzzled glance with Tracy. Nervous. Sweating. Behind the wheel of his car. He tries to drive fast, but the heavy snowfall and icy roads prevent it. Outside, the sun is going down. still driving. He tries to pass a slow truck. He hits a is spot. tries to start it. Nothing happens. It's stalled. No...Not now... He tries again. No good. It's dead. Frustrated, Billy slams his fist on the steering wheel. sprints down his driveway. He arrives at the porch of his home. He opens the front door. Mom?.. Scattered giggling echoes from inside. Billy flips on the'front hall..light.. A few tiny shadows scatter. They dash into other rooms. Afraid of the light. Billy'slowly enters. He's scared. He looks to the top of the stairs. Mom?... More giggling. Shaking'. Nervous. Billy climbs the stairs. At the top, he quickly flips on the bright hall light. Something darts up into the darkness of the attic. Escap- ing the light. Billy spots the open attic door. He walks beneath it. He looks up into the dark attic. He clutches his sword. Tight. Two creatures leap at him. He spears one in mid-air. He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood. The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg. It takes a bite from his calf. Billy cries out in pair. Mogwai stays on. Biting hard. Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace. Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go. Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to a crisp. Billy removes his steaming sword. The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead. Billy checks his leg. A small bite. He walks to the kitchen. Yes, could you connect me with the Sheriff's Office?... Hello? ...Is this Sheriff Lucia?...  Hello?... It hisses. running through the snow. Following Mogwai's footprints. running through the backyards, following Mogwai's footprints The carolers' singing echoes in the distance. running to the group of carolers. They are puzzled by the.sword in his hand, his tattered, bloody appearance. But they continue singing. Billy follows the creatures' footprints behind the carolers , into the woods. Several feet away, Billy so-es Mogwai The creature is on top of,Pete's body Billy rushes, to the scene. Mogwai sees Billy. The creature gets scared and dashes off. Billy stops chasing the creature through the snow covered woods. know you're here. The flashlight stops on the gymnasium light box. The box is attached to a.farwall, beside. the swimming pool. Colme on out...you bastard... It is silent again. Billy is frightened. He walks faster, moving to the light box. Billy hears another sound. He shines the light to another area. Again. Nothing. Billy starts to tremble. He runs to the light box. gets there and quickly flips open the box. Billy drops the flashlight and sword. The creature's sharp fingernails clutch onto Billy's chest. Billy falls backward, with Mogwai holding onto him. They tumble into the swimming pool. The deep end. watches from the doorway. runs outof thegymnasium. sits in front of the two men. A serious, helpless look covers his face. Frank leans toward Billy. Yes... that's right... (nods, displaying the bite on his It wasn't a dog, sir. My Mother is dead. So is my friend. I am not imagining things. Billy glares at Frank. The Sheriff sighs. He looks at Officer Brent.  Sheriff... you should radio for more help. . .warn the people in They're inside. Brent checks his pistol. It's loaded. Look...You can't go in there alone. It's'suicide. You've got to radio for more help... waits in the car. Frightened. Restless. He hears the gunshots. He moves faster, desperately hacking at the handcuff chain with his sword. Sweating. Nervous. Hacking away at the handcuff chain. Brent's screams fade in the background. Billy looks out the side window. He sees panics. He hacks at the chain. Harder. Faster. finally breaks the handcuff chain. He quickly moves to the driver's seat and starts the car. drives faster. steers the patrol car into the first driveway. The car screeches to a stop. Billy gets out. Sword in hand, he runs to the front door of the house. He knocks. Hard.  You've got to keep your wind ws locked. Or better yet...boa d them up! And your lights... You've got to leave them on! f+ MR. FUTTERS What are you talking about, boy? There are these little things... animals...They're all over the place! They'll kill you and your family!... Mr. Futters starts to laugh. No sir, I...

He squeals out of the driveway. Shaky. Nervous. Behind the wheel of the police car. looks through his windshield. Up ahead, he sees steers the police car into her driveway. He squeals to a stop. He grabs his sword and gets out of the car. Tracy!...It's me! Billy! I'll get him out. Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out. He's dead. Tears fill Gary's eyes. Billy leads Gary to the car. C'mon. Just stay in the light. They're afraid of the light. Gary walks. He looks scared. Helpless. They get to the police car. Billy opens the door. We're just outside of town... Doesn't look like the creature's got here yet.  Let's go inside and warm up. They exit the police car. .and they originate from this marketplace in Hong Kong. Dorrystands and shakes his head.  You see...they''re drawn to water. Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll be leaving town, and heading for the water tower-which means they'll have to pass by here tonight.  We have to get help. These things have to be kept under control. If they get to the water tower .they could spread all over the St ate... maybe the Country. They're like inhuman divining rods. I did. But nobody would listen. That's not true. That isn't.. Yeah, and then I'd like to try and get in touch with my Dad. If we can... They're here. A frightened Gary holds Tracy. Do you have a place without win dows?... .A place where we could be safe? Dorry pauses to think.  We have to hurry. Dorry leads everyone.out of the.room... We'll stay ere until daybreak. Gary sits with Tracy on an old sofa. Dorry sits beside them in anold rocking chair. Billy pulls up an old wooden'chair. Help me with this. Gary and Billy slide the cabinet in front of the door. That'llkeep them out. We're safe now.. Billy sits back. The oipjs contipue. Dorrylook at ever y on Well...I think you should all try and get some sleep.  I'll watch the door. Everyone agrees. Billy moves his chair in front of the door. .Dorry relaxes.inhis rocking chair. Gary stretches out on the sofa, expecting Tracy to cuddle with him. Instead,""she walks:over to Billy. sleeping in his chair. His hand still holds the sword on his lap. The others are asleep. Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword. Everyone else wakes from the sound.  Everything's okay...I just dropped my sword. Gary rubs his eyes. Try. the phone. .see if we can get help... Dorry walks back inside. Gary flips on a transistor radio that has been sitting on the shelf. Damn. How? The nearest town is fifteen miles away. In this? You won't get far. And-what happens when it gets dark? ...And you're on the road. Alone. Gary says nothing. No. We have to stick together and fight these things. At least until we can get help... Tracy folds her arms. Okay. We 11 get something to eat. , Them we go 1 to wJork. It's.possible. But it's more important to get at the creatures. We've got the advantage now. It's daylight. No...But they're all gathered in one place. And the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower. So they must be holed up between here and there.  Too many windows. Too much light. it's got to be someplace dark. Totally dark. No. There's too many of them.. They'd need a huge area... You used to work here, right? You're coming in with me., You can show me around. Blow up the theater. Everyone seems puzzled. Billy turns to Gary. This place has some kind of boiler room...with a furnace... right?  I'll use the gas lines as a bomb. The fire will destroy the creatures. Dorry looks at Billy. Okay...just remember;.We've got to stick together. And keep close to the flashlight. They're scared of the light. Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight. Tracy takes Billy's hand. Gary is jealous. They enter the theater. They're inside the theater. The others peer into the window.  How do we get to the boiler room? Damn. There's too many of those things. They'll- see us. Give me your T-shirt. Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the two shirts together. He winds them into a cord. He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds of metal ring out. We have to get out. Fast. Gary points to a rear exit. Not your gun. There's too many. Use the light. Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight. A creature leaps atDorry, pinning the old man to the ground. Other creatures attack Dorry. Biting. Scratching. Tearing. Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures off Dorry. Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai. Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some of the Mogwai at bay. Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas line. Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry. More creatures come through the door. Gary gets scared. He drops the flashlight and runs for the rear exit.  Get back here! We need you! .Gary runs out, leaving the others alone. Billy and Tracy continue to fight the creatures. Let's go. Billy picks up Dorry's body. Tracy protects him by batting away any oncoming creatures. They hurry out of the boiler room. You bastard. You ran out on us. Left us alone. To die. Billy drops his sword and jumps Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting. Punching. Wait... He looks out the rear window. looks at the creature on the back seat. It still cries out in that high pitched scream.  Hear that? He's calling his friends for help. They're following us. As long as he's alive and screaming... they'll come after him. We can't kill him. He's our bait. We'll be able to lead them away from the water tower. (points to the back seat) Just keep an eye on the thing... make s re it doe n' hurt us. Tracy keeps the swo d on the cre ture. Billy guns the engine and screeches off. He looks to the rearview mirror. We'd better hurry. They're getting close. They.. get into the car.. Where in the hell?...  Check the garage... ee if there's a bag...a b x... something we can keep this little bastard locked up in. Tracyhurries to the garage. grabs the creature. Mogwai is still wounded and dazed. But it manages to bite and scratch at Billy. Tracy holds the tool box open. Billy forces Mogwai inside. He closes the tool box and locks it shut. Mogwai is trapped inside. The creature pounds against the metal. Its loud cry echoes from inside. Billy checks the car's engine. Damn! He ripped out the coil wires! The car won't run without them! There's no time. (grabs her He lies in bed. His wounds are bandaged. An I.V. needle is in his arm. How's Tracy? Oh my God! No!...No!... The tool box! It's locked! I didn't open it!...It's dark inside!... (fighting,"
gandhi,GANDHI ,Ben Kingsley," Oh, God... oh, God... Tell me -- do you think about hell?  but this man is a Christian and he has written --  A -- a week. Why -- I -- I have a ticket. A First Class ticket. I sent for it in the post. I'm an attorney, and I didn't have time to -- No, no -- just a moment, please. You see, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Attorney at Law. I am going to Pretoria to conduct a case for an Indian trading firm. Sir, I was called to the bar in London and enrolled in the High Court of Chancery -- I am therefore an attorney, and since I am -- in your eyes -- colored -- I think we can deduce that there is at least one colored attorney in South Africa.  I always go First Class! I have traveled all over England and I've never... But you're a rich man -- why do you put up with it? In England, I was a poor student but I -- This part of ""England's"" Empire! But that is very un-Christian. You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him? Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else. I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England. (He turns to Baker firmly) And I will use the courts. We are members of the Empire. And we come from an ancient civilization. Why should we not walk on the pavements like other men? There's the English reporter. I told you he'd come. No. I asked my wife to organize that. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have asked you to gather here to help us proclaim our right to be treated as equal citizens of the Empire. We do not seek conflict. We know the strength of the forces arrayed against us, know that because of them we can only use peaceful means -- but we are determined that justice will be done! The symbol of our status is embodied in this pass -- which we must carry at all times, but no European even has to have. And the first step to changing our status is to eliminate this difference between us. You saved the papers. I hated that -- all the pettiness, the little corruptions.  And I was more laughing stock than lawyer. But they needed me here. If I'd never been thrown off that train, perhaps no one would ever have needed me.  ""A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest."" -- I told you about English law. Yes? And I am glad to be back. (He holds his hands out to Ramdas.) Come... Tomorrow I will tell you what it feels like to be a jailbird. Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them. Hm. Will you take this off? (he touches the bandage on his cheek) It pinches every time I speak. Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- ""a monstrous attack.""  Yes -- I can't talk like this. Pull! Oww! If you would let me teach you to read, you could see for yourself. It proves what I told you. If I had prosecuted him as everyone advised -- even you -- they would have hated me -- by showing forgiveness I -- ouch!  You see there is such a thing as moral force -- and it can be harnessed. I am. I am convinced the holy men are right. When you give up, you gain. The simpler your life the better. I will fast tomorrow -- as a penance. I'm sorry. Some of it good, I hope.  Would you care to walk?  You're a clergyman. Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or -- Doesn't the New Testament say, ""If your enemy strikes you on the right cheek, offer him the left""? I'm not so certain. I have thought about it a great deal. I suspect he meant you must show courage -- be willing to take a blow -- several blows -- to show you will not strike back -- nor will you be turned aside... And when -- ...and when you do that it calls upon something in human nature -- something that makes his hate for you diminish and his respect increase. I think Christ grasped that and I -- I have seen it work. Good morning. You'll find there's room for us both. I thought you were a man of God. ...you could call it a ""communal farm,"" I suppose. But we've all come to the same conclusion -- our Gita, the Muslim's Koran or your Bible -- it's always the simple things that catch your breath -- ""Love thy neighbor as thyself"" -- (He smiles, thinking back at the youths.) not always practiced -- but it's something we Hindus could learn a lot from.  Well, we shall try. ...so it's not ""spiritualism"" or ""nationalism"" -- we're not against anything but the idea that people can't live together. You see -- Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jews -- even Christians. Mr. Walker! Of The New York Times! Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession. I don't know... I'm still searching for a ""response.""  There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men. If you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth. This is Mr. Kallenbach. He is our chief carpenter -- and also our chief benefactor. He has made this experiment possible. That's right. The word only means ""community."" But it could stand for ""village""... or the world.  I hope not.  Ba -- we will need another place set for Mr. Walker's driver. It's one way to learn that each man's labor is as important as another's. In fact when you're doing it, ""cleaning the outhouse"" seems far more important than the law. Please come and join us -- you'll need something before your journey back.  Excuse me a moment. What is it? Everyone takes his turn. In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us! All the more reason. It's not me. It's the principle. And you will do it with joy or not do it at all! All right, go! You don't belong here! Go! Leave the ashram! Get out altogether! We don't want you! What is the matter with me...? I apologize... I must go back to that reporter.  I want to welcome you all! Every one of you.  We -- have -- no -- secrets. Let us begin by being clear about General Smuts's new law. All Indians must now be fingerprinted -- like criminals. Men and women. (A rising, angry response; Gandhi just waits.) No marriage other than a Christian marriage is considered valid. Under this Act our wives and mothers are whores... And every man here a bastard. And a policeman passing an Indian dwelling -- I will not call them homes -- may enter and demand the card or any Indian woman whose dwelling it is. Understand! He does not have to stand at the door -- he may enter. I praise such courage. I need such courage -- because in this cause, I too am prepared to die... (A response; he looks at Tyeb Mohammed) But, my friend, there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill. I have asked you here tonight because despite all their troops and police, I think there is a way to defeat this law. Whatever they do to us we will attack no one, kill no one... But we will not  give our fingerprints -- not one of us. They will imprison us, they will fine us. They will seize our possessions. But they cannot take away our self-respect if we do not give it to them. I am asking you to fight -- ! (It catches the audience a little, holds them.) To fight against their anger -- not to provoke it! We will not strike a blow -- but we will receive them. And through our pain we will make them see their injustice  and it will hurt, as all fighting hurts!  ...But we cannot lose. We cannot. (He looks down at the police.) Because they may torture my body, may break my bones, even kill me...  They will then have my dead body -- not my obedience. We are Hindu and Muslim -- children of God, each of us. Let us take a solemn oath in His name that -- come what may -- we will not submit to this law.  God save our gracious King... Long live our (the audience takes it up) ...noble King. (And their voices fill the auditorium) God save the King!! You have put their comrades in jail. When you free them they will go back to work. We have warned each other. Lie down! Lie down! Lie down! Lie down! They're sparing no one, I see. So did I. My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others. It's split the Government. If we hold firm, it won't be the last. Thank you. No.  I dined at the prison.  Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done. Somehow I expected not. Very well.  I congratulate them. Immigration was not an issue on which we fought. It would be wrong of us to make it one now that we -- we are in a position of advantage.  I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment. Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi. I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.  Well -- now that this is settled -- I had thought seriously of going back to India (he faces the startled Daniel) but a shilling will do splendidly for the moment. Thank you.  Thank you both for a very enlightening experience.  I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels, but I will find my own way out. No, no, I haven't ""refused""... I -- I simply wanted to dress the way my comrades in prison dressed. I -- I have demanded rights as a British citizen, it is therefore my duty to help in the defense of the British Empire. I don't know... I don't know... I -- I am glad to be home. (A little round of applause.) I -- I thank you for your greeting. Who is that young man? I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.  No.  Yes... I'm sure... It is a clever argument; I am not sure it will produce the end you desire.  I --  I have much to learn about India. And I have to begin my practice again -- one needs money to run a journal. I have little to say. India is an ""alien"" country to me.  I ask you to pray for those who died.  For the English soldiers...  who were doing what they thought was right.  And for the brave terrorists whose patriotism led them to do what was wrong. It is not my law, it is the law of creation. We reap what we sow. Out there in the fields -- and in our hearts. Violence sows hatred, and the will to revenge. In them. And in us. There's no room! And the air is lovely. Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.  What are you doing? Let go! You'll kill him! Let go! Let go!  Charlie!! I am flattered by Mr. Patel  I would be even more flattered if what he said were true. Since I returned from South Africa, I have traveled over much of India. And I know I could travel many more years and still only see a small part of it. ...and yet already I know what we say here means nothing to the masses of our country. Here we make speeches for each other -- and those English liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines. But the people of India are untouched. Their politics are confined to bread and salt. Illiterate they may be, but they are not blind. They see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men who simply want to take over the role of the British in the name of freedom. This Congress tells the world it represents India. My brothers, India is seven hundred thousand ""villages"" not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi and Bombay. Until we stand in the fields with the millions who toil each day under the hot sun, we will not represent India -- nor will we ever be able to challenge the British as one nation. I try to live like an Indian, as you see... it is stupid of course, because in our country it is the British who decide how an Indian lives -- what he may buy, what he may sell. And from their luxury in the midst of our terrible poverty they instruct us on what is justice and what is sedition. (He looks at them, a teasing but mordant grin.) So it is only natural that our best young minds assume an air of Eastern dignity, while greedily assimilating every Western weakness as quickly as they can acquire it. Would you, please? And why should the English grant us Home Rule? Here, we must take the peelings to the goats. We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere. Just spread it around -- they like the new peelings mixed with the rotting ones. Where there is injustice, I've always believed in fighting.  The question is do you fight to change things, or do you fight to punish.  For myself, I have found that we are all such sinners we should leave punishment to God. And if we really want to change things there are better ways of doing it than by derailing trains or slashing someone with a sword. You see, even here we live under tyranny. My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. Gandhi.  They seem to want me. On what charge? I am an Indian traveling in my own country. I see no reason for trouble. I understand. (He examines his hands a moment.) The landlords are British? What we can do... we will try to do. Is all Champaran like this, Shukla? Yes. I am not sorry at all. Charlie-- Not quite. They're only ""holding me"" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison. These are my clothes now.  If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them. I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.  It does. We must be getting old, Charlie. I think, Charlie, that you can help us most by taking that assignment you've been offered in Fiji. I have to be sure -- they have to be sure -- that what we do can be done by Indians... alone. But you know the strategy. The world is full of people who will despise what's happening here. It is their strength we need. Before you go, you could start us in the right direction. When I get the chance. There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie. Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart...  With respect, I refuse to go.  As you wish. I refuse to pay one hundred rupees. Indeed. I want to document, coldly, rationally, what is being done here. It may take months -- many, many months. You will have to live with the peasants.  I have nothing to pay you.  Hmm.  The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend (anticipating Jinnah's objection) and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked. Only the stubborn man of Champaran.  I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.  If I may -- I, for one, have never advocated passive anything. I am with Mr. Jinnah. We must never submit to such laws -- ever. And I think our resistance must be active and provocative. I want to embarrass all those who wish to treat us as slaves. All of them. Forgive my stupid illustration. But I want to change their minds -- not kill them for weaknesses we all possess. The law is due to take effect from April sixth. I want to call on the nation to make that a day of prayer and fasting.  I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop. Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live. You too... Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...  I've never spoken for anything else. If you will excuse me, Your Excellency, it is our view that matters have gone beyond ""legislation."" We think it is time you recognized that you are masters in someone else's home. (It chills, stiffens; Gandhi proceeds only an iota softer) Despite the best intentions of the best of you, you must, in the nature of things, humiliate us to control us. General Dyer is but an extreme example of the principle. It is time you left.  Mr. Kinnoch, I beg you to accept that there is no people on earth who would not prefer their own bad government to the ""good"" government of an alien power. All nations contain religious minorities. Like other countries, ours will have its problems.  But they will be ours -- not yours. Yes... in the end you will walk out. Because one hundred thousand Englishmen simply cannot control three hundred fifty million Indians if the Indians refuse to co-operate. And that is what we intend to achieve -- peaceful, non-violent, non-co- operation. Until you yourself see the wisdom of leaving... your Excellency. My message tonight is the message I have given to your brothers everywhere. To gain independence we must prove worthy of it. There must be Hindu-Muslim unity -- always.  Secondly, no Indian must be treated as the English treat us so we must remove untouchability from our lives, and from our hearts. Third -- we must defy the British. Not with violence that will inflame their will, but with firmness that will open their eyes. English factories make the cloth -- that makes our poverty.  All those who wish to make the English see, bring me the cloth from Manchester and Leeds that you wear tonight, and we will light a fire that will be seen in Delhi -- and London! And if, like me, you are left with only one piece of homespun -- wear it with dignity!  Eleven. Sardar... What you've done is a miracle. You have made all India proud.  Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge. Well, we can't expect miracles all the time. (Then to Azad, more soberly) Your news I understand is not so good. Come, come -- you will be my daughter... Is the campaign weakening? They are not alone. And martial law only shows how desperate the British are. Is that homespun? Or cotton from Leeds? What do the workers in England make of what we're doing? It must have produced hardship. Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too. First spin. Let the others march for a time.  We must end the campaign.  We must stop. If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.  Tell that to the families of the policemen who died. I will ask. And I will fast as penance for my part in arousing such emotions -- and I will not stop until they stop. If I die, perhaps they will... When it is everywhere, then my prayers will be answered. Do you find me stubborn?  When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible. But in the end they always fall. Think of it -- always... When you are in doubt that that is God's way, the way the world is meant to be... think of that.  And then -- try to do it His way. (A tear runs down Mirabehn's face. She touches his shoulder. Gandhi just leans his head back in exhaustion.) And now -- could I have another feast of lemon juice?  Perhaps -- perhaps I have overdone it. Good morning.  Don't let her go. If she bumps me I am done for. Panditji -- please, help me. You must help Herman -- and Ba. (He releases her, and says more loudly to the others) I have been on many trips -- it is just another trip. I am at your command.  If there is one protest -- one riot -- a disgrace of any kind, I will fast again.  I know India is not ready for my kind of independence. If I am sent to jail, perhaps that is the best protest our country can make at this time. And if it helps India, I have never refused to take His Majesty's hospitality. Not at all.  And I will save the Court's time, M'Lord, by stating under oath that to this day I believe non-co-operation with evil is a duty. And that British rule of India is evil. I have no defense, My Lord. I am guilty as charged.  And if you truly believe in the system of law you administer in my country, you must inflict on me the severest penalty possible.  ""Take a fourth step, that we may be ever full of joy."" ""Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."" ""Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life.""  ""Take the seventh step, that we may ever live as friends."" Then I put a sweetened wheat cake in her mouth. And with that we were pronounced man and wife.  We were both thirteen... Even as a boy I thought so. And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen? Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.  Do you remember much of South Africa? I've traveled so far -- and thought so much. (He smiles in self- mockery, and turns toward the city.) As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped. When I was a boy I used to sing a song in that temple: ""A true disciple knows another's woes as his own. He bows to all and despises none... Earthly possessions hold him not."" Like all boys I said the words, not thinking of what they meant or how they might be influencing me. (He looks at Walker... then out to the sea again, shaking his head.) I've traveled so far... and all I've done is come back home. It would have been very uncivil of me to let you make such a long trip for nothing. I'm going back to the ashram  and then I'm going to prove to the new Viceroy that the King's writ no longer runs in India!  ...the real test will come if I am arrested. If there is violence we lose all our moral advantage. This time it mustn't happen. If I'm taken, Maulana is to lead the march. If he is arrested, Patel, then Kripalani, then yourself. I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles. I have two of them bossing me now. And Jinnah?  Wait and see... wait and see...  You've done me a great service. Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns. Do you still have your notebook? (Walker fumbles for it; Gandhi goes right on talking.) The function of a civil resister is to provoke response. And we will continue to provoke until they respond, or they change the law. They are not in control -- we are. That is the strength of civil resistance. Are you going to walk all the way?  ""My name is Walk-er""... Man needs salt as he needs air and water. This salt comes from the Indian Ocean. (The salt crystals are added to an urn already partially full. The camera pulls back and Gandhi lifts the urn. All around him the pressing crowd: newsreel cameramen, reporters -- Walker, Collins, Naidu, Pyarelal. Firmly) Let every Indian claim it as his right!! I am aware that I must have given you much cause for irritation, your Excellency. I hope it will not stand between us as men.  Do I speak into that? Are they ready? Do I start? I am glad to speak to America where so many friends exist that I know only in my heart.  I think your interest and the world's has fallen on India, not only because we are struggling for freedom, but because the way we are doing so is unique as far as history shows us. Here in Europe mighty nations are, it seems, already contemplating another war, though I think they, and all the world, are sick to death of bloodspilling. All of us are seeking a way out, and I flatter myself that perhaps the ancient land of India will offer such a way. If we are to make progress we must not repeat history, but make history. And I myself will die before I betray our belief that love is a stronger weapon than hate. It is only a sprain. Take her to the river, and we'll make a mud-pack for her. Go -- I won't be long. They are only clinging to old dreams (looks up from his spinning to Jinnah) and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when (another glance at Jinnah) and how. They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger. No. That is just another way of striking back. We have come a long way together with the British. When they leave we want to see them off as friends. (He starts down the steps and heads for the river.) And now, if you'll excuse me, there is something I must attend to. The value of goat's milk in daily diet.  But you can be sure I will also speak against war. Yes, I have heard of Life Magazine.  I have even heard of Margaret Bourke- White. But I don't know why either should be interested in an old man sitting in prison when the world is blowing itself to pieces. Ah, but for me that's not much of an accomplishment. No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison. I have a friend who keeps telling me how much it costs him to keep me in poverty.  But I know happiness does not come with things -- even twentieth century things. It can come from work, and pride in what you do. (He looks at her steadily.) It will not necessarily be ""progress"" for India if she simply imports the unhappiness of the West.  Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain? (For a moment the thought hangs, and then Gandhi takes their hands back to the spinning.) What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.  No. That is what you get for distracting me.  I expect you to show as much patience as I am now. Every enemy is a human being -- even the worst of them. And he believes he is right and you are a beast. (And now a little smile.) And if you beat him over the head you will only convince him. But you suffer, to show him that he is wrong, your sacrifice creates an atmosphere of understanding -- if not with him, then in the hearts of the rest of the community on whom he depends. If you are right, you will win -- after much pain. (He looks at her, then smiles in his own ironic way.) If you are wrong, well, then, only you will suffer the blows. It is time for my walk -- I won't be long.  Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master. Thank God, they've stopped. I'm your grand uncle but I can still walk either of you into the ground and I don't need to be pampered this way! Finish your quota of spinning.  What do you want me not to do? Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?  I am a Muslim! (He stares at them, then relents.) And a Hindu, and a Christian and a Jew -- and so are all of you. When you wave those flags and shout you send fear into the hearts of your brothers. This is not the India I want. Stop it. For God's sake, stop it. My dear Jinnah, you and I are brothers born of the same Mother India. If you have fears, I want to put them to rest. (Jinnah listens impatiently, skeptically. Gandhi just glances in Nehru's direction.) I am asking Panditji to stand down. I want you to be the first Prime Minister of India (Jinnah raises an eyebrow of interest.) -- to name your entire cabinet, to make the head of every government department a Muslim.  I don't want to hear more... There is nothing I can give. Calcutta. I am staying with the friend of a friend. Because forgiveness is the gift of the brave.  Go -- do as your mother and father would wish you to do. I have lived a lifetime. If I had shunned death -- or feared it -- I would not be here. Nor would you be concerned for me. (He lets it sink in then he takes the commissioner's arm and moves back toward the center of the roof.) Leave me -- and take your men. (An understanding touch of the arm.) You have more important things to worry about. And with you. (He touches her wrinkled hand.) Pray... I cannot help you -- pray... pray. Sardar...  You have gained weight. You must join me in the fast. All that has happened is that I've grown a little thinner. I'm glad -- but it will not be enough. Don't worry for me -- death will be a deliverance. (There is water in his eyes, but his words have the weight of a man truly determined to die.) I cannot watch the destruction of all I have lived for. Each night before I sleep, I read a few words from the Gita and the Koran, and the Bible... (we intercut with Bourke-White and those on the roof watching) tonight I ask you to share these thoughts of God with me.  I will begin with the Bible where the words of the Lord are, ""Love thy neighbor as thyself""... and then our beloved Gita which says, ""The world is a garment worn by God, thy neighbor is in truth thyself""... and finally the Holy Koran, ""We shall remove all hatred from our hearts and recline on couches face to face, a band of brothers.""  That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again. Go -- try -- God by with you. Only God decides who goes to hell...  Why? Why? I know a way out of hell. Find a child -- a child whose mother and father have been killed. A little boy -- about this high. ...and raise him -- as your own. Only be sure... that he is a Muslim. And that you raise him as one.  Go -- go. God bless you... It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man. Maulana, my friend, could I have some orange juice... Then you and I will take a piece of bread together... That is how you eat muli.  I'm not sure I want to be remembered that way.  I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought. Not a very good one. That's why I have so much tolerance for the other scoundrels of the world. Ask Panditji to -- to consider what we've discussed.  Enough. You're a temptress. Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man. Allah be with you. Oh, God... oh, God...  ...There have been tyrants and murderers -- and for a time they can seem invincible. But in the end they always fall. Think of it -- always... When you are in doubt that that is God's way, the way the world is meant to be... think of that."
blade,BLADE ,Wesley Snipes," Where is Deacon Frost? Got something in your throat. Frost. Now don't we look dapper? Whistler! She's been bitten. She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.  Just do it, old man. You shouldn't be here. -- he's a vampire. Stupidity. It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her. Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us. Then I have to take you out, just like any other bloodsucker. We hunt them, moving from one city to the next, tracking their migrations. They're hard to kill. They tend to regenerate. I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business. Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that. Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint. Get in. Youre leaving. Remember what we said. Keep your eyes open. They're everywhere. You okay? Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up. It worked, didn't it? He didn't. Get over it. He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark? That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now -- Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them. For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high. How 'bout you, Officer? You a good little bloodhound? Looks like our friend was blood-running.  Where were you headed? Preventive medicine. It's war, now get the fuck out of the way! God-damnit!!! Do you have any idea what you just did?! He'll warn them. They'll be waiting! Let me set you straight on something, Doctor. What you've ""seen"" so far is nothing. The world you live in's just the sugar-coated topping. There's another world beneath it, the real world -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. If you want to survive in it, you'd better pull your head out of your ass. What the hell are you doing?! I could have killed you! Do you have a death wish or are you just stupid? There is no cure.  What do you see here? Look closer. This isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire marking. It means there's a safe-house nearby. A place they can go if dawn is coming. Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door? All right, then, listen up, Vampire Anatomy 101. Crosses and running water don't do dick, so forget what you've seen in the movies. You use the stake, silver, or sunlight, got it? Know how to use one of these? Safety's off, round's already chambered --  Silver hollow-points filled with garlic. You aim for the heart or the head, anything else is a one-way ticket to a pine box. Get out. Now. I know you're blood-running. Who's your sponsor? What's this? A birthmark?  Still think we might be wrong?  How much are you shipping? I've got a message for your masters -- the night's no longer safe for their kind. He will. Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman. The way they move, they way they smell -- The whore on the corner, she's one too. So are the two men standing under the streetlight. There are worse things than vampires out there.  Like me. Where's the entrance?! I got news for you, butt-boy. You're already dead. After you. Some kind of archive -- You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown. This must be where they keep their records -- Frost?  Don't be. You're another notch on my sword hilt, nothing else. A sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty questions. Depending on your answers, you might get to have yourself a tanning session. What were you in such a big hurry to delete just now? And who is LaMagra? Where's the original, Pearl? You must have it around here somewhere. If he moves, cook him. That's the point. I'm expecting some company. He can take care of himself! GO!!! Nothing that won't heal by dawn.  I need help with this --  Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute. Not quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, half-vampire. Don't even start, old man. You get used to the darkness. I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream. I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human. Just get out of here. I said, GET OUT!!! China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?  For your miracle cure? Cancer. We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story. Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card. I'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never put much stock in optimism. How's it going, Kam? I was in the neighborhood. Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it. Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives. Yeah. I know. Thanks, Kam.  One other thing. Have you ever heard of a vampire called the Sleeper? I found this in there archives. I need to find someone who can read their language.  How can you be out here? I don't buy it. Maybe I don't see it that way. You're wrong. Pass. You're not going anywhere. Any progress? You don't look so good. It's started. You've got another day or two at most. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. I'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me. You're blind -- I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated. Who is LaMagra? His blood -- ?  ""The Blood Tide"". How do I stop it? But I just got here -- WHISTLER?! Jesus, Whistler, what did they do to you? Don't try to talk -- No, we can treat the wounds -- Whistler, I can't. Whistler, I -- You should be. I've made some improvements. Mother -- ?! But you -- died -- Fight him -- Please --  I've been better -- How long have we been driving?  We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours. What are you talking about? -- go to hell -- I'd kill myself -- before I turned into something like you. How could you be a part of this? You don't have to be. I don't believe that. Mother! Get out of here -- You don't understand. The Thirst --  -- tearing me -- apart. No -- I can't -- I won't be able to stop -- NO!!!!  Never been better. Frost!!! Who dies first? Let's see if you can grow a new one of these! Next? Where are you?! Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought. You don't have a few minutes, Frost.  It's because I'm human that I can do this. For them. But for me -- I feel like it's finally beginning."

inception,COBB ,Leonardo DiCaprio," What's the most resilient parasite? A bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea's taken hold in the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. A person can cover it up, ignore it- but it stays there. Information, yes. But an idea? Fully formed, understood? That sticks...  In there, somewhere. But, Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor. Because I am the most skilled extractor. I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks, and I can teach them to your subconscious so that even when you're asleep, your guard is never down. But if I'm going to help you, you have to be completely open to me. I'll need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, your analyst, anyone.  If this is a dream and you've got a safe full of secrets, I need to know what's in that safe. For this to work, you have to let me in. I can get it here. The information's in the safe- he looked right at it when I mentioned secrets. You just get to your room. I'll take care of the rest. With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal, why are you here? I am. But I can't trust you anymore. Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to postwar British painters. Would you sit down? You can't imagine. Getting some air. Stay seated. Please. Did she tell you, or have you known all along? No point threatening him in a dream. You came prepared. Hard for a man in your position to keep a love nest totally secret... particularly when there's a married woman involved. And yet, here we are. With a dilemma. Not quite. The key piece of information wasn't there, was it, Mr. Saito? You held something back because you knew what we were up to... So why let us in at all? Audition for what? I extracted all the information you had in there. You know the corporation who hired us won't accept failure. We won't last two days... So now I have to do this the old- fashioned way- We're not in your dream- Lets go. I had it under control. There's no time for this-I'm getting off at Kyoto. I can't stand trains. Every man for himself. Hey, guys. How are you? Who's just okay? Was that James? I can't. Not for a while. Well, James, like I've told you-I'm away because I'm working... Philippa, can you ask Grandma to pick up the phone- Well, we'll just have to hope Grandma's wrong about that won't we? Yes? No. No, we talked about this, James. Mommy's gone. Yeah, why? Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg. One apology's all you're getting, Arthur. Now, where's Nash?  We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago. By now they know we failed. Time to disappear. Buenos Aires. I can lie low there. Maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?  'Course. Send my regards. That's not how I deal with things. What will you do to him? What do you want from us? No, it isn't. I won't do it. Are you giving me a choice? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol. And I choose to leave. You can't fix that. Nobody could. How complex is the idea? No idea's simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind. If I were to do it. If I could do it... how do I know you can deliver?  No, you don't. It can. You just have to go deep enough. I've done it before.  Yes. We're going to need a new architect. You never did like your office. Extradition between France and the U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare. Can you take these back for the kids? I know. I thought you could talk to Marie about bringing them on vacation. Somewhere I could meet- You were married for twenty years. Doesn't she understand that my kids need me? Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never understand- they'd lock me up and throwaway the key. Or worse. Lawyers don't pay for themselves. This is what I have. This is what you taught me. No, you taught me to navigate other people's minds. But after what happened with Mal there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill. I found a way home. A job. For powerful people. If I pull it off, I can get back to my family. But I need help. If you have someone good enough, you have to let them decide for themselves. You know what I'm offering- No, not just money: the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities- things that have never existed, things that couldn't exist in the real world... That's not what you used to say. You told me that in the real world I'd be building attic conversions and gas stations. You said that if I mastered the dream-share I'd have a whole new way of creating and showing people my creations. You told me it would free me. No, you weren't. Your vision was a vision of pure creativity. It's where we took it that was wrong. They won't actually come on the job, they'll just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. Mal won't let me. You want to know what's real, Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting for their dad to come back.  COBB This job-this last job-is how I get there. I wouldn't be standing here if there were any other way. I can get home. But I need an architect who's as good as I was. (smiles Not exactly. A test. Before I describe the job, I have to know you could do it. It's not, strictly speaking, legal. You have two minutes to draw a maze that takes me one minute to solve. Go. Stop. Again. Stop. You'll have to-  More like it. They say we only use a fraction of the true potential of our brains... but they're talking about when we're awake. While we dream, the mind performs wonders. How do you imagine a building? You consciously create each aspect, puzzling over it in stages... But sometimes, when your imagination flies- Exactly. Genuine inspiration. In a dream your mind continuously does that... It creates and perceives a world simultaneously. So well that you don't feel your brain doing the creating. That's why we can short- circuit the process... By taking over the creating part. This is where you come in. You build the world of the dream. We take the subject into that dream, and let him 111 it with his subconscious  While we're in there, We don't want him to realize he's dreaming. Our dreams reel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up we realize things were strange, It does. Every time you dream. Let me ask you a question: You never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you? You just turn up in the middle of what's going on. So... how did we end up at this restaurant? How did we get here? Where are we? Stay calm. We're actually asleep in the workshop. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming, remember? Because it's never just a dream. And a face full of glass hurts like hell, doesn't it? While we're in it, it's real. Someone had to design the dreams.  Let's go another five minutes- When you dream, your mind functions more quickly, so time seems to pass more slowly. Let's see how much trouble you can cause in five minutes. It's good. You've got the cafe, the layout... you forgot the book shop but pretty much everything else is here. They're projections of my subconscious. Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the subject. My subconscious populates your world. That's one way we get at a subject's thoughts-his mind creates the people, so we can literally talk to his subconscious. Architecture. Build a bank vault or a jail, something secure, and the subject's mind will fill it with information he's trying to protect. Exactly.  Yes. It is. Because you're changing things. My subconscious feels that someone else is creating the world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections converge on you. They feel the foreign nature of the dreamer, and attack-like white blood cells fighting an infection. Just you, actually. It's beautiful... but if you keep on changing things... That's why it's called subconscious. I don't control it. Arched stone, iron pillars... it's... I know this bridge. This place is real-  You didn't imagine it, you remembered it... Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.  Use pieces-a streetlamp, phonebooths, a type of brick-not whole areas. Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream. Look, this isn't about me- Leave her alone- Mal, no! She'll need a totem. She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up so fast. And one reality won't be enough for her now. When she comes back, get her building mazes. I've got to talk to Eames. Necessary risk. We don't just need a thief. We need a forger. Rub them against each other all you like, they're not going to breed. Drink? You're spelling hasn't improved. How's your handwriting? Yeah? You wouldn't sell me out.  Not when you hear what I'm selling. Inception. Don't bother telling me it's impossible. That's what I keep saying to Arthur. He's a good point man. You've done it before? You didn't plant it deep enough? That's why I'm here. We want the heir to a major corporation to break up his father's empire. Which is? Let's go see him. Cobol Engineering? Run interference. We'll meet downstairs in half an hour. Last place they'd expect.  Yes?  What brings you to Mombasa, Mr. Saito?  Different tail. What's your problem with Fischer? This isn't the usual corporate espionage, Mr. Saito. This is inception. The seed of the idea we plant will grow in this man's mind. It'll change him. It might even come to define him. Then you need new sources, Mr. Saito. We'll need more than rumor, Mr. Saito. You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf.  Somnacin? As good as the real thing? And to come into the held with us. We need you there to tailor compounds to our particular requirements. Great depth. Three. I've done it before. You just have to add a sedative. Five. There's no room for tourists on these jobs, Mr. Saito. For what? How long do they dream? How long in dream time? After a while...  It becomes the only way you can dream. Let's see what you can do. Everything's fine. I just-I need to test some things. I didn't realize anyone was here. Let me see- You're learning. No. Mal's. This one was hers. She'd spin it in a dream and it would never topple. Just spin and spin... She did. How are the mazes coming? Don't tell me. Remember, you only want the dreamer to know the layout. In case one of us brings in part of our subconscious. You wouldn't want any projections knowing the layout. No.  I didn't say it's getting worse. Look, Ariadne, I need them for this job. I need you for this job. Without your help, I'll never get back to my children. And that's all I can care about right now. They think I killed her. Thank you. Not asking whether I did. The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to the Australian energy conglomerate, Fischer Morrow. ""I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S EMPIRE."" An idea Robert Fischer's conscious mind would never accept. We have to plant it deep in his subconscious. Three levels down. Yes. It is. Now, the subconscious motivates through emotion, not reason, so we have to translate the idea into an emotional concept. That's what we have to figure out. Robert and his father have a tense relationship. Worse, even, than the gossip columns have suggested... No. Positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We yearn for people to be reconciled, for catharsis. We need positive emotional logic. That might work. Inception's not about specificity. When we get inside his head, we're going to have to work with what we find. How do you mean? ""MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE HIM."" Suppress them. We don't bring our own projections into the dream-we let Fischer's subconscious supply the people. I thought he had some knee thing? Surely he flies private? Why? Neater, huh?  Well, now we have ten uninterrupted hours.  COBB  Nice lobby, by the way. Buying us more time in each level. It's basically a week one layer down, six months two layers down- A kick. That feeling of falling which snaps you awake. We use that to jolt ourselves awake once we're done. The trick is to devise a kick for each level, then synchronize them to get a snap that penetrates all three layers. Of course... That we'd grow old together. You shouldn't be in here. This is the only way I can still dream. In my dreams... we're still together. And I shouldn't. No. No. These are moments I regret. Moments I turned into dreams so I could change them. There's only one thing I need you to understand about me... Mine and Mal's. She'd already died. It's James. My boy. He's found something. Maybe a worm. And there's Philippa. I thought about calling out, so they'd turn and smile those incredible smiles... but I'm out of time- Then I panic that I'll always wish I'd seen them turn, that I can't waste this chance... But the moment's passed. And whatever I do, the dream's always the same... When I'm about to call... they run. If I'm going to see their faces again-I've got to get back here in the real world... Because you'll be together. A hotel. We spent our anniversaries in this suite. We can. We will. But I need you to stay here for now- I'll come back. I need you to stay here on your own for now. Just while I do this job. Then we can be together- When's the funeral? Robert'll accompany the body Tuesday at the outside. We have to move. No. I promised Miles. We need one more seat on the plane. If I get on this plane and you haven't taken care of things... when we land I go to jail for the rest of my life. Excuse me? I think this is yours... Same. No problem. Look, I couldn't help noticing your name. You're not related to Maurice Fischer? I'm very sorry for your loss. He was an inspiring figure. Thanks. To Maurice Fischer.  I'll leave you in peace. At least we know he'll be looking for a cab in this. Brace yourselves. Walk away. Come on!- Arthur! Arthur what the- Oh, Christ. Is he dying? We were blocked by a freight train.  Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?! Those weren't regular projections- they'd been trained! So why the hell didn't it?! Don't tell me to calm down-you were meant to check Fischer's background thoroughly. You can't make this kind of mistake-we're not prepared for this kind of violence- This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur!  He's dying! No. No!  It won't wake him up. That person doesn't wake up. Their mind drops into Limbo. There wasn't meant to be any risk. We weren't supposed to be dealing with a load of gunnre. It's the only way you can go three layers deep, Arthur. You don't know anything about that. This was the only way to do this job, Arthur. I did what I had to do to get back to my children. We have a way out. The kick. We just have to push on, do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick. You'll never make it, Eames. Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak. The ten hours of the flight is a week at this level-you'll never make it without getting killed. Downwards is the only way forwards. We have to carry on. And we have to do it fast. Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's get in there and soften him up. No, it won't. Doesn't mean you don't know the combination. You're on. You've got an hour. And Saito was supposed to keep his guts on the inside. You've got an hour-get something we can use. You've got an hour. Get talking. How's he doing? When we get you down to the next level, the pain will be less intense. His conscious mind will drop out of the dream. He'll be trapped in Limbo for a lifetime... When he wakes... his mind could be completely gone. Saito-san, when you wake you might not even remember that we had an arrangement. You'll have forgotten this world. Limbo will be your reality. Lost there so long, you'll have become an old man... Waiting to die alone. Yes. What truth? We were on a job. Exploring dreams within dreams. But we didn't understand how your mind can turn hours into years. How you can get trapped. Trapped so deep that when you wash up on the shore of your subconscious... You can lose track of what's real. Fifty years. We built. We created a whole world for ourselves... It's not so bad at first, being gods. The problem is knowing that it's not real. It became impossible for me to live like that. She accepted it. At some point... ...she'd decided to forget that our world wasn't real. To wake from that. From decades lived. To be old souls thrown back into youth. It was hard. At first Mal seemed okay. But I started to realize something was wrong. Finally she admitted it. This idea she was possessed by. This simple little idea that changed everything... That our world was not real. No matter what I did, no matter what I said, she was convinced that we were still in a dream. That we needed to wake up again... That to get home we'd have to kill ourselves. She... she believed they weren't real. That our real children were waiting. Somewhere above... Calm down, Mal- If it's my dream then why can't I control it? Why can't I stop this? You keep telling me I am- She was certain. But she loved me too much to go without me. So she made a plan... For our anniversary... Mal, come back inside. No, I'm not. This is real-if you jump, you're not going to wake up, you're going to die. Let's go back inside and talk about this, please. I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave our children. What do you mean? Out children are here, Mal. NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T! DON'T DO THIS! DON'T! NO! He letter to the authorities refuted all the claims about her sanity that she knew I'd make... She'd had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists. It was impossible for me to explain the nature of her madness... So I ran. And I've been running ever since, trying to buy my way back to my family... She was sane. She was just lost in the labyrinth. Because we were a family. And we had a life I would do anything to get back to now. But that reality wasn't enough for me then. You don't have to do this for me- We can't stay here. Arthur?! Come to your senses? Let's try instinctively. I have someone standing in your father's office ready to tap in a combination. First six numbers that come into your head. Right now. RIGHT NOW! You'll have to do better. Bag `em. The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis. Shifting Fischer's antipathy from his father onto Browning should work. No. We repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfather's true nature. We bring in Mr. Charles. Arthur, the second we approach Fischer in that hotel, they're gonna mow us down-we run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.  I'll need a decoy. Fine-  I know you've got to stay ahead of them, but drive with kid gloves, okay? The world down there is going to be very unstable- Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again. Rod Green, Marketing.  And you must be... I think you just got blown off... unless her phone number really does have only six digits. Strange way to make friends.  Lifting your wallet, I mean. Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't worry, my guys are on it. I said I was Rod Green from Marketing-but I'm not. My name is Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar to you. I'm in charge of your security here. No. My specialty is subconscious security. Exactly. My job is to protect you... My job is to protect you from any attempt to access your mind through your dreams. You're not safe here. Trust me. They're coming for you. Strange weather, huh? You feel that? Very odd-the weather, the gravity... But I can explain all this. You've actually been trained for this.  Think of the strangeness of the weather, the shifts in gravity. None of this is real...  COBB  We're in a dream. The simplest test of what I'm saying is for you to try and remember anything about the way you arrived in this hotel... okay? Breathe. Remember the training. Accept the fact that we're in a dream. That's why I'm here protecting you. No. I'm a projection of your subconscious. I was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream. I believe that's what has happened. Look at the gun in his hand. These men were sent to abduct you. If I'm going to help you, I need you to be calm. I wouldn't do that-they've probably got you sedated. If you pull that trigger, you might not wake up, you might drop into a lower dream state.  COBB Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you just have to remember it... What do you remember from before this dream? Where were they holding you? Your body's bouncing around in the back of a van right now-that explains the gravity shifts. It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up. It takes years of practice to do it easily. So, you and Browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind. What? That's them extracting a locator. A number from your own subconscious. It can be used any number of ways...  This is a hotel. Room numbers. What was the number you gave them?  Well, we know where to start.  Fifth floor. They work for me. You know what this is? They were going to put you under. Under again. You said you were kidnapped together? You saw them torture him? Your godfather's lying, Robert. It's what I do. He's hiding something. Let's find out what. Let's do to him what he was going to do to you. We'll penetrate his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know. Fischer's. I told him it was Browning's so he'd come with us as part of our team. That's the idea. He'll think that his security is Browning's and fight them to learn the truth about his father. Fischer's subconscious is going to run you down hard. Be back in time for the kick. Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn. You're the dreamer. I need you to draw the security away from the complex. If I know the route... we could be compromised. No. You're with me. Eames, brief Saito on the route into the complex. What we're looking for is going to be in the most heavily fortified section. That north tower. Mr. Fischer, you're going in with Mr. Saito. You have to do this on your own. You have to get in there, break into your godfather's mind and find out the truth about your father. Keep this live at all times. I'll be listening in, covering you. (holds up the sniper rifle) The windows on the upper floors are big enough that I can cover you from that south tower. No, it's music. Dammit. We move fast. Saito, did you copy? Yusuf's about ten seconds from the jump, which gives Arthur about three minutes, which gives us about- The route you gave them, can they do it in under an hour? They need a new route-a direct route. There must be access routes that cut through the maze.  Eames? Did Eames add any features? What did he add? There's no time-what did he add? What about service features? Did he add any large pipes or- Explain it to them. The kick. Yeah, we missed it. Finish the job before the next kick. When the van hits the water. I figure Arthur's got a couple minutes and we've got about twenty. What about the strongroom? Doesn't it have any windows? It's fine. Better hope that we like what Fischer finds in there. Yeah. No, of course not. They're just projections. Buy us some time. You're clear, but hurry-there's an army headed your way... Shit. There's someone else in there. Come on... a little lower... a little- How can you know that? I wouldn't shoot her. It won't do any good- Even if you could revive his body, his mind's trapped down there. It's over. I'm sorry. Saito's not going to last, Eames. And I can find her. She'll have Fischer. She wants me to come after him. She wants me back down there with her. It was. And this is where she'll be. We both did. We built for years. Then, when that got stale, we started in on the memories. This is our neighborhood. No. Our neighborhood.  That was our first apartment... then we moved to that building... we got that small house when Mal became pregnant. We had time. The house Mal grew up in. No. Come on- We both wanted a house, but we both loved skyscrapers. In the real world we had to choose. Not here. We need some kind of kick. I'll improvise. There's something you have to understand about me. About inception. You see, an idea is like a virus... Resilient...  Highly contagious, and an idea can grow. The smallest seed of an idea can grow to define or destroy your world... I know what's real. I know what's real.  I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I have to get back to them. Because you left them. You left us. Our real children are waiting for me up above. They're not real, Mal. Our real children are waiting for us- I know it- Guilt. I feel guilt. And however confused I might get.  COBB However lost I might seem... it's always there. Telling me something. Reminding me of the truth. That you were wrong to doubt our world. That the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie... Because it was my lie. Because I performed inception on my own wife, then reaped the bitter rewards... We'd become lost in here. Living in a world of infinite possibilities. A world where we were gods. I realized we needed to escape, but she'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world... I couldn't make Mal understand that we needed to break free. To die. So I started to search our world... Searching for the right place in her mind... And when I found that place, that secret place where she had shut away her knowledge years before, I broke it open... I broke into the deepest recess of her mind, to give her the simplest little idea. A truth that she had once known, but had chosen to forget... That her world was not real. That death was a necessary escape. You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter... I never thought that the idea I'd planted would grow in her mind like a cancer. That even after we woke... You'd continue to believe that your world was not real... I was trying to save you-I'm sorry. If I stay, can she take him back? Go check he's alive, Ariadne. Send Fischer, I have to stay- I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That means he's here. I have to stay here and find him. I can't stay here to be with her because she's not real. I wish you were. But I couldn't make you real. I'm not capable of imagining you in all your complexity and... perfection. As you really were. You're the best I can do. And you're not real. What're you doing? No! That's the kick-you have to go! No, I'm not. I'm staying here to find Saito.  And to say goodbye. I will. I know. But we can't. And I'm sorry. And we did... I miss you more than I can bear... but we had our time together. And now I have to let go... Someone from your half-remembered dream...? Filled with regret? I came back for you... I came to remind you of what you once knew... That this world is not real. Yes. And to take a leap of faith. Come back and we'll be young men together again."
nine,GUIDO ,Daniel Day-Lewis," You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive. Finally, a serious question. Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini... How do you begin? How do you begin this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page 1... Page nothing... Buongiorno, Dante. Bene, grazie, bene. We all have questions for Signor Contini. Is he going to follow us? On my desk. Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so.  Get me a cigarette. Jaconelli -  Ascolta me.  p. 6  Careful what you say. He's a spy from the bank. I need a cigarette. I need a coffee and a cigarette. Actually and an aspirin. That's right: that's directing. And it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference, finally, what the answer is... Yes. p. 8 Yes, yes.  Soon. No. Yes. No. Nobody. Dante.    And his spy.  Why is there no fire escape in here? What if somebody needed to escape? I can't face these reporters. I have nothing to say. What the hell's wrong with me? I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't write. I can't breathe. My heart is racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you flowers, I know. I'll come to the cemetery at the weekend. You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I could visit you every week. Don't look at me like that.  I miss you. Thanks for coming, everybody. Yes. Actually, it's my shortest title yet. Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles. Why? I still don't know what my last film was about. Of course I can tell you what my film is about...I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything... but... I... won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press. It sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to see it. Stephanie. I'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it. For good? I told Luisa that when we got married I would never again make love to my leading lady. I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE. You want me to be serious? In a Press Conference? I WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE I thought I was the clown in this circus. I WOULD LIKE TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE I KNOW THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS. Flops. AND IT'S A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY BODY'S NEARING FIFTY AS MY MIND IS NEARING TEN. Excuse me? I CAN HARDLY STAY UP AND I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP, AND I DON'T WANT TO WAKE TOMORROW MORNING, AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME HEAP BUT WHY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY? AFTER ALL, THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE HERE - ONLY ME I WANT TO BE YOUNG. AND I WANT TO BE OLD. I WOULD LIKE TO BE WISE BEFORE MY TIME AND YET BE FOOLISH AND BRASH AND BOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, ""GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, WE'LL ARRANGE IT."" THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT. p. 16 What would you like to see that I haven't already shown you? I AM LUSTING FOR MORE, SHOULD I SETTLE FOR LESS? I ASK YOU, WHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR IF NOT FOR TAKING IT TO EXCESS? ONE LIMITATION I DEARLY REGRET: THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME I'VE EVER MET. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER ME TO TRAVEL ALONG WITH MYSELF. I WOULD EVEN LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SING A DUET WITH MYSELF. I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE  TO BE THERE , EVERYWHERE  EVERYWHERE, THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS I WANT TO BE HERE  HERE HERE GUIDO GUIDO GUIDO. ME  ME! I WANT TO BE PROUST... p. 17 ...OR THE MARQUIS DE SADE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHRIST, MOHAMMED, BUDDHA BUT NOT HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD. AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART - IT'S THE END IF SOMETHING IMPORTANT DOESN'T START... ...I WANT TO BE YOUNG, BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD. WHAT I WANT IS A TALE OF SOUND AND FURY THAT SOME IDIOT WENT AND TOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, ""GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S RIDICULOUS, WE'LL ARRANGE IT..."" SO ARRANGE IT! THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT! p. 18 I need a room. A suite. With a view of the sea. A balcony. Something with air. I've come from Milano. On business.    I'm a businessman. Busy busy busy.  Please. Why not. Not the flops.  I need to see a doctor. Do you know one who's discreet...? I'd like to see him today, in my room, now, if possible.  And I need to place a call.   To my wife. Luisa, tesoro... Is everybody mad at me? I had to escape from the Press Conference. Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa. No, but this time I'm really sick.      I can't breathe. p. 21 Yes, of course I'm by myself. Yes, please come, that's why I'm calling, please come straight away. That would be wonderful. Great. Marvellous. I don't know, some spa.   Horrible.   I just kept driving.  And, actually, it's hardly worth it. I'll be home in a day or two. But I do wish you were here. I love you.  This number - if a woman answers you put it through to my room, otherwise... What? What is she whispering? Is it my blood pressure? Is it serious? Am I dying?  Pronto. p. 24  It's a very an important call, Doctor. I'm sorry, I have to take it. Private call. What? Yes, yes. It's about my film. It's from the Vatican. Go ahead, Monsignore! Yes, yes, of course, I'm listening.  Carla! Carlissima. Of course. Very happy.  Carla, all those bags for the weekend? Carla... I have to tell you... they found out who I am at the hotel-- ... yes, horrible, but obviously we don't want to be followed by the press, so I found the most charming pensione for you, and it's right here. It's charming. Close the curtains, it's too light in here. Perfect.   Now, go into the corridor--- Shhh! Yes, count to ten and come back in, and pretend you're in the wrong room, and I'm a complete stranger-- I'm here on business. Go, go.   Wait. Your face. Get your makeup.  Don't move, Carla.  Uh-huh.  Good for him. Why not? Beautiful. When you come in I want you to be my little savage.  Go, go. Hurry, please, Carla. I'll pretend to be asleep. Could you do such a thing? What happened? Come here. What? Carla, just come here.  Be savage. Show me. Yes, you have. And I don't have the faintest idea who you are. Page one, page one, page one... The figure emerges from the darkness like a goddess. She is Claudia, his muse... She takes the man's face and kisses him... ...And with that gesture, he's suddenly inspired to write something... profound. Mother of God, give me a sign. Excuse me, father... His Excellency, the Cardinal, is he -? I would very much like to speak to the Cardinal. Do you think he might grant me - No.  I'm in need of some guidance, some pointers... For His Excellency? I'm sure that would be possible... I'm not going to ask how you found me. Oh God. Really?    You understand? You're not going to drag me back? Thank you, my old friend.  Where are we going?  Ciao.  No, I remember you. You were, we all enjoyed you, so to speak.  No no no no - impossibile - are you telling me she didn't get the script?  Pierpaolo! Claudia didn't get the script! Send her another one. For Chrissake. Send her two! Cretino! (back to Lombardo, listens) Yes, yes, that's what I say, people just don't realise - she's an actress as well as a star - I know Dante's dying to talk to you. A dolpo. Ciao. Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap! What are we doing here? What? No. Oh please God. No. I spoke with her yesterday. She didn't even mention it. Give me a cigarette. What's that? For which scene? Looks like the Folies Bergere. It's wrong. Italian women don't wear those things. p. 37 Why did people love that film? I'm trying to find it. Ashtray. Thanks. You were saying - my head is jammed up my ass. Me too. Do you believe in God? So do I. Oh yes, very much so. Not as much as I would like to be, not as much as you would like me to be, I'm sure, but certainly yes, I'm trying. Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your Eminence, I am not happy. I'm searching for something. I feel a sense of misery, of despair and --  Excuse me - my films are what I imagine.  How do you train the imagination? I can't breathe, I can't breathe.  If I die it would kill your husband? I have to go to work. Carla, I can't breathe. It's impossible. Because it's impossible. Please. For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. It's not fair to my wife. p. 48 No. Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast, a man and a woman, a woman and a man... (pours himself a glass of wine) Something light and hectic - like Mozart would do it, like Figaro.  Like the circus... Let's try to dig for something else. Maybe a group of people digging, with shovels, in the desert. Luisa! I can't believe you came. The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit. I was dying, until just now.    Come. And don't think I forgot your birthday. When you get home, the house will be full of flowers... I hope not. Happy Birthday, my darling. p. 50 Let's drink a toast to Luisa's birthday. Happy Birthday.  Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling, this is Don Mario. This is my wife, Luisa. Luisa was in that film. It's true.   It was your first part. Your name, it's Italian. What have you done before? Waited? For this? Thank you. Thank you. For what I'm looking at.  Keep running. Luisa! Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened? What lie? There are plenty of restaurants. p. 56 Well you certainly managed to. I didn't know she was here.   She just turned up. The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me. Carla, you have to wait outside. I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues.  I'll find someone to escort you home. Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station. Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she would be staying in the hotel, wouldn't she? Think about it. I didn't even know you were coming. Because it's true. It is. Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as I know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin.  What? What are you laughing about? It's finished. It's finished.  If it wasn't before, it is now. Vodka. Yes, I remember very well, Stephanina from Vogue.  Amazing. May I take a cigarette?  Please. Prego.  Really? And what truth is that? I don't think religion is dead. And what exactly is the sexual revolution?  Style.  Okay. I hate that man. No. I love you Luisa. Can we please try to be close again. Pronto... Is the doctor still with her?  I'm here. Thank you.    I'm going to stay with her now. Grazie. Carla, I should call your husband. What have you done to yourself?    I'm not worth dying for, Carla. Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk about everything in the morning... Rest, rest.   Cara mia... Hold on to me, Mamma.   Don't let me wake from this. Yes. Of course. I'm sorry.  She loves you, you know that, don't you. Darling?  Where's Luisa?  I can't. I need help. I'm not cured. I need more time.  Okay. Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up.  I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, about the script. Everything... Otherwise I won't be able to start, I won't know what I'm thinking... Are you there? Luisa? I'm not asking you to let me come home, I just want you to come to the screen test tonight. Not for me, but for the movie. You always have, you always do. Could you turn to the right please, Claudia. And can you turn to the left. Now just one slow turn for us. Bellissima.   Brava.   Cut. That's fair.  That's fair. I'll be back. p. 75 I'll be right back. You look ravishing. It's good to see you. Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script? Talk to the people who love you in our films, they're not interested in my script! They're interested in the way you turn your head, the way the camera looks past you to the moon... the way you smile a little as you cry, the way you really do blush for the camera - how?! -  who even knows, but whatever else it is, it's not my script. Not a million - you're the muses, the incredible women who made Italy what it is today, a country run by men - who are themselves run by women, whether they know it or not.  The great women...  p. 77 In a way - yes - you have this man in the story and he's, he wants to take hold of everything, to devour everything, he can't let anything go, or, he doesn't want to, and he changes direction every day, because he's lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to death... Exactly!   They fall in love with him. What? No, you misunderstand... p. 78 She's his inspiration. I fall in love with you every time. No. There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about... ...and, all through the night, I wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened. I don't know. I don't know. Sure. It meant so much to us all.    That you came.  p. 83  What did you think? Did you like anybody or -?  Luisa?  What for?  What are you talking about? The screen test? You have to understand, it's nothing, this is what I do, I direct. That's my job. What have I done? What have I done, Luisa? I CAN'T   MAKE THIS MOVIE, THERE'S   NO WAY THAT I'LL BEGIN IT. I CAN'T   BEAR TO SEE THE CAMERAS ROLL. PROBLEM   IS THE SUBJECT, THERE'S   NO PLEASANT WAY TO TREAT IT.  p. 86 THE PROBLEM IS THE AUTHOR'S LOST CONTROL. HOW I WISH IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE SO, BUT WE CUT THE LOSSES-STARTING NOW STRIKE THE SET AND KEEP IT FOR SOME SIDESHOW. TELL THE CAST AND CREW THAT THEY CAN ALL GO. FIND ANOTHER GENIUS, I CAN'T BE ONE OR BECOME ONE. I CAN'T EVEN TELL HOW I'D BEGIN. HELP LUISA, HELP ME, HELP ME MAMMA, HELP ME SOMEONE. HERE'S A PLACE WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN. GUIDO OUT IN SPACE WITH NO DIRECTION, GUIDO AT A LOSS FOR WHAT TO SAY, GUIDO WITH NO INTERVENING ACTORS, GUIDO AT THE MERCY OF DETRACTORS, GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT... NOTHING HOLDS TOGETHER NOTHING MAKES A BIT OF SENSE NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP OR UNDERSTAND HOW CAN I GO ON TO WATCH THE WHOLE OF MY EXISTENCE END UP BEING NOTHING THAT I PLANNED HAVE I LOST MYSELF AND ALL I WISHED FOR HAS MY LIFE BECOME A MINDLESS GAME GUIDO, I CAN'T STAND THE NAME OF GUIDO GUIDO, FOR GODSAKE, WHO IS THIS GUIDO? GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT GUIDO...  I destroyed everything, Mamma... ...I destroyed everything, I just... you make one wrong turn and then because of that, after it all the turns are wrong. And you are so far from where you wanted to be...and you're lost and then you're lost. p. 87 Old friends, I have to come clean with you. There is no movie. I can't pretend anymore. We have to stop.  I'm sorry. She seemed so happy. I didn't want to interfere... Is she with anybody? I like to get about without everybody pointing at me. Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk. No, no. Nobody. Don't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is - I just miss her. I should have IDIOT tattooed on my forehead.  Does she? Did she really say that? No. Never. I've spent this time trying to learn something, Lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up. p. 90  The only movie I could make now would be... I don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife. I can't remember how you do this. I don't want to say too much. The first way that we kill our film is by talking about it. But this scene is about reconciliation. And within the scene I would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other.  Maybe it's the most important building block that we have to begin again... We start from the beginning each time and I feel today as if I'm starting from the beginning. We'll just keep asking each other questions, and don't look to me for the answers, okay? Yes. ACTION."
assassins,RATH ,Sylvester Stallone," Just a little ways.  Up to those trees. Sure. Why not? It's possible. I hope not. It's a common question. A dime. Average. Taken. Everyone who plays the game knows the rules. Don't know.  That's how it works. Right. What are you thinking about? And an R.C. Go ahead. Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not. Some. Can I ask you a question? Why didn't you fade? Yeah. Yeah. No. Yes.  Please come in. I prefer it like this. I prefer it, that's all. Would you like a drink? Why are you working today? You're very good at this aren't you? I know what you expect, but I don't want... I called because I just want... I need to talk. I've been thinking about my life, about things I have done... What I do for a living is in some ways similiar to what you do. I know that everything has a price.  I want you to understand that I'm willing to pay. Honesty. I just want to ask you some questions. Do you ever regret things you've done? But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them? Do you think about their wives or their families? Do you ever think about starting over? Can you tell me about it? And what if you never meet that man? Do you believe that? Yes. Thank you. Fuck you, Nick. I don't give a fuck -- Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts -- You fucking should be -- Shit.  Just do them all.  All of them.  Shit. Shit.  What are you doing, old man? You're too fucking slow. Okay.  Which one?  Which one is yours? Amateur. Your move. Son of a bitch. I'm not done yet. This is 1242.  I got it. No.  No problem.  The airport, right? How'd you cut yourself? You a waiter?  You look like a waiter. Where? What restaurant? So you're from around here? Where you from? Not too good at small talk, eh? I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself. Since you looked like a waiter, I had to ask what restaurant because of what happened at the Trattoria Roma. Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma. Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad. But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably. I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair. What? You're right.  Talking too much again. What?  You think I'm running you up? Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out. The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out! We're both going to the airport. Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on. Okay, don't. If either of us fucks around, the other can blow the fuel line. What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai. How long have you been freelance? It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds. You're wearing a wig now. We both know what you were doing. Tachlinkov. After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland. We go around once. Okay. There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good. I know you're going to jump. You're still young.  Young enough to still think you're indestructible. Invincible.  You believe with utter certainty you can bail out at the last second and survive. If you do survive, we'll see each other again. I bet you fucking know! I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone! I'm being set up.  Fucking set up! Is this how it went, Nick? A joke?  A joke? You think this is a fucking joke? A player? Sorry.  My mistake. Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them? One vegetarian plate and a can of tuna fish.  Room 1014. Don't be stupid and you will live. Hurry. Turn here. How many bodies were there? He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there? One hour per man. Get on the expressway. Nowhere yet. Nikita?  She helped me find you. Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right. I work for the government. Yeah. I'm part of the game, just like you. Twenty large?  That's all? The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars. Slow down. I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more. Now you understand why I'm here. I really think you should slow down. Turn off the engine. No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead. Oh shit. Dammit. Want a drink? Okay... I'm not good at this sort of thing, but we don't have a lot of time, so I'll just go ahead and get started. First:  you.  I ask myself, 'What is she thinking?' Simple.  She's scared.  She's almost been killed twice and now she is alone in a room with a man that she believes is an... assassin. Furthermore she was brought here not entirely on her own accord which only increases her fear and suspicion.  Thus, as long as she is afraid, her first, maybe her only thought will be escape.  Does that leave me any other option? No. The gun is silenced.  She could shoot me right now. She could take the car and be far from here before the maid comes in the morning, but -- You're the computer hacker, you tell me. Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many. 'Them'? Until a minute ago. If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me. Another contractor. No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one. He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him. Because he is trying to retire me. Yes. The nature of the business.  You remove your competition. Yes. We don't have a choice. Right. It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money. If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead. This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money. If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you. Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you. No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you. Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them. He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him. Rath.  Robert Rath. Just Electra? As in daughter of Agamemnon? What do you want to know? No. Because I'm done. Do you play? It's not the same, is it? I had an opponent. He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game. We played with a code using The New York Times obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won. He was... taken. I killed him. Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top. Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing. The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency. More or less. They recruited me when I was in high school. Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages. Some people said that.  I never thought so. I was just different. No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program. No, they didn't. Of course.  I was going to be James Bond. They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel -- Women?  No... not really. Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women. Because you are a women. The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you. Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared. The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets. My first take? Why? It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline. No.  Just the first one. They become complicated... messy. Did it ever bother James Bond? This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you! You get a job swinging a hammer, the first day you get a blister, it tears open, it bleeds and it stays sore a long time.  You keep swinging the hammer, you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again. Check. Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless... It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine. I don't. The kind preferred by drug smugglers, arms dealers and politicians. Do you have a passport? Good. Mexico. Thinking. Nothing. I don't know. Yes.  Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.  No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.  No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.  Take us there. That's where he'll be. I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think. No. It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think. Work.  The things I need to get done. Yes. No. No. I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been. You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me. Here? Yes. I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping. Breakfast. Okay. He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on. You should knock. How was the beach? Taiwan. Thank you. You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it. I'm going to shower.  If you're hungry, go ahead and order some dinner. I'm going to call. Sit down. Okay -- Transmits and receives. I paid a lot for these. It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these. This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank. He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank. No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front. You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside. Then, we wait. It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe. The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank. He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun. He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines. That's right. If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me. I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car. Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine. I've been thinking about it for a long time. What? I told you, he will. I was. Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting -- Yes. I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it. It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense. Yes. I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me. He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island. What did he say? He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game. Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business. No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited. Yes.  Here I am again. No. Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids. Why did you trade a bishop for a knight? They're worth less points. I didn't notice them. How do you know they're not? What? Jesus, if someone had -- Why in the hell would you take that chance? Thank you. No. It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels. Why? And you were drilling these holes...? Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you. Did he explain how this happened? What are you doing? That's a ridiculous move. Because, I'll take it. I'm sure you will. Yes. Yes. Why?  I don't know. Both. I didn't want to complicate the situation. It can be. Yes. Someone like me, like you.  A pro. She was taken. No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't. After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated. I'm not sure that I care anymore. No. Honestly? When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me. Why? I'm not normal. Martin. All right.  I'm in the bank.  He'll move now.  How are you doing? Good. Yes.  Could you check on a transfer for me? Rath.  Robert Rath. Good.  Now I'll need to close this account.  I'd like you to ready the paperwork. That's correct. American currency. I have all day. Now, we wait. I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives? Thank you. Four minutes. I waited another four minutes. Wait until he is on the stairs. I'm taking off my mike. Electra -- Last night -- Yes. I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know. It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say. It's irony.  That's what it is.  But the real irony is that you won't know it's irony until you're sitting over here. When you walked in here and you saw me, sitting here, waiting; the first thing that went through your head was that you were a dead man. You're thinking that you've been sold out.  That's the only way I could know you were out there.  Why would you think this?  Because you don't trust your contractor.  You don't trust anyone.  It's automatic. It's the first and last commandment. It's the only thing that keeps you alive.  So, try as I might to tell you the truth, you can't believe me. Do you see the irony of the situation?  It's kind of funny, isn't it? Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now. Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me. All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes. You're a businessman, right?  This is a business deal.  Behind that counter, I have over ten million dollars.  I'll give you half of it, more money than you'll make in the next ten years if, you walk away. That's right. Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it? You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right? What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say. You would be. Why don't you tell me. Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you. Electra? Electra? Electra, get out. He's coming, Electra!  Get out now! Electra, listen!  You have got to come to the bank for the money!  The money! Electra! Electra! Electra, what's happening?  What are you -- Electra. Bain! Shit! Electra! Electra! Down!  Get down! Electra! The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid of it!  Throw it! Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Game over."
klute,BREE ,Jane Fonda," Strangle him to death funny? Bree Daniel, any messages?  OK, thanks. Trina? Bree. Do I? Oh no, just a commercial I thought I might get, that's all.  Well I'd take a quick thirty, hon. Do you have a commuter for me? Wait. Hullo. Ooh, I knew I'd like you. Lover, that's got to be a little extra. I mean it sounds very exciting, what you speak of, you've got me all excited. But something special like that, you know it's got to cost a little more, mm? Oh lover, oh it's too much -- oh you thrill me -- yes, like that, it's -- oh it's beautiful, oh --  What is it? What about? You said that. Who?  Gee. Why? Honest?  Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun? You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator? And you just want to ask me a few questions? -- and I take acting classes with Lee Tainter -- -- and I was in two of his workshop type productions, Uncle Vanya and the girl in Five Characters --  -- here -- and then of course I have the modeling and the demonstrator work, the trade-fair work -- but naturally I feel ready for something more, well you know, sustain --  Thank you very much. Oh hon, I just don't know. I'm trying to stay out of it. Well try to get someone else Marty and if I change my mind -- sure hon, bye.  Marta -- Hi. Bree.  Hi. Well I could come over tonight - if you'd like -- if there's no one else.  I really want to just talk to you. Hi? -_ Oh -- You scared me, Mr. Faber. Oh thank you.  It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk? Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful. And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly -- And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been -- -- May I? It's so -- Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you. And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling -- And next day at the beach -- our beach pavilion -- I saw him again, his eyes burning into me. I was helpless. Without his even speaking to me, without his even touching, I knew that somehow -- somehow -- Whyn't you just cut out? Oh you bastard. Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.  If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard! Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes. Look, I told the police everything: I don't even remember the schlub! They showed me that one. I understand it's Grunemann, but I told them, I just don't remember.  A family sort of man. Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all. Look -- please -- will you just try to get it from my side? A year ago. I was in the life fulltime. I was living on Park with leather furniture and a million dresses. Then they dropped on me, the fuzz, they caged me -- they started asking me about a man, some man, I'm supposed to have seen a year before that. Two years ago, two. He could be in Yemen! A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville -- All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.  OK Tommy-baby, Allie-Allie-in-free kid, I got the gumdrops. You remind me of my uncle. Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he -- I can't say he was anybody! So -- OK -- that's all? Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and-- Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --  Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with -- Bree Daniel.  Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted?  Oh, well, thank you very much but maybe the next time you're in town?  Well I just love Ted and I'd love to meet you -- you have a very nice voice -- but I just --  Well I'm having a chat with a very nice cop. Actually not a real cop; he's a private inves -- Most of them. How would I remember?  You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.  Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that. You saw that, goddamn you? You saw it? He's seventy. His wife's dead. He started cutting garments at fourteen. His whole life, he's maybe had a week's vacation, I'm all he has and he never, never touches me, and what harm in it, what -- Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or -- -- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things -- -- you perverted hypocrite square bastards. Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.  Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up. What? This?  I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild. Gee. I've had men pay two hundred dollars for me -- here, you're turning down a freebie.  You can get a perfectly good dishwasher for that. You've changed your mind? You do want to play?  I go on rounds. You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around. And they're always polite -- show people -- they say thank you very much. You lie there covered with blood, smiling, they say -- Well do you think it was him? Can't you get him?  You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it. He never told me. What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each. Frank -- Klute. Frank, he knows you're a pimp. He knows you were my pimp. Yeah Frank, I know that. Did you like my friend Frankie? Didn't he tell you what you wanted? About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?  Well -- she's dead. I thought you were going back to the apartment. Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?  Is there anything more I could -- What're you gonna do next? What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me? You said it was! Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.  Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little? -- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness? Goodbye. What the hell do you mean, pathetic? It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof. Oh, don't be a doo-doo.  Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out? So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby -- Look, if you don't use it somebody else just will. And you've done your whole bit with me, your entire duty, and so now this is my thing. So enjoy, Mr. Faber would say, enjoy. Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to -- Who the hell are you, buttoning me up? I knew it, I knew it, a killer. Oh lover -- oh you thrill me -- oh, it's beautiful -- oh yes, yes -- oh like that, like that, yes -- What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger. Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John. And I'm sorry I can't stay and learn your special little games. And I certainly don't want you to feel bad about this -- losing your virtue all of a sudden -- because I sort of knew you would. As I said, like everyone, right? Besides - you can always tell yourself you made me come downstairs. Ta, luv. -- Why? Why -- please, why? -- Why lose, why look? Why hate and give and want and love? Why get, grieve, g -- -- gug -- gug -- Why? -- I want to know what. When? Arlyn Page. Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time. Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her. I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds? Joanie -- Mike, hi --  Hi Pat. A new daddy. I'n he cute? Trina this is Klute. I told you about him. Uh uh.  Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.  She was with you after she left Frank. Gil?  What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.  -- Then you don't need me. You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars. Arlyn? Honey?  Look, it's all right. Arlyn, it's all right. Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about. Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper -- Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns? Did he come around often? Well hello -- come on in. How?  Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?  Why? What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.  I don't get you. I told you before, you wouldn't understand. No. Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!  You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out! If I asked you something, would you not laugh? -- asked you to look at something?  I thought it was maybe changing shape or something. Look -- I hate everybody; and I'm sorry for everybody; and I'm scared all the time. Look, I don't know either. It's like the only thing I know how to do -- I feel safe. Please. No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right. OK ----- OK I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed? Oh! I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you. No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I -- Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good. Oh -- The son of a bitch seduced me! I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something? Guess!  I do not love him. All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.  Do you always have to repeat? Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up. The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.  I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or -- (then more rapidly, plunging) So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know? I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you? Is that all you have to say? Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore. Spangler says we have a relationship. You and I -- a relationship.  Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. You suppose he's a married fella? He got in my clothing! Oh. Oh. Oh look what he did in them.  My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start. Right back at the start, right? You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right? Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?  Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff. With Trina. Maybe I wasn't there when you called.  How do you know how bad it was? Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that! Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --  Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it? So do I.  Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide. You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that. Why isn't he locked up? Is that why Klute didn't tell me? What was better? I made better bait? Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't -- I don't have to look at anything. I don't have -- Oh no. Grunemann? I've looked at him a -- Oh! --  Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it. Look, too much is going on here. I'm moving in with another girl, that's all. Just for a while. No! -- until he gets back.  Yes I heard you, I understand that. I said I'm going to come over, I'll wait until he gets back. No. Look -- could I use your phone? Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone. Is Mr. Faber there?  Mr. Faber Senior.  -- I'm -- I just have to talk to someone. I'm just a little way across town -- What?  I have an appointment with Mr. Faber. I have an appointment with Mr. Faber. I'm sorry -- Mr. Faber Senior. It wasn't important. Did Mr. Faber leave a message for me or anything? Mr. Faber Senior? Bree Daniel. Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet? Well if he does, I'm at --  -- two seven eight, three one hundred, and I guess I can wait here five minutes; then I'll try from somewhere else.  Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows who. Mr. Faber, I just wanted to leave this for your father, and I wondered if you'd -- Someone -- Yes -- all right -- -- Yes. Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call. Yes. Will you let me go then?  If you'll let me go I could tell them what -- I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes. I said yes, I see. Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me. Hi. Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy. You're going back? Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away? You wanted to, or you are? You could at least look at me! Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic? Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out! How can you not think so? You know the things I can do. What? Please, I'm a city person. I'm sure it's just as good as here but I'm a city person, that's all, I am!  Hell I know what it's like. I was in Jersey once: the frogs go bra-a p all night!  What'im I supposed to do? Mend your socks and sing in the church choir?  Do you not believe I love you? I'm honestly, honestly just -- Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.  You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side? Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me? Hey. Oh heck --  Oh heck -- I haven't decided yet!  I haven't decided yet!  I haven't decided yet! --"
moonstruck,LORETTA ,Cher," What d'you know about coffee? Gimme a loaf of bread. If you're such an artistic genius, why can't you keep track of your receipts? How am I going to do your income tax? If you're an artistic genius, how come you got butter on your tie? Give it here. I'll give you this, Al, you make good coffee. The man who sends those spends a lot of money on something that ends up in the garbage can. Without me, you'd be out of business. I like flowers. You don't want the fish. It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride. Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.  That will give you a base. For your stomach. You eat that oily fish, you go up in the air, halfway to Sicily you'll be green and your hands will be sweating. She was too young for him. Fine, Bobo. We'll take the check. You never have dessert. What's the matter? I shouldn't. What? Bobo, take the cart away.  Are you proposing marriage to me? You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck. We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage. Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down? Yes, on the floor. I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.  Where's the ring? You could use your pinky ring. You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement. Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony Cammareri. I will marry you. I will be your wife. What time is it? So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time. What about the wedding? How near is she to death? Then let's set the date. How about a month from today? Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set. A month from today? I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up. Call me when you get in. You've made me very happy, Johnny. Who is he? You have a brother? Sure. Yeah.  My fianc. I don't believe in curses. Right. The key's in it. Night. A split of Moet. You, too. Hello, boys and girls. Guess what happened to me? Where's Ma? You're not sleepy? Pop, I got news. Here.  Ti amo. (Translated: I love you.) You look tired. I'm getting married. Yeah. The guy died. He got hit by a bus. Johnny Cammareri. He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying. In a month. You've got to come. You've got to give me away. And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had. I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino. Yeah. Here. It's temporary. So you'll come to the wedding, right? No. Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception. Pop. Father of the bride pays. It's his duty as a father to pay for my wedding, Ma ... No. Pop don't like Johnny. I got married before, you didn't sell. I'm thirty-seven years old. Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there. I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny. Hello? Yea, this is Loretta Castorini - yeah. Is that you Johnny? How was your plane ride? Have you told her we're getting married? Just don't wait until she's dead. Not yet. Alright. I'll call him. Today. Listen, Johnny. Call me after you tell your mother. Alright? Alright. And don't stand directly under the sun. You've got your hat, use your hat. Alright. Bye-bye. She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth. Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card? Is Ronny there? I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come. He's in Palermo. Let me come and talk to you. Is Ronny Cammareri here? I would like to speak to him. Yes. I'm going to marry him. Yes. Do you want... Excuse me. I don't understand. I didn't come here to upset you. Maybe I should come back another time. That's the bad blood between you and Johnny? But that wasn't Johnny's fault. Where you live? Come on. You ready for the coffee? I'm making you a steak. I know that. I do what I want. You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood. Loretta. He knew my husband who died. Bus hit him. Instantaneous. Yesterday. Why what?  So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then? Stupid. Seven years ago. Just Johnny. No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky. What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear? You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey? You think so? You really are stupid, you know that. I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't. (she pours them both another drink) She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf! The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away. (She grabs his wooden hand) So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again! I'm telling you your life! No! Because I have no Luck! I am looking where I should to become a bride! A wolf without a foot! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I have no Luck! Where are you taking me? Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed. Me neither. I was dead, too. All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny. I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me. Get all of me. Take everything. You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry! What's that? That light. Oh. I've never seen a moon like that. Oh my God. What? What have we done?  This time I was trying to do everything right. I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again. I'm marrying your brother! You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo? You don't get along with anybody! What did I do? That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life! Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him! Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins! Why not? Snap out of it! Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding. I'm telling you you can't. But that's cause he don't know! What? What are you talking about? Alright. Alright. Where's the Met? Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession. Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident. I... a... slept with my fianc's brother. I know. I know. Alright. Hi. I don't wanna talk about it. Thanks. What's the matter with you? What! How do you know? Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old. I won't be home for dinner. Hi.  What's the matter with him?  What about the moon?  No. Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go. I got things to do. Right. I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita. Bye, Aunt Rita. Yeah, I'll be in. I want you to get rid of the grey. Ma! Grandpa! No? Okay. Hi. I thought I'd try it.  You look good. I said I'd go to the opera with you. Nothing else. Who painted that? Kinda gaudy. For what? So. Where are we sitting? They get some turnout for this stuff. I like parts of it, but I don't really get it. That was just so... awful! Beautiful. Sad. She died! I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick... I know. She was coughing her brains out. And still, she had to sing all the time... Pop? Pop? What are you doing here? Mona? I got it done. What are you doing here? You're married. You're my father. I don't know whether I saw you or not. That wasn't my mother. No thanks. I wanna go home. It's really cold. My mother guessed that my father was seeing somebody and I told her she was crazy. She looked like a real piece of cheap goods. But who am I to talk? How can you ask me that? You are guilty. I'm guilty. I know what I know. He didn't come! You're late! This is your place. This is where we're going! The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever. I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me? I'm really afraid. I'm afraid of who I am. And you're not now? Why not? Let me go home. Let me go home. I'm freezing to death. Well. I don't really know where to start. Everything's different. No. Are you drunk? Where's pop? What? He's in Sicily! He's with his dying mother! WHAT!! She was dying! A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more! Ronny! He's coming. You've gotta get outta here.  Ronny, please... It's Johnny. I'll get it. No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him? I love you Pop. Hi. Hi. Why ain't you at the store? You? No. The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT! I'm getting palpitations! Johnny. I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying. I can't. I need my family around me now. Johnny, I have something to tell you. I have no secrets from my family. WHAT? What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged. I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me! And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here! Here! Take your stupid pinky ring. (she throws it at Johnny) Who needs it? The engagement's off. In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress. What! Where's the ring? Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri! Yeah, Ma, I love him awful. Wait a minute! Wait a minute!"
insomnia,WILL ,Al Pacino," I don't need to look at it. Tell that to her, partner. ""Halibut fishing capital of the world."" My partner... You did your homework, Officer.  How you doing, Charlie? Just after Leland Street. Seven years. You have, Chief. Nice kid. Keeping you busy up here, Charlie? So far. Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft. They're all over everybody. That's I.A.'s pit bull. Detective... Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality. What about these contusions? Any signs of rape? Wait. He washed her hair. Combed it. Cleaned under her fingernails.  Clipped them. Toes, too.  You found nothing on the body? No fibers, skin flakes, hairs... He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks. Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart. There should be a reservation for us. I'm always all business. Is it really 9:30? Come on in. What do you want to talk about? We'll talk when we get back to Seattle. You know my plan of action. That's right. He's asking everybody questions. He's just rattling your cage. We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that. Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that? One word to I.A. and he walks. No way. Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions. I care. You got to be kidding me. Think I'll pass. What kind of calls you get around here? Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap. It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature. Aren't you going to write that down? Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night? No diary. What time was that? Who was the last one to see her alive? These are designer.  Expensive.  Could Randy Stetz afford these? Well her mother didn't buy them for her. Kay Connell had an admirer. I want to talk to the boyfriend. You don't seem all that sad. Did you love her? Kay Connell.  Did you love her? ""She was nice.""  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back? You heard me that time. But she was seeing someone else on the side. Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about? What kind of stuff? The other guy? After that she left the party to go to him. Ran like hell to go to him... Now you listen to me, you little shit. This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt crap may work with your mamma, but it doesn't work with me.  You got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else.  You want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is? You don't know. Just a little. I want you to check this out, Ellie. Do it again. The small things - remember?  The second you're about to dismiss something - look at it again. Who's that? Good.  He's up next.  Halibut Calabrese.  Halibut Olympia. Halibut Cajun Style.  Halibut fish and chips... Can't wait to see what's for dessert. Looks like the natives are restless. Don't do this, Hap...  Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing... You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not... I'll just have another Scotch in my room.  If you don't mind. Where is it? We're sure it's hers? Biology and Algebra. Find out who she studied with. Make-up. Find out where she bought it. Lab.  Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset. Who here reads this kind of crap? Read them.  Tell me anything that strikes you. Lab. That's it. No. We put it back where we found it. You said it was a fishing cabin. This murder was in the papers, right? Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions. Fill this with random books.  Make it look heavy. It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he overlooked a detail.  I told her to come. That's him. Fan out. Stay here, Ellie. Go!  Go!  Go! Police! Goddammit! You!  Head back up to base...  You!  Go right and follow along the water...  Hap!  You go left... Go! Where is he?  Where'd the shot come from? Freeze! Hap! Hap! And then I lost him.  In the fog. Twenty, thirty seconds.  I followed the sound down to the water.  That's where... That's where I found Hap.  Why didn't I know about that goddamn tunnel, Charlie? I had him, Charlie.  Right in front of me.  Not two feet.  I could smell the son- of-a-bitch.  Playing with me.  And I missed the shot.  He was right there and I missed the shot!  Then my goddamned gun jammed... I had him! I'm going to check on the roadblocks... You were nice to him.  He liked you.  Dormer.  That's not exactly how I'd put it.  What do you mean, ""Funny?""  You know why everyone hates you, Warfield?  It's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one yourself.  Well I got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because I'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of.  You just remember that when you're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner! Next time.  Go ahead and lie. Goddammit! Goddamned...thing! Hap! It's good to be accurate, Ellie.  You're doing your job. I was here. I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time. I'm not. How's the book? Thanks. He would have liked that. That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell. Anything.  It's important. No.  No.  Don't be sorry.  It's not your fault. How's the leg? Right.  Got lost in the rocks. ...Anything catches your eye, you put it in a bag.  Anything looks strange, you put it in a bag... ...Anything he may have dropped, moved, kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag. Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper clips, coins, buttons - nine times out of ten a suspect leaves something behind... The woods.  One group heading south, the other heading north. Anything? Alright.  Go back and set up some follow- ups for this afternoon. He had to have exited here.  Over those boulders.  I saw him move, he's nimble. Would have taken the hardest way out. Thanks. Habit. Fred Duggar? I'm not expecting anyone. What did he look like? I need to borrow something. I could say the same thing about you. Who's playing? She your only sibling? No.  Well.  I had a brother.  He died when I was eleven. It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico. Not really.  I remember I was more embarrassed that he had died.  Embarrassed that it made me different.  So I didn't tell the other kids at school what had happened.  They'd ask me where he was, where he'd gone.  And I'd make up stories.  He was visiting an aunt up north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a Swiss boarding school.  Stuff like that.  Nice kid, huh?  Just kept making up more and more lies... I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.  Officer!... I'll pick it up.  You head back to the station.  Duggar - I'm at the coroner's now.  I'll be back in about twenty minutes... I thought it was better if I came.  Under the circumstances. Thanks, Doc. So where's the other bullets? What's with all the moose antlers around here? When's Rich coming? First I need a copy of the key.  Dormer. Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna check up on me every...  What?  Who is this?  I said, who is this?  Now you listen to me... Right. Then change it. I don't remember. Listen, Ellie.  I don't have time for this shit.  Five feet, seven feet, twenty feet.  Put down whatever you want in your report, alright? These should have gone out two hours ago. You go ahead.  I'll be there in a second. Why don't I give her a ride? Good to see you, too, Randy. You're not missing much. You were good friends with Kay Connell, weren't you? Best friend? That's a long time. Must be tough for you.  What happened. What about Kay's other friends? You want me to take you somewhere? How about this.  You like this? Thought you wanted something fun... You and Kay were like sisters? Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau? Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on your ass at her funeral? You like games, little girl?  Well how about this one - you're standing right where her naked body was found wrapped up in a garbage bag. Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz? Who gave her those dresses? I need a name. You don't know. But you were such good friends... What was? Who? Who? What was it? Lucy.  Desi. Goddammit! What? Good. No. That's right. So? I don't think it'll lead anywhere. Well.  If he's local.  Give him a call. I'm fine. Walter Byrd. You think this is a nice meeting we're having here?  Friendly?  Two people getting acquainted?  You sick, coward, fuck.  I get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down.  Beating a seventeen year- old girl to death.  Washing her afterwards, cleaning her.  Make you feel like a real man?  Huh? I outta end this right now.  Take a rock and smash your fucking skull in... That was an accident!  You hear me?  I didn't know it was him!  I didn't know it was him! What's your game, Byrd? The phone call.  The knapsack. Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are partners on nothing.  You're going to get a phone call. I said you're going to get a phone call. Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books. You're going to be brought in for questioning.  Yes down at the station. What do you mean, ""wild card?"" What do you mean ""wild card?"" I have a cold. Back to the Lodge. I trust you. Duggar called him? Not really. No.  But it sounds like something I would've said. See you tomorrow, Ellie.  Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch... Goddammit, Byrd! I didn't know! Fuck! What is it? I'm fine. No. The light.  It keeps coming in... There was this guy named Weston Dobbs. Twenty-four.  Worked as a part-time stock boy in a copy store.  Every morning he'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year-old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street.  And every afternoon he'd watch the boy get dropped off again.  He did this for about six months.  Until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came. Kept him in his apartment for three days. Tortured him.  Raped him.  Made him do things... When he was done, he got a rope and a kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the basement of the apartment building.  But he didn't do a good enough job.  The little boy's neck didn't break and he died from shock.  The landlord found him five days later. Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment. We took some blood samples from the boy's body and planted them in his apartment.  Arrested him the next day. There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything. We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal. Do you think it was wrong?  What we did? What was the nature of your relationship? She was an attractive girl.  Did you have sex with her? But she was an attractive girl. Did you have sex with her? But you wanted to. You gave her gifts. Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace. Doesn't sound like a mentor to me. What about him? That's an understatement. I like it fine. They haven't been easy. It's legitimate. The case is closed, Ellie.  I got the next round. What the hell are you doing calling me at the station? Randy Stetz is in jail. Congratulations. The tape. There's nothing more to talk about. We do nothing well together.  Nothing!  You understand me? What the hell do you know? I told you that was an accident! Don't you pull that shit with me. Couldn't get it up, Walter? Like this? This an accident, Walter? It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to death.  Ten minutes. Get the fuck out of town, Byrd.  Leave and never come back. Six-thirty. I have to get back. Had a lot of help from Nightmute's finest. No. I'm here to end this. No back-up. Procedure went out the window a long time ago. That's where you're wrong, Walter. There is no secret.  Because the biggest difference between you and me is what we will or will not live with...  Walter? Walter! Drop the gun, Walter. Another J. Brody mystery. God, you're a pain in the ass. You, too. Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house. Byrd's dead. Yes. No.  But I covered it up.  I lied. Because I just couldn't be wrong.  Don't ever get that way, Ellie.  Don't ever lose your way.  It blurs the line.  Just let me sleep, Ellie... Let me sleep. What about your shoulder?"
dragonslayer,GALEN ,Peter MacNicol," Vide, Magister. There's something wrong. What's the matter? What's happened? To me? Of course. Well, almost.  The first two chapters. To tell the truth, I haven't dared try it. What's the point, anyway? I hate books. I hate drill. I want a real task. I don't hear anything. Voices, singing on the road. I don't see anything. Here are your sticks. You're in a morbid frame of mind. What's all this about dying? You don't even look sick. Master, don't you think -- Look at yourself. How far will you get like that? A league, two leagues?  Why don't you wave your hands around and summon up a coach-and-four? You pilgrims: You're used to lotteries. Why not draw straws to see who'll be first to carry ironshanks here. Send me. You're always saying I need seasoning. I need a test. Let me go. I'm ready for anything. Not this one, was it? Hodge -- what are you doing? Stand back! Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva celet! I guess... Me too... What's the matter, Hodge, pack too heavy? Here. Too cold, is it? Too warm? I've got as much respect for the master as anyone, old man. But -- then again, I'm master now. Easy now. We mean no harm. We've been looking for you.  More the other way around, I'd say. A few words, that's all. You were looking for a conjurer. Right. Requiscat in pace.  Ecce: magister novus! My lord Ulrich is no longer. All that you asked of him, you may now expect of me. The dangers he would face, I will now conquer. The task he would undertake I will now fulfill. I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I am the Sorcerer you seek.  What's the matter with him? What have you got there? A little gold, eh? What do you say I change it into lead? I'm no fraud. Hodge, nobody forced you to come along. Well, if he told you I needed wetnursing, why don't you just turn yourself around and go back home. You're too far behind us. Come on out. Not a good idea to get separated. Let's go. By the gods! I'm not going to say anything.  Take it easy. I knew the moment I saw you. I've known the whole time. Don't worry. No one's going to find out. Just tell me: why? The lottery! Daughters are chosen, but sons are not! What do you mean?  No! No! Hodge! I hear you. I know.  What are you doing with this, Hodge? Hodge, don't die. Listen to me. You're not going to die. Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!  Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam! The whole kingdom like this? Where? I see it. Let's have a look. Are there other entrances?  No smoke. How do you know it's in there? Now, great mountain, hear my command: Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum draconis! Evanescat latibulum draconis! You're talking about superstition, friend. None of that has anything to do with what I, Galen, have already achieved. People of Urland! Send a messenger to the king. Vermithrax is dead. Crushed by the power of the moon and the stars! Laid low by ancient wisdom. Dropped into the Abyss by mystical practice. Nihil plus mysterium! Looks like you've been up to a little sorcery yourself. Or is it witchcraft? What's the matter? A real woman never stops talking.  What sort of gratitude? A knife in the belly? An arrow in the back? Don't worry. I'll be back. One of the best things about the water here in Urland is that there's so much of it -- look at that! Mmm. Good. But not cold enough. Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from his Majesty. I cover the goblet, so... remove, so... and behold: winter in a mug! All right. How many of you have ever seen a table fly? Wait, it'll rise now. Yes. Please -- no payment. I have always found magical practice to be its own reward. I seek only some yet greater challenge. I was invited. What failure? What's the matter with you people? You want the dragon back? Yes, of course. Dead.  Cubiculum gravis aperat! Open up, dammit! Fenestra gravis aperat! Asser gravis aperat! Divinitus! How do you do. I see. And only a few had to be sacrificed. Depends on who does the dying. Virgin? If you say so.  Nothing. Maybe. I'm sorry. I heard a rumor. Families with money, that sort of thing. Wait -- how long do I have to stay in here? Greil -- help! It's me. Are you hurt? I can't. I can't do it. I just can't. I'm no sorcerer. Whatever power I might have had, it's gone. I know: I'm an imposter. A fraud. A fake. I'm sorry... Smith -- have you ever forged a weapon? These are your sharpest? It's sharp -- but it's not sharp enough. For what I'm going to do with it. Valerian, this isn't just for your sake. I'll need the amulet. I know. We've met. I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at least give me a weapon. Don't bother. That's not the kind of fire we need. Nunc, per Potestatem Hermeticum -- ex flammis, ferrum sangrinarium! Well done, Simon. Thank you. I understand. Thank you. Hatchlings. They'll have to be killed too. Anything else?  Yes. Who is? What do you mean? And you'll be eligible because -- I am in love. But not with the Princess. Be gone! I've got plenty of reasons to kill you that have nothing to do with this sacrifice. Run! Get out of here! No! Stop! What are you doing? Elspeth! Still alive. Nothing. I was just thinking -- poor Hodge. Hurts. That thing was small, but its teeth were sharp. But the big one's alive. Somewhere down in that burning lake. You old trickster! The burning water! The lake of fire! He had it planned. He knew this was going to happen. We've got to go back, I want to talk to him! He couldn't walk -- he knew he couldn't make the journey. So he had us make the journey for him! Don't you see?  What? Why? No you're not, this is my job. Absolutely not. Stay close. Never mind. Come on. All right. Wait here. Ex favilla, vita nova! Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can see you! Over here! Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I thank the powers that made me! Food? Wait, I have something to tell you. No it can't. Listen: I thought I was a sorcerer -- but I wasn't. I thought I had power -- but I didn't. I thought I was you -- but I'm not. Anything! No! I can't. Not if it means killing him. No! You can't! No. I'm fine. Yes. That too. Yes? A horse. No. It must have been wandering loose. Or wild. You don't want to wish it gone, do you?"
below,ODELL ,Matthew Davis,"  Gunner's mates standing by below, sir. You can tell that?  From here? 'Fraid not, sir.  Though I can recite the submariner's motto in Latin. Think they see us?  Morphine...penicillin...ether...this looks like, uh.... Pharmacist Mate is best you get on a submarine... ...but he missed the boat.  I'm Odell, supply officer.  They gave me the job 'cuz I have keys to this stuff.  Here.... What happened to your ship? So this ""Fort James"".... Just a whale. 200 feet or so, on our way to 250. (off her ashen look) Still gets to me, too -- the sounds down here. See if you can't cut those clothes off. Get a better look at his wounds. Officers' shower just forward.  We try to hold it down to 30 seconds, but [in your case].... Not that I heard of, ma'am.  Sorry.  You said they fired one torpedo?  Just give me one.... Well, you got a slow-sinking ship -- slow enough to get at least a few lifeboats off.  But this U-boat only fires one torpedo the whole time.  That's not textbook German tactics.  They keep firing until the target is sunk. Why didn't they use their deck guns? My third. Just wondering if their story doesn't seem a little...""off."" Sure.  Right there.  Five-degree gradient at 2-1-0 feet. Colder water...deflects sound waves...just in case they start to -- Have no idea, sir.  I just ran in and it was already -- My idea, sir.  She's a certified med-tech, which may be the nearest thing to a doctor we've --  Keep working!  Please!  Fish in the barrel, sir! I think that's right. Kingsley? Not sure.  May've stepped out. Me?  I've talked to her twice. Wai', wai', wait.  Chief.  Wasn't there a maintenance bulletin on Mark-14s? Something about self-starting? Got to come this way, ma'am. Let them sort it out.... Be all right, really, just.... Almost three percent.  Chief says we need to vent before long. Well, just.... I can't believe it's one of our own hands doing this.  Seven weeks, I think I know most the guys now.  Just don't believe it's one of them. Aye-aye. Say again? Shut up, Stumbo.  Just shut your stupid mouth. Okay, it's over, it's over.... We use the diesels above, batteries below -- and the batteries off-gas hydrogen.  As for ""how long""... Guess we're gonna find out. How're those stitches holdin', Zap?  Good? Okay, matches, Zippos, c'mon, give 'em up, Chief wants 'em under lock and key....  Be right back to change those bandages, Meyers.... What's this one called? Wallace, you givin' everybody nightmares again? Well, stow it.  And gimme that Zippo, Hoag.  So what is it?  Identify. Lieutenant Brice!  What are your orders? Aye-aye. Find the leak and fix it.  That's right. Chief thinks with the tower flooded, that gives us enough weight to stay down even when there's air in the main. Hey, you up to it or not? ""Found it.""  [Should we] head back? So the night we lost Old Man Winters... It's an odd place.  How did he bang his head?  'Fore he went over? I heard that the boat hit something -- but I never felt anything down below. Why didn't you tell us? Okay.  But I still don't understand how he hit his head. Gimme the light, gimme the light, gimme the light.... Get him down.... Help me get him down.  ""The barn?""  Our ""barn?"" Sir, southern ports of England couldn't be more than two days away.  Mr. Kingsley here is a navigational officer -- he should know the area and -- Mr. Brice, we've lost both periscopes and our main sonar -- we're blind and nearly deaf down here.  The men are in a bad way, and two of our senior officers are now -- So exactly how far from England are we? No. Zero-nine-five. Just in case this boat can't make it home. For whatever reason. 'Tenant?  A word? Now, Mr. Loomis. ...now maybe it's just a coincidence...I know Coors wasn't too sure about his fix to begin with...but it sure seems like we're going right back to where we sunk the German ship.  Where we lost Winters. Just asking the question. That's so stupid I can't even -- It's warm. Loomis?  'Smatter? Clear out.  Now.  Batteries are still arcing.  C'mon, Claire -- we could be next. Somethin'...somethin' kicked off the hydrogen and...and they're all...they're all.... Try again.  One, two, three. What the hell is wrong here?  If we could blow the main, get to the surface...but I don't know how to fix this friggin' stuff....  Keep trying, huh?  All I know is what Coors told me...that Winters wanted to shoot the German survivors, shoot them right there in the water.  Brice, Loomis, Coors -- they wanted to help.  Apparently Winters lost the argument. And I'm just repeating. Mr. Brice? Lieutenant?  Just, uh, reporting that we haven't been able to repair the electrical.  Heating's down, too.  Ballast levers are inoperable, probably jammed during the depth-charging, Stumbo's working on it now.  We show 90 pounds of compressed air left in the 600- pound system, and I'm wondering if we should save that for when we try and surface -- or use it now to breathe. Sir?  Sir, do you have any idea why this boat seems to be going back to where the skipper died? Stumbo, CO2 hangs low -- it's working its way from the floor up.  Gotta stay on your feet. Stumbo.  I need you to keep workin' on the ballast controls.  We need them to surface, okay? Hey, hey, maybe there's some kinda... pulley or wench, or....  Isn't there a come-along in the forward room?  Can't we use that? So tell me why.  Tell me why these three officers would kill their skipper and conspire to cover it up.  That's what you're thinking, isn't it? Loomis was up for a major citation, okay? Brice was in line for his own command, Annapolis, naval family...Coors had this Irish girl up in Boston, they were talkin' about....  These guys had everything to live for, Claire. ""Why.""  I haven't head ""why."" Wallace?  Wallace, sound off. Wallace? Look, running out of plays in the playbook.  If you have any ideas on how to get control of this boat.... Wallace?  We're running out of air. And if you had to guess what would satisfy our ""malediction"".... Okay, okay, I'm gonna take care of it right now. Just bleed a little air into the control room, just enough to -- I don't know how much we need.  But we'll die down here if we don't do something soon.  And you'll be the first, Claire.  Keep watch.  If she gets any worse, find me. Claire?  What're you doing in here? Are you telling me...that the German submarine Kingsley saw.... But it was an accident. And you think that Winters would actually just....  Or do you think that he wanted to pick up survivors...and that maybe it was... Let's use that air! Keep cranking, keep cranking! No.  No, no, no.... It's working. All right.  Okay.  We do this fast. Stumbo, see if we can drain the tower.  If we can't get out that way, we use the forward trunk.  Wallace, see about raising the radio mast for a distress call. Lemme see, lemme see.... Wallace, raise the mast, issue a radio challenge on the RAL-6.  Get that ship to i.d. itself before.... We have a contact.  And maybe an opportunity. To abandon ship. I think it's better to scuttle and take our chances with a surface vessel, any surface vessel, rather than -- Mr. Wallace.  No matter what Mr. Brice says, I want you to go to the radio shack and establish voice contact with that -- And neither are you, sir! Stumpie, Wallace, with me. Know how these work? Try. Again, Stumbo!  Again! They saw.  British freighter.  They saw and they acknowledged. So what would you say?  If you were the one who had to go back and explain it all? Have you considered it?  That maybe when Winters died, he just died?  Period?  And the rest of it...I mean, the kind of air we were breathing...does things to your brain."
coraline,CORALINE ,Dakota Fanning," Hello?...   Who's there? You scared me to death, you mangy thing! I'm just looking for an old well. Know it? Not talking, huh? Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me... the well!nan And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by MICHIGAN? And if I'm a ""water witch"", What do you mean? I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline. Coraline. Coraline Jones. I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne. Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were- you-born. Ehh!! I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom. I would have died. Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening. But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here? Wasn't my fault you hit that truck. That sounds exciting.  Huh... a little me? That's weird. Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls. Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad? D'you know where the garden tools are? Humph, it's just raining. So? Ewww! Ahh!! One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting ... four incredibly boring windows ... and no... more... doors... All right, little me, where are you hiding? Huh? Hey Mom... Where does this door go? I think it's locked. Pleeeeeeeeease! Bricks? I don't get it. You're kidding? And why is the door so small? You didn't lock it. Why don't you ever cook, Mom? Looks more like slime to me. Think they're trying to poison me? Don't forget about me, guys. Okay? Good-night...little me. Whoa... Huh? MMMMM, something smells good. Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night? You're not my mother. My mother doesn't have b-b-buh... Hello? My father can't play piano. I, uh  sorry  but she said to tell you the food's ready. Mmmm, this chicken is good.  D'you have any gravy?  I'm real thirsty. Mango milk shake? Home? For me? I didn't know I had an Other Mother. Really? What rain? Huh, what about the mud? I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get home to my other mother.  But ... Wow. Hello. Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls? I can't wait till summer. You're both comin', right? Oh, the mud... It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother. You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers. Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats. Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky... Ohh, Poo-eeeee! H-hello?... I think our mail got mixed up.    Should I leave it outside or... Hmmm... Huh? Meeshkas? Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones. Cor-a-line.  Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot. No!!! The...jumping mice? The one behind the wall paper? But... it's all bricked up. Still Coraline, Miss Spink. Read what? A what? What do you see? Well, what should I do? No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though.  Danger? Great, the village stalker. What d'ya mean, ""we?"" Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss! So... that doll. Did you make it look like me?  C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat? I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either. Ew! Dangerous? So? Well, what do you think? Wait a minute! Hi. Cheddar?... Oh, the mice bait... You mean my Other Father? Mmmmmm! I love your garden! Well, she says it's time for dinner ... breakfast ... food? I can't believe you did this! Mmmm...so good! Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong. My friend? Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were- you-born. Hello? So he can't talk at all? Hmm, I like it. You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything. Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she... Whoa... cool! Look at you! It's wonderful, Wybie! Wow! Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great! We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so-- A-mazing! Ughhh. Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse circus, not pretend like the crazy man's in our house. Da-ad! I'm not five anymore. But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these. My other mother would get them. So what do you think's in the other apartment? Then why'd you lock the door? They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here. With those stupid uniforms?   Right. Are you kidding me? Gross-gusting. Oh, like the gloves? That's what you always say. Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that talks too much. You must be the Other Cat. Um... I can see you don't have button eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can you talk? Cats don't talk at home. Nope. Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I called you that, I really am. How'd you get here? What do you mean? She's amazing! That's nonsense. He can't talk. Hey, Wybie.  Oh my God. Ahhh!!! Yeah!! Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat  Spink and Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and... it was, it was magic.  Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie. Really? What's that? I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW! I'm really, really tired. Yeah...  I just need to sleep on things.  Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so much already-- I'm going home tonight, robots - and I won't be back. Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! Go to sleep, go to sleep... Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... Mom!... Dad!.. Oh God, I'm still here? Hey you! Where's the Other Mother?     I want to go home. If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna find the Other Wybie. He'll help me. Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing. Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the old well be here? But why? Why does she want me? Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters! Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it? Small world. Stop, he's one of the circus mice! Gooooood kitty. I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go. You aren't my mother. No. Ow, what are you doing! Ow, that hurts! Who are you? Why are you all here? Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance. Has she taken those, too? I ... I'll try. Did she do this to you? I hope that feels bet-- Let's go! Come on. She'll hurt you again! Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real Dad ... Real Mom! Oh, Mom's groceries! I missed you guys so much-- You'll never-- Oh... the Wybie that talks... It used to look like this pioneer girl; then Huck Finn junior; then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons, and braids, and.... Grandma's missing sister! I think I just met her. C'mon! She's in there. Not in a million years. But it wouldn't matter; she can't escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can. Great! I'd love to get rid of it! Where are you hiding, you little monster?! The doll's her spy! It's how she watches you, finds out what's wrong with your life! NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this whole world where everything's better - the food, the garden, the--  --neighbors. But it's all a trap! Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat! You're not LISTENING TO ME! You creep! Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave me the doll! Mom!   Dad! Pick it up, Dad, pick it up. Dad!   Whe- Where have you gone? Uh... don't you only make wings for the ... dead ones? How is hundred-year-old candy going to What's it for? Good-night, Mom. Good-night, Dad. Hello. How did you get in? Do you know where Mom and Dad are? How did this happen? She's taken them. They're not coming back, are they  Mom and Dad. Not on their own. Only one thing to do. I have to go back. They are my parents. Hmmm, okay. Mom? Where are my parents? They weren't bored of me.   You stole them!  Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you?  Be strong, Coraline.  Why don't we play ... a game? I know you like them. My real parents. And, and the eyes of the ghost children. If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me.  And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes. Then you let me go. You let everyone go my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here. Not till you give me a clue. And for my parents? ...it's a deal-- What does she mean ""wonders?"" Hmmm. No!! Stop!! Why steal this? Wow... That must be it. Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it! Oh, Wybie... I'm Coraline. Uh-huh. You don't get it, do you? Of course you don't understand. You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B. Ahhh! No!! Noooo! I think you might have said something like that. Thank you. I'm heading inside. I still have to find my parents. Come on, quickly! No, I ... I brought a friend. You, you have a very funny way of showing it. Hold on. We aren't finished yet, are we? I already know where you've hidden them. They're behind that door. Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all right. No ... I'm ... Mom! Dad! I missed you so much! I didn't break it. It must've broke when you escaped. You're talking about... your garden catalog? But look at the snow on your clothes...? So, gonna order the tulips? For the garden party!! Dad! So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the invitations. Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's just...eccentric. Oh, hello again. You still mad? I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the Other Mother?  it was all I could think of. I think it's time, don't you? To set them free? Well, I'm glad it's finally over! What about...me? But how?   I locked the door!? I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s- somewhere she can never ... Outta my way! Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl, I think you are so nice ... ... I give you bowls of porridge And I give you bowls of ice cream. I give you lots of kisses, And I give you lots of hugs ... ... But I never give you sandwiches With grease and worms and mung beans. Why did you change your mind? The sweet ghost girl. Just bring her by the house tomorrow.      We can tell her together. You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me. Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible. Actually, it's just lemonade. How's Angus doing? Cold drinks? Thanks, mom. How are the meeshkas, Mr. B? Welcome, Ms. Lovat! I'm Coraline Jones -- I've got so much to tell you!"
election,JIM ,Matthew Broderick," Morning, Lowell Twenty-one... twenty-two. Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy? Yes, I do. Well, good luck there, Tracy It's hard to remember how the whole thing started, the whole election mess. What I do remember is that I loved my job. I was a teacher, an educator, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else. The students knew it wasn't just a job for me. C'mon, wolverines!  Defense!  Let's hold 'em back! I got involved. And I cared. And I think I made a difference. I knew I touched the students' lives during their difficult young adult years, and I took that responsibility seriously. In the twelve years I taught U.S. History, Civics and current Events at Millard, I was voted Teacher of the Year three times - a school record. Standing in front of a room full of young people, trying to make them think that's how I wanted to spend the rest of my life, So would this be an ethical situation or a moral situation? What's the difference between ethics and morals, anyway? Anybody Derek You're on the right track,  who can help him out? Michelle? Or a life experience.  Good.  And ethics? Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?  Tracy. Tracy Flick.  Tracy Flick.  I've never met anyone quite like Tracy Flick. She first showed up in my life as a freshman delegate in student council. I'd seen a lot of ambitious students come and go over the years, but I could tell right away Tracy Flick was different. It wasn't long before everyone knew who Tracy Flick was.  She made sure of that. Her drive was astonishing.  Even scary. Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed. Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know. A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny. Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that. Dave came to Millard the year after I did, and we hit it off right away. We backed each other up in teachers' meetings and shared an interest in 60's music and micro-breweries. You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy. Our wives became best friends too. And when Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was born, they asked us to be godparents. You did it at your house?  Your own house? In love? But you haven't written your novel. Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.  That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral. I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals. I guess I don't have to tell you how all this turned out. sits on the vinyl sofa. After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce. He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him. Okay.  We'll pick up here next time Hey, that's super You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.  Right Looks good to me. NO, that's fine Okay, fine. Sure You bet. Should be easy.  So far no competition. Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy Sure Good luck, Tracy. I don't blame Tracy for what happened with Dave. How could I? Dave was an adult more than twice her age. Sure, she got on my nerves once in a while, but I admired Tracy. I really did. Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication. Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.  Paul. Paul, could I talk to you for a minute? Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident. I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do. But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports. Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell? Student... council... president. Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right. Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied. Paul, what's your favorite fruit? takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard. Okay, let's say Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy. Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back. Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time. He likes it. Diane really wanted to have kids -- and so did I -- but it seemed like there was always a reason to wait: she had to finish nursing school, I had to get my masters, we needed a new house, we needed more money.  Finally we just decided to go for it... ...but for over a year we hadn't had any luck.  And Diane was getting desperate. Yeah, uh, just a minute Yeah, just -- Sure. Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house. Here? Okay.  Give me the drill. I'd always liked Sherry, but we'd never had a chance to spend any time alone together.  How with Dave out of the picture, I began to see what an incredibly sensitive and giving person she was. Plus she had finally dropped all that weight from her pregnancy, and really she looked great. We got to be pretty good buddies.  I even took her to the mall one time while her car was in the shop. You look great Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little. So what do you think?  Should we get a room? points at the motel. Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.  Yeah. No. I mean, you know. Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes. So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life. ... that is, until things started going all haywire with that damn election. Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down. As far as I know, they-- Anyone who gets signatures in on time can run.  And she got in just under the wire.  Nothing I can do.  Looks like Tim Kobza. Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine. Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, Jerry is running unopposed for Vice President. So we'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running. The first in alphabetical order is Tracy Flick. The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzier.  Paul? Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for President - another one of the Metzier clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier. Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about. I think that's a little strong Walt. Ron? There's your culprit Shall we give it a name? No, I... uh, didn't know that  Still clear? We'll let it run awhile Right now? Three twenty-five. What had blossomed between Sherry and me was too real, too powerful to deny. For the first time in years, I felt free and alive! So as you can imagine, my thoughts weren't on the election that Monday morning. My thoughts were only on Sherry, on how perfect she felt inside. There was a special poem I wanted to read to her later, at the motel, as she lay next to me. Close, close the lovers keep. They stay together in their sleep. Close as two pages in a book That read each other in the dark.. Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period. What's the problem?  Oh yeah, you bet. is inside. Tracy. Come on in. And shut the door behind you. I guess you know why you're here A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it. Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend? 6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down? Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we ""interrogate?"" You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself. This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand. I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections. Okay, Tracy.  Have it your way. Just wait outside. Tammy. Possibly.  Please just wait outside. Tracy, don't go away.  Come in, Tammy. So... what do you have to tell me?  What is it. Tammy? Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word. And when did you do it? Exactly when? And how did you get in the school? Which door? I don't believe you. Final  I don't know what your problem is, but if that's the way you want it, that's the way it'll be.  I don't have time.  You're out of the election, and I'm turning you over to Dr. Hendricks. Tracy? Looks like today's your lucky day You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed. That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in? The rest of the day was unbearable.  I kept smelling Sherry on my clothes and on my fingers and I just couldn't wait to get out of there. I wanted everything to be perfect that afternoon, so I decided to give myself a little time to prepare during eighth period. Pop quiz, everybody No whining.  If you've done your reading, this is an easy one. I'd have exactly forty-eight minutes to make all the arrangements. If you finish early, just sit quietly and check your work.  I'll be right back. Okay, everybody, pass them forward. Stephanie, put down your pen. I'll see you all on Wednesday. And don't forget to vote tomorrow. Sherry I Sherry I It's Jim! Sherry Oww! Fuck! Jesus fuck! By any chance, has a woman shown up in the last half-hour or so?  Maybe she was looking for me. Are you sure? Sherry, it's me.  Are you there? Pick up.  Okay, it's 4:32.  I came by at 3:25 like we said and waited, but you weren't there.  Anyway, I hope you're okay -- I'm worried about you. So now I'm just at the...  at the place we talked about. Suite 219.  So I'm here.  Everything's all set.  You can just come over.  Can't wait. Okay.  Bye.  Okay As I walked out of my home that evening, unsure if I'd ever return, my entire life in question, I somehow discovered within myself a place of perfect peace.   Oddly, in my solitude I felt more than ever a sense of communion with every human being - past, present and future.  Because no matter what we tell ourselves, no matter what illusions of friendship and family we create, each of us is always and forever profoundly alone. Sherry never came home that night.  I know, because I spent the entire night in her driveway. I had no choice but to go home. I needed to shower, get fresh clothes, explain what I could to Diane.  But what was I going to say?  That our marriage had become a charade?  That making love with Sherry had given me a vision of a better life? Then again, maybe I could slip in and out without waking her up. Cupcakes.  Jesus Christ.  Cupcakes? My life was crumbling, and I was expected to care about these ungrateful kids and their pathetic little dreams.  As if my only purpose in life were to serve them.  Mr. McAllister.  Mr. McAllister. Somebody tore down my posters. It's not fair.  It's not fair. Can I have an A? Can I have a recommendation?  Can I? Can I? Well, fuck them.  Didn't I have my own life?  Didn't I have my own dreams? Cupcakes  Oh, yeah. Big day. Are you there?  Sherry, are you there? It's Jim.  Why did you do that?  I trusted you. Completely.  You've ruined my life. Do you know that?  Do you realize that? Huh?  Do you?  You've ruined Diane's life.  You ruined my life.  is that what you wanted?  I'm sorry.  It's just... I'm going nuts here.  Okay, all right, so... Really, I'm sorry.  I just think we should talk, okay?  I love you. If only my own life could be corrected so easily, with nice fat black lines drawn neatly through my sins. What?  Right.  So let's start counting. Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back. Right.  I know. I'm fine.  It's just a bee sting, a simple little everyday bee sting. Some people, they get stung, it's no big deal.  Me, I swell up.  Okay? I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know. All right.  I'll be back You're there. Sherry... I love you. It's the only true thing I know anymore. A mistake?  That was no mistake. Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --  What d'you got? You're kidding, right? Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won. Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count. I was at the end of my count when it happened.  I'd come up with exactly the same numbers as Larry:  Tracy had won the election by a single vote, 256 to 257.  I was about to announce my tally when... The sight of Tracy at that moment affected me in a way I can't fully explain.  Part of it was that she was spying, but mostly it was her face. Looking at her, you might think she was a sweet, innocent teenage girl. But she wasn't sweet.  And she wasn't innocent. She was selfish and cynical and ambitious and thought nothing of destroying the lives of others to get to the top. who knew how high she would climb in life, how many people would suffer because of her? I had to stop her now. Larry? I think we've got a problem. Mostly Tammy fans He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more. It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.  Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing - If we could get started.  People! Once the winners are announced, we can all go home, okay? Some contests are so well fought that is seems unfair for someone to win and someone to lose.  I think that's the case with all the candidates you see before you today.  All of them are highly qualified and embody the, uh, the integrity we expect from our school leadership. That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president. Let me add that this was an extraordinarily close race. It's my pleasure to announce the next president of Millard High School. Paul Metzier! And now, for vice-president. Could I get a...?  JIM McAllister. Paul doesn't need any of my help. He's going places.  You should be very proud. Just a bee sting. Thanks, I'll be fine. Oh, she's not a bad girl.  She'll come around. Good school. Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home. You bet. Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home. Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine. Diane, I... I don't know how Diane and I made it through that night, but we did.  Our marriage had gone right to the brink, but in the end I guess it was saved by one simple fact: we truly loved each other.  So we made a commitment to begin the painful process of piecing our lives back together.  The worst was over; the mistakes of the past were behind us. The next day held the promise of a new beginning. After all, what harm had really been done? No one was dead. Hi, Linda. Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience. Hmm? Oh.  Okay. You rang? After Paul got the bad news, Walt asked for a few minutes alone with me. It was very simple, really. I offered my resignation, and he accepted. Very quietly, it was all over for JIM McAllister at Millard High - twelve years of hard work down the drain. Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer. Thanks. Well. I'm going home now. I don't remember driving home, or much of anything that happened in the next few days. There were news stories in the paper and on television, former students calling with their support, endless hours of doing nothing, thinking nothing. Diane stood by me through the entire humiliating ordeal, in a way, it sort of evened things out between us. Soon school was over, and summer stretched out in front of me as it always had. Funny how the rhythm of the school year remains ingrained in you for life. in mid-June we found out Diane was pregnant. After two months of sitting on my ass and two months helping out at my brother-in-law's travel agency... ...I landed a position at a Saturn dealership. I never thought I'd end up selling cars, but it's not so bad. I like the Saturn philosophy -- it really is a different kind of company. I'm just relieved to have a steady income now that there are three of us. Actually, it wasn't so difficult making the transition from teaching to selling. It's like I tell my customers: my role is just to educate people so they can make informed decisions. When I send someone home with a new unit, I feel a genuine sense of pride. So that's about it.  Maybe I'll get back to teaching someday, but for the time being, I guess I'm pretty happy where I'm at. Oh Hello, Tracy. So what brings you here? Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into? Good for you.  Good for you So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical? Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour. Handles pretty good, don't you think? Plenty of pep, too. And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard. So Tracy? Why are you doing this? Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me? Well, I... I... that's very nice of you. What's this? I don't understand.  What's the deal? Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him. Oh, is this...? (thumbing through it) God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time. What a surprise. You'll be fine. You will."
chinatown,GITTES ,Jack Nicholson," All right, enough is enough. You can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. I just had 'em installed on Wednesday. Down the hatch. What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right. You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.  Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake. What's that, Curly? Oh they don't? I'll tell you the unwritten law, you dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be rich to kill somebody, anybody and get away with it. You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kind of class? You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.  Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point... I don't want your last dime.  What kind of guy do you think I am? Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly. How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray? Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?  No, really? I am sorry. I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself. Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone? Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?  Then go home and forget about it.  I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing. All right, what's your husband's first name?  Water and Power?  This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time. Very well. We'll see what we can do. Morning, Sophie. Walsh here? Where'd he go yesterday? Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain. Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something. Oh yeah? You pick up the watch? He was there all night.  So what you got?  This? What about? Apple core? Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing? Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse. Yeah, Sophie?  Duffy, where are you?  Okay, slow down  Echo Park.  Jesus, water again.  Let's have a big smile, pal.  Look at that.  What's that, pal? Oh? What do you do to make ends meet? Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on? Neither do I. Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer? Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank. C'mon, get out of the barber chair. We'll go outside and talk this over. I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living. An honest living. Duffy, Walsh.  Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.  Sophie. So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife. Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...  ...and then they stop and they read a little Confucius and they screw some more and they stop and they smoke some opium and then they go back and screw some more and they stop again and they contemplate the moon or something and it makes it more exciting. So this other guy goes home to screw his wife and after a while he stops and gets up and goes into the other room only he reads Life Magazine and he goes back and he screws some more and suddenly says excuse me a second and he gets up and smokes a cigarette and he goes back and by this time his wife is getting sore as hell. So he screws some more and then he gets up to look at the moon and his wife says, 'What the hell do you think you're doing?  ...you're screwing like a Chinaman.' Yes? Well... I think I... I would've remembered. Well, no. Never. Not that Mulwray? Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...  ...there's some misunderstanding here. It's not going to do any good to get tough with me.  There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy. That's a filthy habit. Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too. All she needed for that was the phone book! When I find out who that phony bitch was. Sophie. Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.  Whitey, what's new, pal?... Yeah, listen, where did you get those photographs... Yeah, blowing a fuse over the El Macando love nest.  That's cute, Whitey... so who sent them to you... I sent them? (Gittes laughs a little hysterically) Why would I be asking how you got them if I sent them?... Whitey?... Whitey?... C'mon, level with me for once, my tit's in the wringer and it's beginning to hurt... yeah... yeah... yeah.  They're all a bunch of phonies. Mr. Mulwray, please. Gittes. It's personal. Has he been out long? Gee whiz. (he glances at his watch) And I'm late. Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?  J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter. And Mulwray isn't? Maybe he takes it very seriously. You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch? Well, tell him I'll be back.  Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again. Mulvihlll, what are you doing here? How'd you find out? You don't drink it, you don't take a bath in it, maybe they sent you a letter. Ah, but then you'd have to be able to read.  Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here? J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.  Yeah sure. Bad for glass. Actually, I'm here to see your husband, Mrs. Mulwray. What are you having? Yeah. Fine, thank you. Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando. Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.  I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke. What? Mrs. Mulwray? I don't want to drop it. I should talk this over with your husband. Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.  You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem. May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?  Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere. Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just -- Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning? Looks like you went quite a distance. I'll stop by.  It's all right. Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department. Loach. Before what? What the hell's going on?  How are you, Lou? Summer colds are the worst.  Thanks, Lou. Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little. I get by. Yeah. Tell me, you still throw Chinamen into jail for spitting on the laundry? Since when? Congratulations. Looking for someone. Hollis Mulwray. You seen him? I'd like to talk to him.  Just before the story broke in the papers, Lou. No. No. I'll walk her to her car, be right back. Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.  You left your keys in the ignition.  A check? Don't give me that, Lou. You hauled me down here for a statement. No? You mean that's what you're going to call it. What'd he do, Lou, make a pass at your sister? Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with? Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.  Yeah. Banged up pretty bad. So how are you, Morty?  Yeah, so who you got there? Yeah. Come again? The L.A. River? It's bone dry, Morty. Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon. Jesus, this town...  You were riding here the other day, weren't you...?  Speak English?... Habla Ingles? Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...  What did you talk about, mind my asking? What about the water? When it comes? What'd you tell him?  Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.  I understand...  Yeah, Sophie. Who? Don't know her. Take a number. I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs. Sue the shit out of 'em. Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives. Okay.  Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.  Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions? When did you come in?  Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying? I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both. ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over? The obituary column? 'Those people?' Miss Sessions. Thanks for coming... drink? I got your check in the mall. Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough. Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story. I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset. Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police. If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence. I think you're hiding something, Mrs. Mulwray. How did you find out? He told you?  And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it? You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.  Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.  She's cheating on him.  Were you? Did you have affairs? Did he know? Where you were when your husband died. You mean you don't know where you were? You were seeing someone, too. For very long? Oh, by the way. What's the 'C' stand for? That your maiden name? No reason.  No. I'm just a snoop. No, not for that one.  Do me a favor. Sit still and act like I'm charming.  There's somebody here. Say something. Anything. Something like we're being intimate.  Been meaning to talk to you about that.  More like other people putting their business in my nose. Mrs. Match. How're you? Okay. Another satisfied client's wife. Sweaty? Let's get out of here before she picks up her purse.  Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me. Okay, go home. But in case you're interested your husband was murdered. Somebody's dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when we're supposedly in the middle of a drought, he found out, and he was killed. There's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue. Involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they don't. It looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs. Mulwray.  I goddam near lost my nose! And I like it. I like breathing through it. And I still think you're hiding something. J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton. Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait. I take a long lunch. All day sometimes. Julian Cross worked for the water department?  He did or he didn't? He owned the water department? He owned the entire water supply for the city?  How did they get it away from him?  Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department. They were partners. Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.  I cut myself shaving. Only when I breathe. I never was. Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me. Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned. Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news. Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards? That's like saying they're in Arizona. You're a married man, am I right? Hard working, have a wife and kids... I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years. Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty for each of my operators, plus expenses, plus my fee if I show results. Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know. Sophie, draw up one of our standard forms for Mrs. Mulwray. (he leans back; to Evelyn) Tell me, did you get married before or after Mulwray and your father sold the water department?  Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he? So you married your father's business partner?  You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray. Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father? Over the water department, or over you?  Then it was over the water department. Oh, yeah? Never forgave him for what?  You sure shout that? What about you? Do you and your father get along? Sign here... The other copy's for you.  Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.  What? Not exactly.  I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him? I'm working for his daughter. She ain't exactly long in the tooth now. You must be thinking of a different daughter. She ran away?  Well, you never know, do you? Why'd she run away?  We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal? You don't say? Sir? Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.  Always?  Thanks. It doesn't hurt. Probably. No. She happens to think the last one was murdered. I think I gave it to her. Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way. They're calling it an accident. Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant. Oh yes. We worked in Chinatown together. Very. Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do. None. Too bad?  My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results. If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross. What for? It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown. Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers. His girlfriend? You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando? Yeah. No. She's probably scared to death. Maybe. You didn't see Mulwray much, did you? When was the last time? Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray? Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.  I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about? What about her? I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other. If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about. How did you find out? Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her? I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves. We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross. I'm a little lost. Where can I find the plat books for the northwest valley? I'll settle for L.A. County. Hauls the huge volume back to the Clerk's desk.  Say... uh... sonny. How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book? Then these are all new owners?  But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months. Can I check one of these volumes out? Well, then, how about a ruler? The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.  Say, pal, what's he doing? Well, you're just the man I'm looking for. Some associates and I are thinking of buying property out here. Of course, we're worried about the rainfall. Yeah. (glancing around at the desolate, dry field) Do you have any references?  That's swell. But how about here? (pulling out names from his pocket) Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb? Yeah. Yeah, I'll do that.  Get away from me! Touch me with that thing again and you'll need a pair of them.  Name's Gittes. I'm a private investigator and I'm not with either one. Client hired me to see... whether or not the water department's been irrigating your land. Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. Mulwray's dead. You don't know what you're talking about, you dumb Oakie.  What's going on? It's okay, Mr. Dubois. Thanks, Earl. Thanks for coming... That dam is a con job. The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here. Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today. (whips out papers, turns on the car light) That bother you?  In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres. Know him? Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid. It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.  We got it. We got it, baby. There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago. Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual. Yes, I sure hope so. It's Dad. (indicating his disheveled appearance) I just can't handle him anymore, can I, sweetheart?  Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually. Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object. There's just one question. Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?  Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey? Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?  That's exactly what we wanted to hear. I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around? Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own? We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.  They're all here. Every goddam name.  You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire. They may not know it but they are. Hello, girls.  Which one of you is Emma Dill? Are you Emma? I've been wanting to meet you. Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman? Well you own a lot of land. That's just lovely.  Where did you get this material? The apple core? How do they do that?  But what? See you later, Emma.  Can we leave the lady out of this? Okay, I'd like to walk her to her car.  Get in the car.  What are you waiting for? Get in the car!  Maid's night off?  What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all. Easy, it's an innocent question.  I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight. What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?  Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time. Why? It was in Chinatown.  Working for the District Attorney. As little as possible. They do in Chinatown. No. I wonder... could I. Do you have any peroxide or something? Yeah. Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was... You can't always tell what's going on there. I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt. Yeah. Make sure I don't find myself in Chinatown anymore. Wait a second. Your eye.  There's something black in the green part of your eye. ...A flaw... Where? And I want to know where.  Where are you going? The Albacore Club. I know. I saw him. This morning. There hasn't been a lot of time. That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do. Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was. Give me an example. That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing? Including the death of your husband? Okay, give me the keys. It's either that or you drive to the police yourself. C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there! You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will. Then let's go talk to her. What about? You mean she just found out? That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray. Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell. Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know. I will if you don't. Take it easy... If it's your sister it's your sister... why all the secrecy? Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?  I took your husband's Buick... (he opens the car door) I'll return it tomorrow. Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.  Yeah, well... I'm very tired, Mrs. Mulwray. Good night. Yeah. Who? Yeah?... I do? Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office. Didn't you call? I don't. Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.  Nope, your wife got excited, crossed her legs a little too quick. You understand, pal.  Yeah, I took 'em. So what? Either you tell me or I guess 'cause I don't have the answer. I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home. What pictures? Yeah? I heard it was an accident.  You accusing me of extortion? I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.  Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou. Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?  Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean. He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him. C'mon I'll show you.  C'mon make a decision, Lou. You're in charge.  It's too late. They only dump the water at night. I know what he says.  Because he just made lieutenant, and he wants to hang onto his little gold bar. Where's Mrs. Mulwray?  Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...  on a trip?... vacation?... Bad for glass. Can't quite believe what he's heard, Salt water? What's that... down there?  ...there. Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl. Do you remember the figures we discussed? At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here? Either that or she'll be in jail. Just bring your checkbook.  You wait. Yeah? Sure.  Where's the girl? I want to see her. Going somewhere? J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar  You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.  You know any good criminal lawyers? Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it. I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they? Yes positively. That's where he was drowned... There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license. Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no? Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister. That's good. Now what's her name? Katherine?... Katherine who? I said the truth! I said I want the truth. To Mexico... ...so that's why you hate him... Yeah... where are you taking her now? You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere. That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything. I'll take care of it. ...where does Kyo live? On his day off. Get the exact address. How do you know? Rises a little shakily from the arm of the sofa. Hello. Sure. It's Chinatown. Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda. I know where it is! Just do it.  Come on in, Lou. We're both too late. Looks like she flew the coop. Matter of fact I do. Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up. She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you. What for?  Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can. Yeah. Do me a favor, will you, Lou?  Let me bring her down myself... she's not armed or nothing... she won't be any problem... I'd just like a minute alone with her... It would mean something... to...  her... and to me.  I guess not. Gee, thanks, Lou. Call me Jake. How is everything? No thanks. Thanks just the same, Curly. I could use a glass of water, though. Come out with me to the kitchen for a second. Curly, where's your car? Where's that? Could you drive me somewhere? Right now, Curly. It can't wait.  Tell her later. Just drive slow for a block or two, will you, Curly? Tell you in a couple of blocks. How much do you owe me, Curly? Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight. I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred. I'll throw that in too. Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.  Curly, you know how long I been in business. I've got her. She's fine. With her mother. I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross. An obituary column... can you read in this light? That you killed Hollis Mulwray. Right here, in this pond. You drowned him...  and you left these. ...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs. Haven't the faintest idea. And that's what you were going to do in the Valley? There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting. How do you do that?  How much are you worth? I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million? Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?  Who do you blame for that? Her? No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get 'em out of here!  Let me handle that.  Sure, but I'd like to handle it. Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.  Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this. Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later. Let her go. She didn't kill anybody. Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.  Now take off.  No! Where is he? I'll kill him, I'll kill the son of a bitch.  Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him. An accident? Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!"
supergirl,SELENA ,Faye Dunaway," Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view. Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants. Why George, are you proposing? George---I thought you'd never ask. A squirrel Frisbee? That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, but I've never seen it before.  I've got things to do.  Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch. Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him. He's just a sore loser. What do you want? I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski. Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world. I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places. I just did. Because I have the Power. Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far. Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head. I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.  You Scorpios can never take a joke. Throw him out. Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a great honor you have given me, and I will try to be worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed -- you will learn that we are on the threshold of power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was our leader. And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the coming year... It's a warning, that's for sure.  There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs. Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit. Stop the car! I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall. The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it. What does it mean? Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game? It must be the girls. One of the girls. Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention. We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out. Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK? He will be. In about five minutes. Finished your estimate? Come in, have a drink, we'll talk. You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around. I bet they do. Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage. I just love plants and growing things. It must be wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers! But look, it's almost sundown! Just take a sip or .I'll be hurt. It's an old family recipe, I'm famous for them. A passionfruit smoothee. To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together. Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my eyes and be all mine. If that's the Jehovah's Witnesses again... Don't go away, gorgeous. I'll be right back. Nigel, get lost. You're wasting your breath. I could teach you a thing or two now. I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night. Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself. Ethan. Come back. You'll spoil everything! Show me Ethan. The silly fool! Power of Shadows...bring him to me. That was meant for me! It's what we were warned about. No, a super girl. Why did she have to show up now? That's easy for you to say, Bianca. Am I? Still? I've been saving it. For the right moment. Not even Nigel. What do I do?  I don't know her name. Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be. Find her and destroy her. Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard. I think I'd better keep it. Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.  This won't take long. Keep the motor running. What an adorable hat. And you think you're in love. This ""love"" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion. It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl. Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl? Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.  Here. Drink this. It's an antidote to the love drug I gave you. You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am. Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want. They're over for you sweetheart. Now you see who you're dealing with. This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you. Come back to my house. My car's outside. I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest! Power of Shadow---seize him. Give up? What goes up must come down. Come down from there, you foo1...  ...before you get blown off and kill yourself. It'll be dark soon. And cold. Come down while you've got the chance. She's not coming for you. I killed her. She's dead. You idiot! No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me. I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit whenever I want. What a touching scene! I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry. All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him, nobody can. Coffer of Shadow, show your Power! A cheap trick. Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. Ka-ma-hoochie! Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.  I don't feel like it right now. That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools. Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of the seven. There you are. Come to mama. You're late. You're more afraid of the President than me??? Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven. We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft. It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She knows we exist.. By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all. Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.  Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice? Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel? Nonsense. I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree? At last. Ultimate Power. What do you mean we? I could force you. Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten. You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week. Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry. I told you I'd win. Kiss me. Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever. Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age! I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And I bring you myself as her representative here on Earth. From this moment forth, all science, religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I will teach the One True Way of our ancient grandmothers. And it's about time too. Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. I have something better. They want me. Doesn't it make you proud? Coming? Smile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more, you're Prince Ethan now. Guess! Go on. You're a regular Einstein, aren't you? Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes. You can't put her out of your mind, is that it? I'm ready for her. I'll show you. Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the serpents will drop them one by one. That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan. You don't get this far without paying...a certain price. The Danvers. And two of your little friends. All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till the last card's dealt. Not yet. I'm free. I can never thank you enough. Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time. What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around here. What's it like? Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go. Where is inner space? Will they be angry with me for stealing the Power Source? Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel."
interstellar,COOPER ,Matthew McConaughey," Long way to come by bus. I thought you guys would have a plane. A little.  You don't make it, my boys won't get to see you lose.  Satellite. Big one. Probably Chinese. You ruin it for the boys when you talk like that. They didn't have any baseball at all when I was a kid. I thought okra wasn't susceptible. Something wrong with your truck? What does that have to do with anything? Get the spare, Tom. All right. We'll use the patch kit. Murph's law. Find something to patch it with. Figure it out. I'm not always going to be here to help you. Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will happen. All kinds of things. Good or bad. And that's the way you want it to be. Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything. Murph? Get in. It's a Chinese military drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.  Take the wheel. Keep it pointed right at it, OK? Faster, Tom. I'm losing it. Almost got it. Don't slow down.  No we didn't. You want to give it a whirl? Set her down in the valley -- there, next to the river. Chinese mission control went down same as us, twenty years ago. It's been up there ever since. It was looking for something. Intercepted some kind of signal.  It's been at eighty thousand feet. Sun probably cooked its brain. Reprogram it. Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor. We need all the help we can get, Murph. This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us. What about college? You're ruling out college for him now? He's only fifteen. What are you, about a 36-inch waist?  30-inch inseam? You're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son's future? Engineer. Are we done? One of my old textbooks. Murph liked the pictures. Corrected? You don't believe we went to the moon? ""Useless machines""? One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. You ever consider the best thing for the world and humanity might have been for us to part company? Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes. Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission to enter your airspace. Not exactly. Space probe. Never seen one like it, though. Looks like it's been to hell and back. Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago. Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open. Good boy. Hand me the scanner. Here we go. Standard NASA encryption. Memory's been damaged. Just noise. Hold on. I've got something. I don't know. Where the hell did you come from? We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow and have it melted down. Might be some copper inside. There's no one for it to report to. NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son. It got home too late. Maybe it's better for everyone to forget what they did back then. Reminds us how far we've fallen. It doesn't bother me that he can't go. It bothers me that he doesn't care. It's a fail-safe. It's going to annoy us into taking it home. We're going to get some sleep. You're staying here and cleaning the house. I told you, Murph. There's no one to take it back to. Got any diesel? I don't know. Don't touch them. Murph? Careful. There's some kind of underground facility here. We might... Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them for thirty years. I've never seen one intact before. I think we need to go, Murph. No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving.  Hit him in the back of the neck. We were just looking for salvage. I didn't know it belonged to anyone. You've got me wrong, lady.  Word of advice -- careful with that thing. When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting. Wait a second-- Now who's stealing from who? You're right. It belongs to NASA, which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money. Who are you people? Galveston. Canaveral's been gone for thirty years. Nothing. I got something off of it.  May I? Most of the disk was noise. Couple of clean sectors, though. There aren't any planets like that anywhere near earth. Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years. You can't keep us here. I'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have. Are you using that for guidance? The power supply is no good. If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail. Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida. Had to rebuild every last one.  They work great on a riding lawn mower. You plan on keeping us here forever? I guess no one told them they were out of a job.  Same as the rest of these people. I thought the old man was in charge. Not you?  You don't look like one.  With the rifle, I mean. That rocket doesn't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter. Why are you telling me this? I already told you I'm not going to tell anyone about this place. But I don't have any of the experience. Any training. You people have been preparing for this for years. No. I'm sorry. I can't help you. I have responsibilities. Things that, no offense, are more important than a scientific mission. Rescue? Rescue who? The blight. But it doesn't affect the corn.  No. No. We're rebuilding. We'll find something. Some new technology... We always have. You've known this for how long? And you didn't try to tell anyone?  That's why you're looking for a planet with oxygen. Water. But you'd still only be able to save a few hundred. Maybe a thousand. I can't go. I have to look after the boys. I have a responsibility to them-- You have to stay here, pal. There's going to be important work to do here, too. I need you to hold onto this. Will you do that for me? I will come back. I promise. Don't look so happy to see me. Great idea. A massive, sarcastic robot. That sounds like a good idea. I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies. So you're a salvage diver now? I thought you were a biologist. We're taking ants with us? I thought humans were more solitary. Looks like hard work. Is that a star? Lose time? How much time? Sure. Till we ran out of food and ate all of them.  I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars. We'll be back. Oh, no. I want to see this.  Good morning, sunshine. Bit of a demotion. The ship is tiny. I know. So why are you painting it? Sure it does.  You're pretty good. What'd you paint? How much do these things weigh? Damn. Why? Fine. The anesthetic is working.  You worry about my hand and I'll worry about my mood. Why? If we're such a liability, why take us along? You and Tars could build the colony without us. You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen. Humans aren't programmed. Did they program you to be condescending?  My relationships aren't programming. How would that make us better at surviving? No. I want to know. We've almost reached the wormhole.  Just in case anything happens, I just wanted to say...  I love you boys. And I hope whatever your lives become, whatever is coming your way... you make the most of it. I know. Thank you. You never had any? I thought I was a pariah for only having two. Strange place to look for a new home. You really think there's a plan? I guess I just think we're on our own.  No. Where are we? Something's happening to the hull over here. Well, I don't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here. Can you ask it to stop? It's working. We've lost contact with the relay. One long garbled transmission came in. Then nothing. What is he doing? What about Tars? I still can't contact the relay. Did you hear me? We're not able to communicate back home. How could they all have landed in the same place? We're bringing him along? This is the Taichung mission. They never landed. Not on Mars. Four human crew, fifteen robots. The log says the base has been here for thirty years. The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow. Then what? What about returning to the ship? What is this? Case, wait-- Breathe. Trust me. Your suit is filling with water. I'm not going to be able to hold it much longer. I'm going to let go. Take a deep breath. I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism. Don't mention it. Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice. We're down to three suits. We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth. Any sign of Brand? What happens then? Any sign of big life-forms? I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls. You don't know that. You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden. What's that supposed to mean? What? You know how plants don't usually move? Is that a universal rule? Hello there. OK. Now we run. We have to reach the shelter. This way. I've got you. By ""cooperate"" do you mean let it eat me? Then why are they killing each other?  What is it doing? I don't want it to incorporate me. WHY N- They're killing each other. I'd say they have a long way to go. But what are they competing for? Why not? What difference would that make?  Murph's Law.  The plan. I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help us. People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come.  I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us. We were on our own. Honestly? After the things I saw... you want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us? Because I'm not sure we're worth saving. Looks like they lost. But why didn't they come? Testing what?  Is that a chair? Everything in here is bolted down.  What do you think this thing does? I wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth. Old military-grade encryption. It's not very robust.  No offense. Hang on. That should open up most of it. No one was listening. How long does this place have?  Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe we just don't understand it yet. Case, what is that? No. It's closer than that.  Roth. Quick -- hold onto something.  I found it. Hold onto something. They found a way to make gravity. What does that mean? But how did the Chinese develop the technology? This would take decades, maybe hundreds of years, to create. I know this isn't exactly what you trained for. But I think Roth might be right. Don't make any sudden movements. They can't hurt us if we're unarmed. Further orders aren't coming. Your government is gone. It ran out of money, same as ours. You're on your own.  They're never going to let us go. Come on. We're too late. The main thruster fuel supply. We're not going anywhere. But we need to take the box back to earth. I'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled, but it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back. Let me take it. We're going to find out soon enough. Where's Brand? Dammit. If I don't make it back, just keep going.  Get that thing home.  I don't know.  I figured if you were floating out into space, you'd want some company. Guess you were right -- too much gravity, or not enough. Roth. How is that working? Good. We've already set the course, skipper. We're going home. Now I know why we weren't able to hit the relay. It's not interference -- the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be. Nothing.  Wait. The ship cached one long garbled transmission when we first fell into the swirl. If we account for the blue shift then the computer might find something in there. How much? Forty seven years. We could bypass the relay. Send a conventional shortwave signal. You knew, didn't you? You and Case figured it out when we landed. Sure you could. You're brilliant. You know everything. They're not children any more... if they're even still alive. Yes she did. That's why you were upset -- your father. We can't let that happen. We'll lose more time... too much... We're losing years. What will happen to it?  This is the crew of the Endurance. We... (gives up on FORMALITIES) Murph, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't make it back, like I promised. All of those people back home... none of them will make it. Case said the Chinese found something else. The location was scrubbed from their records. But I bet he knows it. Here. Can we reach it?  That? What is it? Where are we? Not a single drink on the whole ship. What kind of mission is this? You really think we're the last humans alive anywhere? So that's it, then? That's all? What about the plan? The grand scheme. I didn't. But you were bringing me round. What the hell was the point? What did it add up to? This? You're saying the end result of ten billion years is the atoms from dead stars standing here disagreeing with each other. This thing is made of... gravity? Can we communicate with them? What is that? There's something out there. This is what the Chinese were protecting.  How they could have built all this in just a handful of years. Must have taken you a while. How are they keeping the lights on in this thing? It's a map? So why didn't they return? Why didn't they save us? They weren't interested in the other wormholes because their mission was to return home. That one leads back to Earth. The Earth they were told to return to. Did they make it? We're going to find out. You don't know that. I made a promise. You could have taken one of the other ships. Where are you going to go? You're going, too? I'm sorry. I have to find out what happened to my sons. I promised them. I promise. The probe... It's going to work. That's not what I mean. This is the probe I found in Galveston. Brand said there'd be some evidence we'd made it. And there was. This.  But only this. Everything will be destroyed except for this. We have to stop. You don't need to do this. We won't make it back, but this does. The secrets are already right on it. Maybe someone found it. There's hope.  But we don't get to go with.  This is the crew of the Endurance... Murph... I'm sorry... Where am I? What's coincidence? What is this place? Where... where are we? Shoot. It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed. Because that was the plan.  I don't know. Feel like I should be pulling my weight. I was hoping to enroll in a course. Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems. No one's heard anything from Brand? Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? I just need a small ship. I made a promise. Curiosity. New level setting. 100 percent. Sense of humor. New level setting. 100 percent. Wait.  80 percent. Where do you want to go first?"
pandorum,BOWER ,Ben Foster," Where were you... when Eden was lost? Like every other kid on my block, I was in the middle of a dream, envious of those who were chosen to be part of mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of the unknown and trying to imagine what only the lucky few would encounter. We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and... Where was I... when I heard we'd lost Eden? Just like every other kid on my block... I was dreaming... of being one who would be chosen to follow. As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass. We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and... Burns are red! Bruises... blue- His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet, muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white. Hey...? HEY!!? Someone? A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal... A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black. We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown with no result and compartments are pulled opened and... SNAP! A glow stick comes to life. He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into his mouth as possible. After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping. He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY. The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask. Payton? Lieutenant... Payton? He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar. Bower? Bower...? The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal. Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer. Bower. He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar. He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005015. He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool belt with a high powered pen-lamp. On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises, labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures.  .in the event of mild memory loss... resulting from extended- He freezes on... A PHOTO tucked inside the door. EVALON, a beautiful young woman smiling towards camera. He stares at the-photo, his frown deepening with confusion. He checks the back for a name, but nothing. He tucks the photo into a pocket and exits. Faa-uck! Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and toward the sounds... PAYTON'S sleep chamber. THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the hatch bursting open. Out climbs... PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock. Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You're- Sir... whoa! PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once over with a frown and a sobering tone. Bower. Corporal... Bower, sir. I'm the- That's right. You're waking from Yes, sir. This is disorientation from- Yes. That's right, I'm- Sorry... sir. PAYTON rubs his face with a frown. We're aboard the Elysium. From what I've I don't... really know. There's no power in the com and I can't even- I believe so. Sir... I don't know where anyone is. PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing around at their darkened surroundings. Ah... we're having some power problems- Umm, not sure. It had to have been the flight computer. There's no one here...  .except us. There's no power coming off the main grid. Can't fire any of the...  Dynos. Can't even open the doors. PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown.  Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where he is. It was empty when I woke up. None of the systems are on-line. Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or why it engaged independently- Yeah? Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you awake. i was... a little concerned. I didn't know what to do if- PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under the arm as they stagger into the wall. Easy... Lieutenant. Easy. I'm on it. This is you, sir. 1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir. PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo of WIFE  inside the door. He stares at it with utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory recovery card inside the locker. it says that the memory loss is only suppose to be a momentary loss that's- I've been awake for at least an hour and I still can't remember my... anything. What was... your last flight, sir? Sir? I know this is going to sound strange, but do you even know where we're going? I can remember the training, but... not the mission. Know the procedures, not the... destination. Didn't even know the ship's name until I saw it-on the console. For all I know this was another damn training exercise- None of the activators are working. Without the mainframe, we can't connect. I don't know how we'll ever be able to- PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of electricity to the light panels. Oh, I- didn't even think of that. Five. Team Four suppose to be here for the shift rotation. Where could they be? Where could he have gone? PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass and the computer screens slowly fade, going black. Whatta ya think? Somebody... is up there. Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out.  Well, he got out... some how. A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head as it fades. Cycle is broken. It's not circuitry. Reactor timing is off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but it's not. Each revolution decreasing before starting over from the beginning. It's trying to reconnect, but it won't until it's reset. I dunno. I can't remember my own- but I know everything there is to know about that damn reactor. And I know that... Another SHUDDER approaches. That's twelve revolutions, before recycling. And this one will only last- As they watch the ceiling, their flashlight beams stop on a small ventilation shaft that's been ripped open. They exchange a look and... Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this way. Don't you think? It's the only way out. For what? If the mainframe is off-line- But we can at least find out what's But, we can at least try to- Can't do... Sir? You're... claustrophobic? You can guide me... over two-way. PAYTON eyes him over with reluctance. You know there's something wrong. How long can we wait in here before we have to try something?  How long did he wait? Silent stare as a SHUDDER passes, flickering the lights. What if no one else is awake and there's no one at the wheel? Yeah... I think so. What do-you remember? Anything yet? And you're the cranky old bastard who made me take the aisle. Nothing yet. Christ, not a single vent opening or- Nothing. How about on your end? Hey? BOWER quickly pushes himself forward reaching an intersection in the shaft. Got an intersection here. A whole lot of the same... nothing. Don't say that. BOWER lowers his head, breathing heavily.  I'll be damned. BOWER collects himself, a tightened jaw of determination. I'm taking a left. Make a note. Payton!? Do you copy!? HEY!? Finally... I dunno. I dunno if I can- I can't tell if I'm going in circles or- There's nothing to- Can't breath- I just want... to stand up for God's sakes! Can't breath- Back!? Are you kidding- I can't turn around! I can't even- Do you know how far I've gone!? I just want OUT of this FUCKING THING! I can't... breath! Like WHERE!? WHAT!? Are you fucking kidding me!? What's that? Dream like that, sounds like you've got some... guilt issues. Two years? You said two years. You think we've been asleep for two years?  That can't be right. Why would I-leave her? I can't even remember saying good-bye. Why would I? Different... how? Someone's been through here. Someone's been... BOWER notices the droplets of sweat dripping off his chin are rolling forward across the shaft floor with a frown. Wait a second- I'm... I'm at an angle! Shit! No, no... N00000! He slides head first into a vertical drop, the shaft tightening like a funnel, crushing his lungs and SLAM! He crashes into a steel grate where his flashlight lays. It's a nightmarish head stand, his neck twisted with all his weight on top of himself, squirming with no where to squirm. Aaaaeirrrgh! I'm... out! I'm- PAYTON breathes a heavy sigh of relief. I'm- I'm inside a boot locker! I'm inside a God damn- He shoves outward and the door SNAPS open. He falls out, flips through the air and SLAMS to the floor, an IMPACT on the radio sends... Make that an overhead compartment. You with me, Payton? I got out. Hear me? He checks the transmitter, crackling with static. Payton? You there...? He cautiously ventures down the corridor as LIGHTS FLICKER past, getting a quick glimpse of just how incredibly far the corridors run. He steps up to an intersection of corridors, adjusting the frequency on his radio. Payton? Can you hear me!? Dead static. He sighs, looking down each of the corridors, all appearing identical and endless. Which way is which? I He examines the piping that runs along the ceiling, checking the direction of the valves and guesses, picking a direction. He walks to the edge of the next corridor and pauses with a frown. Glancing down the side corridor, fifty yards away, something is off. Within the symmetrical framing of steel, there is a rounded shape that is out of place. Be cautiously steps closer as the object takes the shape of... a MAN, standing at the edge of a doorway, head slightly cocked, peeking out. Hey...!? BOWER freezes, caught in a silent stand-off, the MAN'S motionless stare is unsettling. Hello...? A low RUMBLE approaches as LIGHTS FLICKER past to reveal... The MAN'S face, hauntingly contorted, swollen features. The MAN is dead, hanging from a cable around his neck, naked and gutted like an animal, his feet hanging an inch off the floor. His face is brutally beaten. Jesus... Christ. Jesus- BOWER back pedals with fear and confusion as distant THUMPS make him quickly click off his light and he backs away, fading into the dark. His whisper fades. What-!? He tries to look up and... CRACK! Instant swelling over his eye from a hit. She kicks the envelope opener away. Wait- I'm part of the crew! I'm- I won't! Please! Just listen- I'm not- What!? Alright, alright! Take it easy! He begins to remove his shoes and the radio on his belt suddenly CRACKLES with activity. Stop! Stop it! Listen to me! Hold it! she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to fend her off. She throws the blade, the blunt end deflecting off his forearm. You crazy fucking bitch- He wields the only weapon he can find... his shoe. And her attack abruptly halts, slowly back pedalling with fright. BOWER is confused, realizing her eyes are looking past him. A BLUISH GLOW seeps in from the doorway, approaching from the corridor. He looks back to see NADIA is running for the kitchen... gone.  What the hell is- The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on the spear-device, killing the blue flame and taking us instantly into darkness. BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark. He takes an uneasy breath to realize... there is more then one. Slowly moving out of the shadows, four more HUNTERS slowly emerge, like a unified pack on the prowl. They carry an assortment of crudely made weapons, spears and blades of sharpened metal. The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN, the largest and strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an assortment of odd vocal sounds, deep HISSES from the throat and gargled CACKLES. On command, the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid. The hunt continues, the pack weaving through the debris, following NADIA'S path. As the BLUISH GLOW fades, BOWER is left bewildered and terrified. Suddenly, his radio sounds... But, why would she try to kill me!? She was going to slit my throat! And why would they look like that? You should have seen these guys. They were... a very fucked up looking gang. Why the hell would they be-- Payton, they were hunting. BOWER gives himself a shiver as he fearfully checks over his shoulder, eyes shifting with fear. They sure-as-shit weren't a welcoming party from the Promenade deck! These guys were... looking to do some damage. We've got to try to contact the bridge. You're not!? We're not the only ones awake. Team Four wouldn't go back to sleep without waking us for rotation. Maybe they're on the main deck? Maybe they can't. With the systems kicking on and off- Maybe they're flying blind, with no control of the LFS? PAYTON eyes the scattered tools across the floor and the ripped open ventilation shaft. What are you talking about? PAYTON glances across the control console, nodding with more memories returning. .Tanis. Planetary processing and population. We're a settler's vessel.  How could I have... left her? Why would I have done that? I loved her... BOWER snaps out of his trance. Payton!? Where is your wife? We didn't leave them behind. No one did. They're on this flight! Remember the recruitment. The fucking breeding tests- The wives, the husbands- The- She's on this God damn flight! They're here. Somewhere on board. I've got to find her... before those fucking animals do! I've got to- BOWER ransacks the compartments, tossing aside items. Try to think of where they would be? A sleeping compartment for non-service What's there to think about!? I remember! There was thousands of passengers that weren't part of the development team. Families that- But... how do we- I r PAYTON Where are you?  I dunno. Officer's quarters, somewhere above D-level, I think- I don't- Guide me to where? I'm not coming back to you. What good would that do? I can't open that door from the other side-- Listen... if you can get me to the reactor bay. I can... reset the reactor's cycle.  Eden. The Eden. PAYTON nods, memories returning as he mumbles the name. I'm just thinking, maybe there's something we haven't considered. Eden failed... because of ODS syndrome. The one officer who was suffering from Pandorum. Cabin Fever. Maybe there was something similar with one of the earlier That was the report... but don't you remember the story of the one flight officer... the real story? They say he went lunar, launched the entire ship, five thousand people killed with the flip of a switch. All from a bad case of cabin fever-? And why did they switch the rotation shifts from three years to two? And they eliminated the manual over-ride- Well, at least we didn't wake up... floating away in a coffin. Something happened to the other team? Maybe there was... Pandorum. BOWER looks to his own hand, cradling the weapon... his FINGERS gently TREMBLING. He makes a fist and shakes his hand, firmly grabbing the weapon. This can't be right- Have I done a circle or am I doubling back? I've seen this before. This- We follow his flashlight to reveal... a BODY tangled in a wire snare. It appears to be the same dead body he witnessed before, but as he steps closer, it's different. This body has ripped clothing and isn't gutted. It's... SHEPARD, a thin-framed man in a torn crew uniform, tangled in a wire snare wrapped tightly under his arm and around his neck. a different one. There's booby-traps, rigged to the- SHEPARD'S eyes POP open wide with a terrified expression, completely silent until BOWER sees him. BOWER jumps with fright and SHEPARD wildly squirms, SCREAMING bloody-murder. Stop it! Jesus, I'm not gonna- SHUT-UP! He's... team six. The unit that's suppose to follow us. He's- Quiet! I'm not gonna hurt you! SHEPA.RD begins to moan, mumbling and weeping as he rubs circulation back into his limbs with nervous laughter. Hey? You with me? You're gonna be alright. Hear me? Squinting past the glare of the flashlight, SHEPARD notices BOWER'S clean uniform and the radio boom on his chin. He begins to weep, tears of joy and agony. Huh? Squad? My Lieutenant and I were the- Shuttle? What are you talking about? SHEPARD'S expression drops. No, no. Hold on. I'm from this crew. I'm from Team Five. SHEPARD'S face goes pale, eyes going hollow. His demeanor slowly begins to shift. six... maybe eight hours ago. I had to crawl all the way from the upper deck That's what we're trying to figure out! Tell me- what happened!? I don't know anything. What are you doing? What ! ? SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the corner, wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a screwdriver into his hand. Help.me? Wait a second- They- Who the hell are they!? God dammit, WAIT! You're still an officer of this ship and at present time, your CO is ordering you to- Payton...? They got him! They fucking ripped him apart! They're- Aaaargh! Footsteps are heard approaching overhead. On the floor below him are his weapon and flashlight. He stretches for the gun... too far from his reach. The flashlight is ""on"", illuminating the area. He pushes off the wall and reaches for it... fingers touching, but unable to grab it. The GLOW of torches grows in the loading shaft and BOWER pushes off, reaching for the flashlight. Unable to retrieve it, instead he pushes it... into the open loading shaft. It drops all the way to the bottom as... Please... don't- Please, listen- The FIGURE slashes BOWER'S sleeve, rips away the fabric and looks at his identification tattoo. BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the light with a curious frown. TANAKA, a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing. Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS, he has a full- framed, hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes. What...? I don't understand. I- I don't speak- TANAKA jabs a finger into the emblems on BOWER'S uniform. I'm sorry. I don't- Do you... speak English? Thanks. Thanks for... that. TANAKA is dead pan. BOWER flinches as TANAKA picks up the energy gun and then... flips it over, handing it back to him. BOWER cautiously accepts as he climbs to his feet. I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know what you- TANAKA jabs the emblem on his uniform and presents his own You're with... agriculture!? Jesus... Listen, I'm not- TANAKA jabs the emblem on BOWER'S chest, taps his tattoo. Yes! I know! I'm with the flight crew! But, I don't know what's happened! I Listen, I'm going to find out what went wrong... with the ship. Yes, I'm going to the reactor to try to- Right. It doesn't really matter- You should stay put. Or go back to your compartment sector- Wait for the security systems to engage. Okay? We're gonna take care of this problem. Dead pan. Okay? BOWER slowly backs away and TANAKA follows. BOWER stops, I eyeing his numerous bladed weapons. No. Listen, you should stay. Wait here... for the systems to- Alright? Stay! TANAKA frowns as BOWER backs away, gesturing. BOWER reaches the next intersection and looks back. TANAKA is gone. He continues down the corridor as LIGHTS FLICKER past. Knock it off! Both of ya! TANAKA and NADIA slowly recover, both quickly try to find their weapons on the floor. Listen... nobody needs to get hurt here. Both of you just... cool out. And stop throwing that shit. Her eyes dart with uneasiness as she finds her knife. Let's all just... go easy here. I understand it's been every man for himself around here lately, but if we're going to get out of this- A little God damn solidarity wouldn't hurt. We can work together here. We all want the same thing... right? NADIA remains poised, ready to fight, knife raised. Sighing with defeat, BOWER gestures, hands raised as he motions for TANAKA and they slowly back towards the door.  Thanks... again. TANAKA motions toward the emblem on his uniform and gestures to himself. Yeah, yeah. I get it. We can work together on this, right? TANAKA grins. As long as we understand each other. They head out of the room as... NADIA watches from the shadows with a curious frown. Yeah... well no sympathy here. She left me with a few sore spots too, pal. They both go to work, attempting to wedge the door open with pipes. BOWER looks back to see... NADIA. They back pedal with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected, watching them with a frown. Listen, lady. We don't want any- Huh? Yeah. I'm... a corporal, I'm- That's what I'm trying to figure out. Malfunction of some sort- I'm heading for the reactor bay. Just joining the program already in progress, yeah. She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised. Oh yeah? And why is that? Hey? Wait a second- HEY? Hold on. Who are you? Wait- Can't join the team without a name. Because I need you to show me the way. Hold on. Please- There's not much time left before we lose everything onboard. You understand what I'm trying to- I'm working on it. Huh? My thoughts exactly. Where are we going? What are we doing- Waiting for what-? Who are they? What the hell are those things? They're not- They can't be from this ship. They don't seem... human. Do you think something got on board or maybe I something... He turns to follow her and pauses to see... The BIO-VAULT. A large lab storage compartment that has been ""lived-in"" for a long time. A bed has been created from assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of scavenged items. NADIA adds to the items, dumping the belongings of her bag onto the floor. BOWER is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass test tubes, a maze of micro-biological containers, glimmering with condensation. What is... all this? You've been living in here? You're... protecting it?  Tanis. No, I- I didn't remember just how far away it is... until now. This was a hundred and twenty-three year flight. NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag. TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination, tapping the tubes to see movement inside. How could I have forgotten that? How could we have become like this... in only eight years? NADIA ponders the thought, rotating her jaw. She digs into her supplies and tosses him a small block of orange material. What is this? How long? You think we've over slept? Do you have a radio? I'm not the only flight crew officer awake. We're not in this alone. I'd prefer to stay on foot. And what is that? Where are we? Jesus... As they venture deeper inside they see numerous sleep- chambers, open hatches and empty. The further they move along the wall, more and more empty pods, too many to count. My God. They're... empty. They're all- Where the hell is everyone? Wait a second. My wife- No, wait. My wife could be in here. BOWER'S focus completely shifts, turning towards the pods, reading name plates. She's not part of the crew, but spouses were brought with. I remember there were- Do you know where the family members are- I don't see what he's looking at, do you? Let's get out of here! Com'on- The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows. BOWER hesitates, turning to follow NADIA through a barricade of dishevelled equipment, leaving TANAKA behind. We can't just leave him. We have to wait- We can't split up the team, it's all The guy saved my life twice already. I'm not gonna leave him- How the hell should I know- Wait! I'm coming- There's a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light, picking up a small white object. He brings it closer to the light to realize it's... A HUMAN FINGER BONE. Jesus! NADIA turns toward him to see... What the... what the hell is it!? The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright. NADIA continues back pedalling, looking towards the rafters to see... HEFLIN silhouetted, leering towards them. What is he... doing? BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows begin to move.., the room is filling with HUNTERS, alerted by the tapping of metal. They're... everywhere- What the hell happened to them!? What the hell are those things!? I second that. Let's get the fuck out of here. Which way did we come from? No, I mean... let's just go! You said there was no other path. Which way did they go-? They'll hear him- They'll- We've got to Didn't we come through here already? Out? Why did we come iii-? I thought you knew where you were going. Could've mentioned that after the first mile. If I would have known we'd be doing laps down here- She angrily turns towards him, pipe in her hand. What the hell is that? They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT. They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see... Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and various food containers. The tank appears empty. What is this!? BOWER and TANAKA begin to climb through and NADIA hesitates with uncertainty. They crawl through the hatch... Get back! BACK! BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises the barrel towards the hatch, nearly point blank. KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there's a BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks. LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock. Shut off the gas! You... live here? Left? Have you seen any? Captain? Where!? Why don't you come on down so we can meet properly? Where do you think we are? The reactor bay. Know where it is? How long have you been awake? Those things out there. Could it have been something... that crawled out of your lab? Something that- Then something got on board. Some kind of life form. Something that- What does that mean? What? But, why would- You're saying we'll become like them? Why would they be affected like that and we're not- What is that... saying? LELAND cranks a power lever, speeding up the play back with eagerness, whispering along. The recording slowly grows less distorted the more he cranks the lever. Play that transmission again. I want- I dunno. It can't be- It just- What are you doing!? What the- It's gone... into the final cycle. it means we have less time then I thought. The last phase... before shutdown. It means we're... done. BOWER is oddly defeated, taking a seat, hanging his head. What difference does it make? For what? They're gone. Everything is gone. There's no Earth to go back to, And what is left of us? What's left, worth saving? This flight's over. NADIA is angered by his defeat, shoving LELAND aside and squaring off in front of BOWER. She's dead. I know... NADIA grabs him with rage, glaring him in the eye. You got a radio? Payton? Do you copy? Can you hear me!? He grabs the receiver. Storage Tanks, just below B-level. Mid- ship Sector twelve... we think. The ship is dying and I think that's why it finally woke us up. The entire system is heading into permanent shutdown and there will be no return. This entire ship will float off into eternity with no way of stopping it. We need to reset it. Are you hearing me? PAYTON and GALLO share a silent stare. What? TANAKA motions toward the hatchway, shaking his head. He i gestures for them to follow and leads them over debris and through a hole, hidden in the paneling. I dunno. But do what he says. They follow TANAKA, crawling through the hole and into... Child! ? That's no child! What the hell is it!? TANAKA lunges, but NADIA blocks his attack. The CHILD HUNTER erupts with a horrific SCREECH, HISSING at them before turning and leaping back up and over the rafters, disappearing into the shadows. They are speechless. What!? What do you mean they? How could they- That's impossible. It appears the CHILD has alerted his group as the BLUISH GLOW of flame can be seen growing stronger in the corridor, the sounds of CACKLES and HISSES approaching. Why not? She's not here. She's dead. She's not on this flight. She wouldn't come with me. She wouldn't marry me.  That's why I came. There was nothing left for me there. She stayed on Earth. Gone... with everyone else. And I left because of her. His gaze begins to gloss over, taking it all in. Marianne. I remember her. Payton's wife. I remember her. I remember- His eyes pull focus, coming out of his daze, memories returning with confusion. Com'on. This is our chance. BOWER leads the way out of the hiding place, heading quickly towards the open hatch where an eerie glow and rumble is felt. They crawl through the hatch and enter into... This is it. We've got to get down there before they come back. BOWER looks for a path downward along the tangled metal of catwalks, coated in algae. LELAND'S fear has instantly surfaced, unable to move. Com'on... NADIA looks back to see there are still HUNTERS in the reactor bay, ones who didn't join the chase, slowly coming out of the shadows, crawling up the walls. I'm going as fast as I can- Go... GO! GO! Half way up, LELAND looks back to see them coming with HUNTERS close behind. He gives them a look before closing the hatch and latching it. That's it! GO! Go for it! With HUNTERS hot on their trail... they run full sprint towards the sliding doors. HUNTERS lunge out of side corridors with SCREECHING HISSES as BOWER and NADIA dive through the sliding doors... One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with a heavy THUD of steel and a MOAN of hydraulics. The HUNTER spasms wildly, kicking and clawing as BOWER and NADIA back pedal into the room. HUNTERS gather at the gap, stabbing weapons between the doors, trying to crawl through with SCREECHES and HISSES of rage. He's not my lieutenant. She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead. BOWER pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading towards the bridge as NADIA follows behind. Flight log. It'll tell us how long we've I been out... and how far we've gone. BOWER types in a command and the computer begins to scroll through the flight computer's time-code. Starting with the launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and faster. BLIP... BLIP... BLIP. Seems my little memory lapse has finally worn off... ""Lieutenant"". BOWER slowly approaches, moving closer to his profile, the stream of blood from GALLO'S ear shown running down his neck. Who the hell are you? GALLO keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless. You're team four. Why would you... switch bunks? Pretend to be someone else? What would you be wanting to hide? Who the hell are you? You were the one... who first received the final transmission. Who refused to go back to sleep. You stayed awake... for all those years. What were you doing... what crimes were you hiding from when you took Payton's bunk? The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into decades... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP. Is it true? What have you done to us? Where are we now? GALLO lazily nods towards the windows. And that makes it okay? To play God? Judgement will come for you. You think you could cover it? Your victims survived. Evolved. That's your creation out there. Your crime. BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force. And you thought you'd be able to hide it? Who would ever suspect that? Who would ever remember? I remember. NADIA rubs the glass with her hand, squinting into the darkness. The time-code display rolls faster, decades in"

virtuosity,PARKER ,Denzel Washington,"  Five years can be a bitch, huh?  Where's John? Recital's over, asshole. SHIT!  SOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING!  He...only had a year left on his sentence.  Why'd.. .you pull me out? He was a computer program for crissake. Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?  I'm getting by.  You want to know how I'm doing? Every day, I lose a little bit more of myself.  I'm becoming something else, and it scares the hell out of me.  But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.  You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?  Do me a favor  keep sending them. OW! It'll never feel right. Sometimes. You actually listen to all those tapes? A little less than yesterday. John died. You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you. If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence. Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more. Go to hell. Enough! I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.  You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.  It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee? Only because I got pulled out early. I've seen worse.  Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?  Not from in here. What happens if I can't catch him? How do you know I won't run?  I don't need a babysitter. What she's going to do is get in my way. She wasn't part of the deal, Cox. Their weapons missing? Where's my gun?  Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie. Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.  Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar. Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody. Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene. Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends. I know who would know. Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file? What happened when he was 17? Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.  Bang... What are you doing? You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?  Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him... I'm surprised you didn't write one about me. I've been in prison, remember? Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...  ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.  For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?  Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts. This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you. Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality? What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else. Can you tell us what's on the disc? You should see what he's been up to recently. I'll wait out here. Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone. Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere. Sometimes, I like being part machine. Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?  She's beautiful, you know? Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house? You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to? What does that mean? Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next. Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee. I forgot what real coffee tastes like... Don't worry about it, all right? Relax. I know what you meant. Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while? I'll meet you there. Stop me. This is my area of expertise. Nothing. Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it? You know I am.  Tell him.  Call me whatever you want, asshole. The only thing I want to hear is your silence.  You and me have nothing in common.  Enough with your pulse already.  Still got your gun? Show me you can use it. Nail the fucker. Any time now... What's the problem? In English, please.  It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying. Start of what? You like baseball? This is Officer Parker Barnes. Get every able body you can to Dodger Stadium -- J Section.  Live execution. Real effective security... Authority still makes me nervous. Both.  Everybody get down!  GET DOWN!!!  Sid's getting away.  If you're gonna do it, better do it now.  I lost him...  That's Grimes... The man who killed my wife...who killed my daughter...who ruined my life used to taunt me with that line...  Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!  But he's in there. And you knew it, didn't you? Didn't you?!  God, you fucking know-it-all! You've known all along and didn't tell me! Why?! Were you afraid I'd lose it?! Go over the edge?! Huh?! Is that what you were afraid of?! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME??!!! What the hell's going on?! You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!! GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD! DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? Shit! They're going to fry me for it, anyway. You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How? You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?  Then I guess we're even. Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him. I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?  When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head? If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself. I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious. Part of him is. Think he's keeping track of his creation? See something? Nice work. Why's that? NOOOOOO!  Don't worry, I know. I know. What C-4...was Cox talking about? Where did you plant the C-4?! A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.  You mean there's something you haven't asked me? You don't know? Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7. What C-4...was Cox talking about? Where did you plant the C-4?!  You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!  Don't move, and don't make a sound. Got it? I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?  You are going after Mayor Bennett. Aren't you going to watch with me? What are you talking about?  Madison, get me out of here! MADISON! MADISON!!! SOMEBODY HELP!  ...I think so...You? Lindenmeyer? Sid?  Elizabeth Deane, please. Tell her it's Parker Barnes... Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been? Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards. No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing? If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.  Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena. You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to. Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?  You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.  I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else. Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer. Where the hell are you going? Listen to me, a bomb is planted somewhere in the Hollywood Bowl! Evacuate everybody! Then put somebody on who does! You've got to stop the concert! A bomb is going to go off!  Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again. Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend? How's your pulse? Then shoot him already. You won't want to watch. Turn around. Mind if I borrow a couple of your tools for a second? Care to join me?"
heat,NEIL ,Robert De Niro,"  You ready if I need you?  Got their air? Turn it off. Two minutes, fifty seconds.  We ought to be down the chute into the escape route in 2:20.  Here we go...  Next one blows you up!    Out! Now...  Now! Up against the wall!  8o seconds left.    Move it. Move out!  38 seconds left!  Ten. Nine. (tosses the watch; into walkie-talkie to Towner) Blew the margin. Here we come.  Here we come. I don't want to talk about it. What's the matter?  ""Malibu Securities ... No. So what? Try it on. By reputation. What do I need look at his score for? I got my own.  9:00a.M. tomorrow.  This is a partial   split, but I took out of ours   - every - to make up...  ...his full end.    Because I want to settle him up   and get rid of this jagoff right   now.  Fuck off.  Electricity and chemicals a little fucked up?  You a shooter? Speed? What?  You didn't have to. Now we got extra heat off a clean score.  No thanks.  You closing in a few minutes?  No.  It's the color reproduction of these plates... Sure. You're open late.       Not many open this late.  What's your name?  Bukowski. Neil Bukowski.  Swimming pools. Institutional. Schools, State, counties. I'm on the sales end.  Let me have another coffee.  You like selling books? Yeah?   Like what?  Tell me. What else? City of lights. I flew over the arctic once at 40,000 feet. The moonlight was blue on all the snow. It felt like that. Yeah. I'm alone.    Not lonely.  You? What is it? You want a $100,000 advance, against a full 101. Why? On the prowl or strong? How many guys? That's not a $100,000 worth anything. You're giving me an address to what's strictly a cowboy score: ""Get the guns and let's go!"" We smash, grab and boogie while they hit the alarm. Do I have to kill people? Full architectural, plumbing and electric, camera placements? What do you estimate? He hadda make a call.  You're on.  Here's five grand earnest money. You get the rest after lunch. I bought it. The bonds? How is he?  Chris is here. I called so you shouldn't worry. What's wrong?  He can sleep it off here. What happened to you? When I get around to it.  Why? With everything we been taking? When I get around to it. You got something else on the side?  She got another man?  You sure? Jimmy - whatsisname - Bohunk, in the joint used to say: ""On the street you wanna be makin' roves, you don't put anything in your life you can't walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot heat around the corner."" So? Taking delivery from Van Zant on the rest of the armored car cash. I gotta drop a deposit on Kelso. He's got a bank score. That goes, too. Meet me at the coffee shop at noon. I got stuff to do... How you doing?  I been real busy.  Can I see you?  Not for me it wasn't.  Tonight. I'll pick you up at work.  Change for a dollar?  Yeah. Van Zant.  About the merchandise.    What's the story?  333-6089. Open up. Who was that guy? Listen...  We got to know who he is! What he tell you? How connected he is? Get you a spot in a show? Chris is gonna straighten it up with you. And you ... I'm not part of your situation!  Not anymore. And Chris has got two big jobs back-to-bick. You will give Chris this shot.  After that, he fucks up, then okay.  I will finance setting you up, separate, myself. Dominick will go with you. And my word counts. But right now he is puttin' it all on the line. So for the three of you, you are goin', to give Chris one more shot.  Now that is what it is gonna be You keep your hands in sight! I tell you what to do, how to do it. Now, with your right hand only: throw the envelope in my back seat. You're all done, pal. John Van Zant? Neil McCauley.  Tell you what: keep the money.  ""... keep ... the ... money.""  What am I doin' I'm talking into an empty telephone.  'Cause there is a dead man on the other end of this line...  You got a clean line? I got a delay dropping the $50,000.  Wait a minute, pal-o!!  You're going to wait for me for a week. I'll buy a week with the five. It's above and beyond the fifty and if I wash, you keep it.  You're going to wait for me 'cause you want me to take it down. You know it's got better odds with me in.  Now do we have an understanding?  We'll down platinum through Nate. The deal is 72% of today's quote on the Bourse in the New York Times.  We pass by couple times tomorrow afternoon. Check nothing strange in the neighborhood. Tomorrow night: we take it down. You set on the rear door.  Kill him...after the score.  We'll use Nate's advance off the platinum when I down the merch to pay Kelso for the bank package.  I got it.  Come away with me. New Zealand. Soon. What's stopping you?     What's here? What's to know?  Why? I deal with state officials. County. Weird hours. A lot of traveling, entertaining. I know enough. I have to leave. Come away with me.  No one will ever tell you what to do... You'll never lose yourself with me.  ...We walk.  It is not an animal sound.   We are out of here.  We walk!! Now. LAPD? The G? What? Where the hell did this heat come from?  Wake up!  Assume they got our phones, our houses bugged, I beepers on all the cars. We got major problems.. Where's Cerrito? Recognize the cook? D Block. San Q. Did a nickel on armed robbery. Hey, David.     How you doing?  Gettin' by. You okay? Sure.   See you around.  What took you so long? I cash in T-bills to pay-off Kelso. That's not our problem. With the heat we got, you wanna play World War Two in the streets with Van Zant? Fuck Van Zant. I got more motivation to whack him than you do. He is a luxury. Our problem is: jam and take the bank or split.  And I mean right fucking now. Do not go home, pack, nothing. Thirty seconds from now we are on the road. Gone. Michael?  Not on this one, Michael. On this one you make up your own mind. I got some plans. To go away after. So for me, it's worth the stretch.  But, Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away. T. Bonds; real estate. If I were you, I'd be smart and cut loose of this. All right.   All right. Yeah. You see how the road leads back around? That's the escape route...  There's enough circuit diagrams and blueprints here to build the bank.  It's terrific. I've had heat before. This one's worth the stretch I'm sure.   Drop me at the garage.  Sure. Buy me a cup of coffee. Yeah. You looking to become a penologist? You must have worked some dipshit crews.  You see me doing thrill-seeker liquor store holdups with a ""Born to Lose"" tattoo on my chest? Right.   And I...  I am never going back. I do what I do best. I take scores. You do what you do best trying to stop guys like me. What the fuck is that?    Barbecues and ballgames? That's nice.     That your life? A man told me once: you want to make moves? Don't keep anything in your life you're not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.  So if you're chasing me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a family? No.  I got a woman. She thinks I sell swimming pools. That's the discipline. Yeah?  Then maybe you and me, we should both go do somethin' else, pal.  ...neither do I. Neither do I. There's a flip side to that coin. What if you got me boxed in and I gotta put you down?  'Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way.  But now that we been face to face, I would not feel good about that. But I won't hesitate. Not for one second. ...maybe we'll never see each other again.  Got it. it's eighteen inches in. Where the hell's Towner? I wanted to pass by early. I want to check the slot for the work car. What are you talking about? What the hell I do for a driver?! What do you call this?    Backing me up? Here comes your second chance for a change of luck... Need a driver. Remember the drill? To-day. Out back in five. There's the slot. No. 'Cause time is not a problem. And I want nothing to look weird. There is none.  Drop us in the slot.   Let's take it down. Hi!  Ladies and gentlemen!  We are holding up this bank.  We want to hurt nobody.  You do exactly like we say and you come away okay. We're here  for the bank's money, not your money... ...you people behind the windows: the salaries this bank pays aren't big enough to take risks for, so think of your take-home pay before you risk your life.  ...don't forget your money is insured by the Federal Government. You're not going to lose a penny. Relax and you'll get through this okay.  Any of the ladies feel ill or anybody with heart trouble wants to sit down, go right ahead.  The key. Don't touch your face.   Let it bleed.  Go!! Go!!  What's the bottom line? Six, seven hours.   What do I owe you? What is this? You're wrong. It's four times the risk. 'Cause something happens to him, I'm coming back for you. And I'm double the worst trouble you ever had. I'll be back for you. First, I got to know if our escape route got ratted-out along with everything else. Who wasn't around Towner. Who?  She's dead...  So's Cerrito and Breedan...the guy who stood in...for you.  Who did this...?  Who? Waingro?    On his own? Van Zant?  You sure? You say anything about our exit? Our out? C ' mon!  The house clean?  I'll call the medics.  ...Nate.  No.  Next: Waingro. Okay?  I'll make time.  I need a new ""out"" laid on.  How can I trust it?  Things are screwed up. You're not flying out after me. We go together. You and me got to straighten something up first. I'll be by later. Waingro.   Where is he? How much? That's a rip-off. What do I get for those dollars? Via what? Reliable? A girl. With her own papers.  What are these good for? How soon? Make it twelve. You checked all around? Where's the pick-up? Kelso's share. Ten per cent. $400,000. That's less the 50 advance. The other bag was with Cerrito. It's what I don't do.  I don't sell swimming pools. It would have been okay. You would have flown out after. You didn't need to do a thing. Now I'm jammed. We got to go together. Because we get dropped in a place and then I decide: New Zealand or Brazil or Tunisia, whatever. I can't leave a string back here to where I am. I rob and steal for a living. Do you understand? If they got in the way.    Yes. It's their problem. Elaine Cerrito.  Michael Cerrito's wife. Michael was my friend. He knew the risks. He didn't have to be there. He coulda been a...been a mailman. Believe it.  Eady. Get packed.     Get dressed. Let's go.  Eady! ! Shut up!  Use these credit cards. They say ""Mr. and Mrs."" I reserved the car. Buy me some clothes. Here's a list. I can't go home for my stuff. Can you do it? Twenty-two hours. Then we fly out of here...clean. You can go now. There's the door, you want out... It will be different... I been trying. Use the Camaro. Its clean and will stand a DMV check. Someone's picking me up.  See you, cowboy. Any trouble? Six hours. 8 p.m.  I'll buy you lunch. Everything's smooth. We're going to fly away...  Hi ya.  Yeah, Breedan's end?  Okay...  You figured right.  Take it easy, old man.  That was the last bridge. Look over there.  I don't even know how to think like this...cause this has happened to me late in my life. But I got some expectations. For us. You can walk right now if you want. Walk away. Or you...on your own...you choose to come with me. I got enough in there to take care of us for forever.  Eady.  Eady?  Nothing. I got this errand to run that I forgot.  Sure. It's a thing I got to take care of... is all.  Leave it running. ...be right back, Eady.  Hi. It's the kitchen again. A... ""Jamieson"" ordered a BLT and they got his room number screwed up.  Thanks, love. I'm hotel security. We're evacuating the floor. Sir, I'm afraid you'll have to. I should have dumped you in that parking lot. Look at me, you sick fuck.  Gimme your eyes. 'Cause you're gonna die. ...not half bad."
blow,GEORGE ,Johnny Depp," I was standing there, and it was like the outside of me and the inside of me didn't match, you know?  And then I looked around the room and it hit me.  I saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna live, what type of car I'd drive, who my neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I didn't want it.  Not that life. There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it. I know. No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want... I'm going to California. California was like nothing I'd ever experienced.  The people were liberated and independent and full of new ideas. They used words like ""right on,"" ""groovy,"" and ""solid.""  The women are all beautiful and seemed to share the same occupation. Figured what out? It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this? Are you sure this guy is cool? Nothing like this back home. George. We want some grass. No. We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop? What the fuck is that? We'll take it. This is it for me. Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right. Yeah.  I am. I was standing there, and it was like the outside of me and the inside of me didn't match, you know?  And then I looked around the room and it hit me.  I saw my whole life.

Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right. Yeah.  I am. Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here? Yeah, but what are you doing out here? This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors? Right on. Stoned? Yeah? Yeah? The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag. Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight. I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell. Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound. It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting. Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear. Barbara and me.  No one else. She's a flight attendant.  They don't check her bags. It's not enough. The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled. So, we need to get to the source. He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him. Who speaks Spanish? You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode. We're not gonna get busted. Yes, I am. Very nice.  I'll take it. All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane. I don't need a little.  I need a lot. What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns? It's fine.  We're not stealing it. We're borrowing it.  And try to look natural.  We've got company. Be cool. Alright, pull back the throttle... Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing? Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it. So I brought you sixty. Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone? Should we buy it? We'll take it. Well, you know.  It's um... Yeah, layaway. Honey, your nose! You wanna split? Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check. Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale. I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments. No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest. Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself. Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that. I had a little problem in Chicago. Something about trying to sell a truckload of dope to an undercover officer.  So I applied the three rules of the game under if and when arrested. Rule one: don't fight.  A trial will cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and the jury will chop off your balls and hand them to you on a platter. Rule two: plead not guilty and get bailed out of jail. Your honor, I'd like to say a few words to the court. In all honesty, I don't feel like what I've done is a crime and I think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison.  None of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars.  I mean, when you think about it, what did I really do?  Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief, but where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief? Baby, you didn't have to come. Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two. What?  You're not going to wait for me? Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off. Time is such a funny thing.  I look at where I am now, and in here, time inches along.  So slow, it hardly seems like it moves.  But back then, time went fast. It went too fast. Hi, Mom. Surprised to see me? Mexico. Barbara. Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you? Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad? May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face... Just low. Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do? You mad at me? Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me. I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great. What? I don't want to talk about it. Not really, no. I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego. Murder. What do you got there, Diego? What kind of project? I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything. Twenty-six months. I've got to get out of here, Diego. What's the other one? Alright, let's open our books. Alright.  You're right.  I want to get out of this shithole as fast as I can. And I don't want to do this any more than you do.  But for me to walk early, some of you have to graduate.  You, forget about it.  You're hopeless, go to sleep. But the rest of you could get diplomas and get jobs when you're on the outside. We can learn some criminal shit, too. Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if half the time, we learn about George Washington, and the other half, I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs? I was arrested in Chicago with six hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I think that qualifies me. Flew it in from Mexico on a single engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal or not? Alright, the first thing you need to know about smuggling drugs is that it's easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers. They couldn't find their dicks in a whorehouse.  They don't know what the fuck they're doing... I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed. Good night. I would if I could get some sleep. Because I got caught. Because they caught me? I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive. That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo. Oh my G-d. Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ. Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get? Four passenger, single engine Cessna. I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami? We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there. Diego Delgado, please? Diego?  It's George. Yeah, I'm out. How are we doing? Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you? I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state. I just got released five minutes ago. Good to see you, Diego. Okay. What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs. What?  Yeah, sure. My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter? What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes. It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos. You're a fucking amateur! When you're carrying drugs across the border, the idea is to remain calm.  The way I do it is to think of something pleasant, a fun party, a moment of triumph.  A sexual encounter.  I actually project myself to that place. Anything to keep your mind off the fact that you're going to jail for a very long time if they find the fifteen kilos of cocaine in your suitcases. Yes.  My brother's wedding.  Imagine that, huh? Mine. What can I tell you?  Different strokes. We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic. Excuse me? I see.  How much? Gee, Jack, a million each had such a nice ring to it. You good with this? Alright. What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit. It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed. And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we? What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me. I'm George.  Friend of Diego's? I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George. Um-hmm. Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money. Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on... Hi, Mom. I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get your ass up here. What did I tell you? Sell it? Just sell it, Derek. I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek. But to the victor belong the spoils. Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians. Not bad for a weekend's work, huh? Where do you guys want to count? What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on? What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail? Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking. Just a friend. Yeah.  You do the talking. Actually, it was three. It would be my pleasure. Un sapo? Yes. With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him. Yes, it is. Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me. It's beautiful. What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know. I want money. Freedom. Yeah, maybe. Sure. Keep them coming. Money. Diego is my brother. Three million.  I counted it twice. I'm calling it three. Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again. I don't give a shit.  Close enough. Where do I put this!? There's no room. We've got to do something about this. Are you comfortable with this? And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks. I love it. I give you thirty-million dollars and you give me this little book. You're a lucky man, Diego. I love you too, man. I'll be right back, Diego. Hello. Do I know you? Why are you smiling? I don't know.  My name is George. What is your name? Mirtha. My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you. Sky's the limit.  We're just beginning to tap the market.  If it's accepted by actors and musicians, the rest will follow. I think Padroni is happy with the current situation.  Will you please excuse me? I like fire. Jesus Christ. Put that shit away, they're here.  It's a family heirloom. Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family. So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments... Dad. Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now. Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate. What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it? Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy. No no no... no problema, amigo.  El dinero esta todo aqui. Lleves las ""llaves"" y mas tarde lo contaremos.  Okay?  No problem. Nothing.  Todo esta bien. This is not the time, Diego. Fuck you...I didn't fuck you. Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys. Take 'em and go. Take it easy!  Everything's okay! Take the fucking keys! Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now. No problem, gentlemen.  Goodbye. Derek Foreal. Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now? Yeah, well where is he?  And who is this Norman K. guy?  That's all anyone is talking about.  Norman K.  Norman K.  Do I know him? What? Motherfucker works fast. He what? That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing? Oh, no. Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I wearing lipstick? I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because when I'm getting fucked, I want to make sure my face is pretty.  You're buying directly from Diego, aren't you, you son of a bitch? Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you. I bring you in, and this is how you repay me?  You little homo!  Hey, Derek? Derek? No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo. No more brothers, Diego. You fucked me, Diego. You went behind my back and you cut me out. I talked to Foreal, Diego. You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man. Yeah, well... Yeah. I didn't come here to drink scotch. You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk. You're saying life will take care of Diego? I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up! Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good? Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out. Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now. Coming! Watching my baby girl born did something to me. They talk about religious experiences, I didn't believe in religion.  But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this world, something in me changed.  I looked at her and I knew right then that I could never love anything but my daughter ever again.  It sounds sappy, but it was like, click, I knew what I was put on this planet for.  It was the greatest feeling I ever had followed by the worst feeling I ever had. Coke. I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams. Today. Come on.  Come on, honey.  You can do it.  Come to Daddy. Good girl! Look, Mirtha.  She's walking. No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her. But this is... Alright. Where are you going? Yeah.  She told me. I heard. It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too. For calling you a homo. Good to see you, Derek. I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring. No, that's alright. No honey, I'm alright. What's this? I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound. Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing. Oh hey, one more thing? Get me a six pack. Fuck. Hi. Mom. Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile. No. Give this to Mom, will you? Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy. Tell Mom, you know... I'd like to make a withdrawal. Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something. Not in front of the kid. Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset. I don't know. No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I? There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya. Hey, why don't you just put a ""I'm doing cocaine"" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem? What? Those are my nuts! What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here. My baby.  She's so big. Hello, Derek?  It's George.  Yeah. Yeah, I am.  I'm in Miami.  I'm looking to do something.  I want to put together a crew.  Do you know anybody?  Leon?  I don't know him.  What's his last name? Alright.  Give me the number. Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you. How are you doing? Dad. You can call me Dad if you want. Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on... Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again. Who's the co-pilot? Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody. Holy shit, Dulli! That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed. No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do. Five-thousand per kilo. This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think? Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go? Yeah, sure, whatever. California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California? What is it?  A Disneyland thing? California, huh? Go on inside now.  I want to talk to your mom alone. I'll be here. You knew I was seeing Kristina, right? Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know? Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going. Yeah, you will.  Of course. Yeah. I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then. Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good. Where are you coming in? No.  All set.  Piece of cake. I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me? I don't know.  Maybe California. Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school. You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags. There's schools in California. That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date. I swear.  On my life. I swear on your life. Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance. You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen. I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers. Yeah!  Unbelievable.  Dulli, pour us another round.  I gotta hit the head.  Dulli, I was just thinking about that time we landed in Mexico.  You've gotten a lot better since then, huh pal? Remember that fucking landing strip? Huh? Hey, what's wrong fellas?  Why the long faces?  No.  C'mon, Dulli. Oh, no. I was busted.  Set up by the FBI and the DEA.  That didn't bother me.  Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal to save their own asses.  That didn't bother me. Sentenced to sixty years at Otisville. That didn't bother me. I had broken a promise.  Everything I loved in my life goes away. How's he doing? Right. Hello, Dad... You know, I remember a lifetime ago, I was about three-and-a-half feet tall, weighing all of sixty-pounds, every inch your son... ...those Saturday mornings going to work with my Dad.  We'd climb into that big yellow truck.  I used to think it was the biggest truck in the world. I remember how important the job we did was. How if it weren't for us, people would freeze to death.  I thought you were the strongest man in the world. Remember those home movies when Mom would dress up like Loretta Young?  And the ice creams and the football games? Waino, the Tuna, and the day I left for California only to come home with the FBI chasing me? And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said... That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that? And that time you told me that money wasn't real?  Well, old man, I'm forty two years old.  I finally learned what you tried to tell me so many years ago. I finally understand.  You're the best, Dad.  I just wish I could have done more for you.  I wish we had more time. I guess I kind of lost sight of things. ""May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.""  Love, George. I meant every word of it. Yeah, Dad.  I knew that. What do you guys want? What about him? What the fuck?  Is he going to walk? I don't think so. No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat. Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina? Is she here?  Is she coming? Yeah. He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do? Mirtha, how are you doing? Hey, Arch, you think the judge will let us get a cocktail after this is all over? Thanks, Arch. I'm George Jung.  Spelled J-U-N-G. Yes, I do. Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table. Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America... The first run was fifteen kilos, which we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard shelled suitcases. We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way if there were any dogs in customs... I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of cocaine per week into the United States via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly into North Carolina, we'd meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points... I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego Delgado was my only connection to cocaine from Colombia... Diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a close relationship with Manuel Noriega. In exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid him a percentage. There was an 85% chance that if you snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it was ours. Initially with my LA connections, we invented the marketplace.  In 1977, there was no other real competition. The first year we made about 100 million dollars between us.  It was an expensive operation.  Eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections on both coasts, everything was running smooth. We were like a corporation... he was very anti-government.  He talked about revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power as well as money.  I was just looking for money. He disliked the United States, thought it was a police state.  He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country. Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my connection, I met him back in 1968 when I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It was Foreal's marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market. Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only a matter of months before he'd cut me out. I'm not sure how my relationship with my daughter and ex-wife have anything to do with this trial.  I mean we're here to talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we? Yes, I am. No, I cam here out of my own volition. Something about vengance being best served cold. Excuse me? I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen. You shouldn't have taken the 30 million, Diego, I was out. I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to... I fucked up. I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know. After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you. But I have a visitor. But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter. Because she's visiting me."
armageddon,Golden ,,"  We got the top scientific minds in the world working on  this.  Try ""whacking"" the thing.  I am secure. Go ahead, General.  Fly a team up to New York. Contact every Space Watch  facility in the world. We gotta find what part of the sky this is coming from.  In it's simplest terms? The end of Mankind. One asteroid, one mile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force of all the  nuclear weapons in the  world, times a thousand. Half our population will die within 24  hours from tidal waves and heat pulses. The other half won't be so lucky. In the  end, it will be men  eating the flesh of other men.  It's not the end of the  world, General, the world - Earth - will still be here. But there will be no  life - maybe cockroaches and  some resilient strands of bacteria.  With the worst guidance system in the world. Their Mars Probe in '96 was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa.  Their launch date is set for next month.  To when?  What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it together? Even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear detonation is not  going to work.  The only way is to split the thing in half and hope the two pieces  slide past us.  Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing to do unless you have the exact co-ordinates. There are only twelve telescopes  powerful enough  to see it right now. You've got a full moon goin' for four days -  makes it all but impossible to see.. Once these things draw closer to Earth, you'll never keep a lid on  this. No way.  Harry. Let's figure this out.  Okay, who?  Go.  How's she look?  Negative, A.J. Don't exceed ix thousand. Not on this run.  Negative, A.J. A.J. increases the RPM's. The gauge starts to rise. The N.A.S.A. Brass shifts  uneasily in their seats. They're not accoutomed to seeing their astronauts  disobey orders.nan  ""Don't tell me what you can't do, tell me what you can."" Remember that, Stamper? Go faster.  What is going on up there?  Firmly.  IF you're gonna pull this off, we have to have a little talk about time...and temperature. Zero Barrier's in two hours.  Harry, your suits are good upto 150 degrees Celsius....  We didn't anticipate you being on the asteroid so long. The clock is ticking...  Three hundred and fifty degrees.  Go ahead, Harry."
avatar,JAKE ,Sam Worthington," They can fix a spinal, if you've got the money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy. I became a Marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life. I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass. Let's get it straight up front. I don't want your pity. I know the world's a cold-ass bitch. You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet. The strong prey on the weak. It's just the way things are.   And nobody does a damn thing. All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for. CUT TO: I hope you realize you've just lost a customer!  Candy ass bitch. If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'! Step off.    You're ruinin' my good mood. The strong prey on the weak. A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet. Jesus, Tommy. The Suits' concern was touching. The egghead and the jarhead.   Tommy was the scientist, not me. He was the one who wanted to get shot light years out into space to find the answers. Me -- I was just another dumb grunt gettin' sent someplace I was gonna regret.  Are we there? What're you two limpdicks starin' at? Nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease. CUT TO: Yeah. That's why I'm here. Damn.   They got big. It looks like him. The idea is -- every driver is matched to his own avatar -- -- so their nervous systems are in tune. Or something. Which is why they offered me this gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar, which was insanely expensive.  Is this right? I just say whatever in these videologs? Right.  So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.  Never been in a lab before. He's dead. I know it's a big inconvenience to everyone. No. High school chemistry.   But I ditched. Like -- an hour. Don't!   I got this. Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling me what I couldn't do. Kiss the darkest part of my lily white -- Grace? That's kinda freaky. You guys're packing some heavy ordinance. Yeah, no problem. I figured -- just another hellhole.  That sounds real good, Colonel.   So -- am I still with Augustine? Just Marines comparin' tattoos. Got it. Then how's this supposed to work? How do we contact them? Or they may skin us and make a drum.  What happened here? It's already pissed off! What do I do? Oh yeah!   Who's bad?! That's right. That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch! That's right motherf-- What about this one?       Run, don't run? What?  I don't have all goddamn night! Come on! Come on! Wait, don't -- Look, um, I know you probably don't understand this. But -- thanks. Thank you. I owe you. I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along -- Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'? Slow down a second will you. I just want to thank you for killing those -- Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm sorry. They attacked me.   How'm I the bad guy HERE-- Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? What's the thinking? Yes, why save me? If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should teach me. Whooaa. Then teach me to ""see."" Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off on the wrong foot and -- --you just have to get to know me. I'm Jake. Jake Sull-- Whooaaa -- shit! I need your help. So take me with you.  What? What are they? What was that all about? What's your name? What's going on? Your father!?  Uh, good to meet you, sir. Who's Eywa? Jake Sully. I came to learn. My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist. I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a warrior. Of the Jarhead clan. What's going on?   What are they saying? So it's all good, right?   You and me -- Don't get up. You never told me your name. Okay, again, a whole lot slower. Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree. Your mom likes me.    I can tell. These rock. What are they? That's some damn fine teylu. That's like grandma's teylu. Wha --? Oh.  Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to believe where I am. CUT TO: It's not something you can teach.  Yeah. They want to study me.   See if I can learn to be one of them.  Does Augustine know about this? So -- who talks them into moving? What if they won't go? I'm on it. CUT TO: Tsu'tey.  Mo'at.  Eytukan. Got it. So who's this Eywa? Who's got a date with the chief's daughter? I didn't meet the sister. Forward.  I knew this guy could speak English. You've got outer columns, then a secondary ring here, and an inner ring. Then a core structure, it's like a spiral, that's how they move up and down. Roger that. Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace explained it to me -- some kind of maglev effect because unobtanium is a superconductor, or something. At least somebody understands it. Just not me. CUT TO: Hey. You got a problem? Holy shit. When? Do I have to do this?   I need some rack. Yeah, yeah.  The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon. Repetition. Seyri. Ontu, mikyun, nari. Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard. Norm's attitude has improved lately. Ireiyo. It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a retard too. My feet are getting tougher.   I can run farther every day. I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die. I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning. I'm learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds. Sometimes I have no idea what she's talking about. It's been a month and I'm still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasn't given permission. There's a lot of crap like that. She's always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not --  I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on the final. Excuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay? Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.  I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People. I made a kill today. We ate it.   I know where that meal came from. Yeah yeah. Get rid of this shit, then you can lecture me. Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya. That's right, Grace. This is what I've been working for. What did happen at the school? Jesus. Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven. It's the test every young hunter has to pass. We doin' this? How will I know if he chooses me? Outstanding. Let's dance. That's right! You're mine. Heeeyyyaaaah! Shut the hell up!! Level out!     Fly straight! I may not be much of a horse guy.   But I was born to do this. The People call it Toruk. Last one you ever see. That's it. Hey, guys. CUT TO: That's a long time. Sorry. It's hard to put in words the deep connection the People have to the forest. They see a network of energy that flows through all living things. They know that all energy is only borrowed-- -- and one day you have to give it back. Hard to believe it's only been three months.  I can barely remember my old life. I'm not sure who I am anymore. CUT TO: You called us back to report -- you want to hear it or not? No.    I can do this. I've gotta finish this thing. There's one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm one of them. They'll trust what I say... ... and I can negotiate the terms of their relocation. It's the last door -- I'm going through it. You can help me or get out of the way. I have to go all the way -- become one of THEM-- You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch sent me. That's right -- to embed with the Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them out of their home. By deceit or by force, he didn't care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it. I'm not that guy any more. But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me out -- I never see her again. And if I tell her the truth, the clan throws me out -- that's if they don't cut my heart out and show it to me. They don't even have a word for ""lie"" -- they had to learn it from us.  Grace. I've gotta go.   They're waiting.  It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the Dream Hunt anyway. It's like -- a sound you feel. I don't want Ninat. I've already chosen. But this woman must also choose me. Neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping. We are? Really, we are? It's cool. I'm there. Hey!    Heeeey! Stop! Stop!  Okay, listen. There's something I have to tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just need you to -- I accept. CUT TO: It's the only way to get him to goddamn listen. Are you out of your goddamn mind?!  You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her. Just tell him what you know in your heart. They're not going to give up their home -- they're not gonna make a deal. For what? Lite beer and shopping channel? There's nothing we have that they want. We're a horror to them. We're the monsters from space. They're never going to leave Hometree. Yup. That's how it's done. When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it. When? Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind of blood on your hands. Let me try to talk them out. They trust me.  Eytukan, I have something to say, to everyone.  A great evil is upon us. The Sky People are coming to destroy Hometree. They will be here soon.  You have to leave, or you will die. They sent me here to learn your ways. So one day I could bring this message, and you would believe it. Yes.  At first it was just orders. Then everything changed. I fell in love-- with the forest, with the Omaticaya People --  -- with you. And by then, how could I tell you? Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to -- You have to get out of Hometree! Run to the forest! Please, I'm begging you! We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the columns. Neytiri!   Neytiri! I'm sorry -- I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up...  Thanks. So what do you say?    Time for a revolution? Come on. CUT TO:  Get your ship fired up. Stay here. I need somebody on the inside I can trust. Take it nice and easy, troop. On the ground, face down. Hands behind your head. Go! Go! Go! Oh yeah, baby! Hang on, Grace. CUT TO: It's strongest at the Well of Souls, right? Good, `cause that's where we're going. I'm gonna get you some help, Grace. No!   The People can help you. I know it. CUT TO: The Well of Souls. The heart of the forest. I knew the People would go there. I've gotta try, Norm. Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them again, I was gonna have to change the rules. Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move. Come on, boy. Time to fly. The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up? But that was just a theory.  I See you.  Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I stand before you, ready to serve the People.  You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best warrior. I can't do this without you. Ireiyo. Grace is dying.     I beg the help of the Great Mother. Look where we are, Grace. Is that possible? Hang on, they're gonna fix you up. I will. Grace! With your permission, I will Speak now. You would honor me by translating. The Sky People have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this is our land! We rode out to the four winds. To the horse clans of the plain, to the ikran people of the mountains. When Toruk Macto called them, they came. Talk fast.  Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way. When? Thanks. That's right. Because I gave it to him on a plate. Then I guess we better stop him. Gonna have to settle for coffee. CUT TO: I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. But there was only one thing I was ever really good at. Ooh-rah.  Strike here and here. Yeah. What's your point? I've never done this in my life. And I'm probably just talking to a tree right now. But if you're there -- I need to give you a heads up. If Grace is there with you -- look in her memories -- she can show you the world we come from. There's no green there. They killed their Mother, and they're gonna do the same thing here. More Sky People are gonna come. They're gonna come like a rain that never ends -- -- until they've covered the world. Unless we stop them. Look, you chose me for somethin'. And I'll stand and fight, you know I will. But I could use a little help here. It was worth a try. We have to stop the shuttles, no matter what it takes. What the hell -- ? WHOO-HOOOO!  Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him, anybody that can! Do it now! It's all over Quaritch -- Kinda hoped you'd say that. I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan. They're safe. No. I'm not officer material. I'm not killing you. No.  Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the Mother Spirit. A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen. The forest will heal, and so will the hearts of the People. New life keeps the energy flowing, like the breath of the world. This is my last videolog. The science guys will keep the lights on, here. But I won't miss this place. I better wrap this up. There's a funeral tonight, and I don't want to be late. It was someone very close to me."
rush,JAMES ,Chris Hemsworth," I think the racetrack telephoned ahead that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..? What's the matter? No one seen a spot of blood before? Absolutely fine. I have. If you call a friendly disagreement with another driver an accident. None of your business. Ouch. His wife. It was a nasty blow. Done with a bloody spanner. Nothing! Only what she begged me to do. Be happy to show you if you like. I have a theory why women like racing drivers. It's not because they respect what we do...driving round and round in circles. Mostly they think that's pathetic. And they're probably right..  It's our closeness to death. The closer you are to death, the more alive you FEEL...the more alive you ARE. And they can see that in you. FEEL that in you. The way you live. Willing to risk everything. With no thought for tomorrow...as if each day is your last. It's a wonderful way to live...and the ONLY way to drive. The only way to get that tenth of a second on everyone else... To dare to be one step bolder...one step faster... Sure one step closer to death... But one step closer to victory, too... You still haven't. This is Formula 3. A lower division. Where people like me mess about in the hope of finding sponsors or being talent-spotted to race in Formula 1. Everyone, this is Nursie. Nursie, this is Doc our designer... Bubbles, our chief mechanic. Le Patron - Alexander, Lord Hesketh. Trust me. Nursie's anything BUT a bore.. Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh. There's a lie that all drivers tell themselves. ""Death is something that happens to other people."" That's how you find the courage to get in the car in the first place... Never better, Patron. Because bad things only happen to others, right? Problem is deep down you know that's a lie. That it could happen to you at any moment. So how do you make that terror go away? Well, booze is good for that. And wacky baccy. But better than everything else is...sex. Who's that? Is there a difference? All bloody Goosesteppers. You mean the one you spun out of? And finished facing the other way? I think that corner had you. But we didn't, did we? Thanks to your impeccable `survival' instincts... Jawohl. Remember ze name. Very simple. ""Hunt"". It rhymes with.... ...a word that happens to describe you perfectly. No one. Chippy little Kraut. Bad loser. Forget him. Thank you. My parents always wanted me to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and gave me a first class education...but to no avail. My brothers are the success stories. I get bored easily. I have a hot head, an inability to tolerate discipline. I fall out with people left and right. I'm quick to settle matters with my fists. The only creatures I've ever loved and treated well, are budgerigars. In any normal area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total liability. All I've got going for me is I'm quick in a car. So thank you for acknowledging that. And giving me this...  I'm going to give it to my Dad, and tell him to put it on the mantle-piece and imagine it's a first class degree in medicine. You don't think I'm ready now? Is that what he called us? What? How? He never won a thing! Not a single bloody race. A hundred and fifty grand? That's either an act of utter lunacy, or the ballsiest thing I ever heard. She is a beauty. But...haven't you made a mistake? That's not a Formula 2 car. She's F1. Are you serious? Well done the Goosestepper!! I do, Patron. So when do we start? I'm ready now. They should cancel the race. Is that right? So says the nobody who had to pay for his own drive. How's that working out, by the way? Not planning on being there for long. `Be happy to. I'll have you inside lap one. Asshole. Niki humiliated me today. He lapped me three times. That's supposed to console me? What do I need to do? Shut up, Moneyman. `Didn't ask you.. So speaks the jealous married man.. Don`t patronize me, Pete... And the good news is I've got Sigmund Freud Horsely, failed driver par excellence, and a washed-up accountant to lecture me on it. Bubbles? I'm sorry..! I didn't mean that! Come back..! ....along the Beau Rivage, long left into Massenet, into the short right of Casino. Sharp right into Mirabeau, then sharp left into Loews, mind the guard rails... He was. Then went to the house to take a call. He'll be back shortly. Why? No. Just a little coffin, surrounded by high-octane fuel, being driven round at 170 miles per hour..  To all intents and purposes a bomb. On wheels. No one wants it to be. It's like saying why not make bullfighting safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of death turns people on. Without it, I guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV, fine for everyone..  ...except us drivers. Yes. I know exactly. What was the description? By whom? Was. Not any more. New me very professional. Early to bed. Early to rise. All very dull. Round-the-clock work, practise and focus. Tedious, but apparently the only way to vin against ze Goosestepper.. Visualization techniques. Memorizing the circuit, in this case Monaco, which is next up. Eyes closed, know your way round in your sleep...  I know...I've always been a great believer in getting there on the day, putting the old foot down and playing chicken with everyone else. But they don't want me to do that anymore...they want my body like a temple. My mind like Monk. What does that mean? They want me to stop messing around, get married and settle down with the next nice girl I meet. They think it would be good for me. Sounds bloody awful. But since they're right about most things, they're probably right about that, too. You don't fancy getting married, do you? What's up? WHAT??? But that's the best team in the world. They could have ANYONE. Did he pay his way in there, too? Congratulations. Though with a car like that, the rest of us never stood a chance... You're still in a Ferrari. And I'm still in a Hesketh. On equal terms, the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat you, and you know it. Why's that? Now try saying that and tell me you're not jealous. Whom no one likes... Not even his own team-mates.. I did. In New York. Working. Right, whatever it takes to beat Lauda, just say it, your word is my command. I'll do it. There are no lengths to which I will not go. And I mean it this time... What's the matter? What are you doing? Where is everyone? November 14th. I'm assuming it refers to some animal you are allowed or no longer allowed to slaughter on your estate. So? We aren't looking for sponsorship. Condoms and cigarettes. Vulgar, right? What are you saying? Christ. I need a drive, Pete. Need you to find me a drive.  What does that mean? ""My reputation precedes me?""  Really? Is that what they said?  Did they at least say a ""Quick arsehole?""  Bollocks to Lotus. Find me someone else. I'll go mad otherwise. What were you hoping for? A well- adjusted knight in shining armour? Let me give you some advice. Don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving in circles looking for normality. Should have gone for one of my brothers. What's that? Tell me.. At least there's SOMETHING behind the facade. Fuck off to New York, dear. There must be a moisturizer or eye shadow somewhere that needs your vapid mush to flog it. Agreed. Repellent. Good girl... Hello? Who? McLaren? Just get me in a room with them, Pete. Say anything. Today? Yes, I can do today.  I can be there in an hour. I'm quicker than Jackie. What do you want? A driver or a brushes salesman? So do I. But I measure that in podium finishes and beating Niki Lauda not being a show pony for sponsors. I beat him in Formula 3. Only because I've been in the wrong car. I beat him when the playing field was level. I'd beat him again in a McLaren. It's the only car out there as good as the Ferrari. Which is why I'm here, begging. I'll do whatever you ask. Even put on a suit, talk to sponsors and say the right thing. I promise.  Just give me the drive... New car. Pole position. Level playing field now, my ratty little friend. My car wasn't right today. Next time I'll have you.. What did I tell you? Car fixed. Equal terms. You'd better get used to this. Five eighths of an inch..! What? You can't just `change it'. That means rebuilding the car. Who lodged the complaint? It was Ferrari, wasn't it? No! No! No! I can't stand it... What's happened? What have you DONE?? The car's evil! It's undriveable..! Fine! Just got a little problem with a bad loser rat and his team of Italian saboteurs who've destroyed my car. I won that race in Spain. And you know it. The aerofoil was five eighths of an inch too long!! Something that doesn't have the slightest effect on car speed. You complained. Now we've had to totally rebuild the car and it's become a monster. A car that was beating you week in week out, so you have to resort to this. Cheating. Is there something I should know about Suzy? Where is she? Wasn't she supposed to be here today? Jesus. That from him? To get you back. I know. I'm terrible. Will he be able to give you more? He has quite the bad boy reputation himself. Right. Fine. I'll give him a call. It's all very amicable. My wife has found herself a new backer...I mean lover...which makes her happy..  Mr. Burton has found a way of feeling young again...let's hope his pockets are deep...they'll need to be...  And I've found a way to be single again without it costing me a penny, which has to go down as the biggest win of my career. A combination of factors, not all of which I'm prepared to discuss here. Justice being done re: the disqualification in Spain helps, and having my old car back of course... Who by? So I can see why this suits you just fine. But there would be one race less where I, or anyone else, could catch you. Fine. Then let's race! There's a hundred thousand fans out there who would never forgive us if we didn't. Has Niki changed? Then we go on wets, too. Shit...! Shut up! Where's Niki? What's up? Who? What's going on? What about him? What?? They said he was half-dead. Niki? I wrote you a letter at the time. To apologize. The driver's meeting in Germany? Before the race? I swayed the room. That race should never have gone ahead. So in some ways...I feel responsible for what happened. I'm sorry. Hey..! I've got something for you on that last question... Now go home to your wife and ask her how YOU look!! Prick! The man was in a coma. His doctors pronounced him dead!! Then he comes back and does THAT??? What? I've got to go. What party? Who sent you here? This man. Did he speak with an accent? I'm afraid it was a joke.. Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not tonight. Wait..! I don't want any part of this. I'm not going to be responsible for turning the room again. I'm not voting against Niki again....or forcing fellow drivers to risk their lives. Sorry. World Championship or not... What are you doing??? But it will also let the water in. No! No! NO!!!! I'm sorry! What? Rubbish!! What about Niki?? He overtook me!! I saw it!! A Ferrari with a red helmet.. What??? I heard you were spending more and more time in one of these... No. And there I was thinking you were about to wax lyrical about the romance of flight. I should have known better. A friend's wedding. At least I think it was a wedding. Might have been a birthday. All a bit of a blur. How about you? Been at Fiorano? Already? In February? You're relentless. I'm not sure I meant it as a compliment. Are you mad? I didn't just win the biggest thing of my life so I could get right back to work. Because what...? Because of your accident? Is that other people, Niki? Or you? I won. On the all important day when it came down to it, we raced on equal terms in equally good cars. You bottled and I had the guts to see it through. Why? That's winning? Sounds like losing to me. Some of life needs to be for pleasure, Niki. What's the use of having a million cups and medals if you never have any fun? How is that winning? No, not bad. I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy myself first. And so should you. You think you can? See you on race day, Champ."
disturbia,KALE ,Shia LaBeouf," Whoa, did you see that thing? Holy shit! I need reinforcements!  Dad, your pirate -- impersonation -- sucks!! He's freakin' pulling us in!  That fish is going down.  Hey mom, it's us. Listen, fire up the grill 'cause the Bassmasters are headed home! Yes, be gone with the red meat! DAD -- I think so. Oh my God, dad -- I can't -- It won't give -- Dad, here -- Dad, please, you can do it -- No -- I'm not leaving -- NO -- Dad, please, I've got you -- Este invierno -- Este verano -- voy a -- I don't know, alright?    I haven't gotten that far.  Guess not. The execution squad shows up?  Hobby, you read me? I said come around my left flank and draw his fire -- damn straight I'm trying to get you smoked, you've been hiding behind my ass the whole game -- Hobby, Jet, you guys still there? I got nothin'. What, so he can tell me I'm ADD, have PTSD, and severe IAD?  Freakin' irritated ankle disorder.  C'mon, bid a dollar, one dollar --  News. And your point is? You canceled my Xbox subscription. That might be difficult. That's a little dramatic, isn't it? I'm just gonna plug it back -- What are you, mental? Yes!  Dammit, Ronnie, I'm losing my mind. Give me some details, what's happening out there? Wait, Ronnie -- Hello? GODDAMMIT! I'm coming!! Oh shit!   Shit water shit! You think that's funny? Not before I shove this shit up your ass! Shit! Turn green turn green turn green... No, c'mon, I'm way inside, turn green -- Yes!   That's what I'm talking about! It's cool, I'm all green.  Okay, fine, but if I'd known -- Hey doggie, come here...  Hey, you and me both.  I've got something to show you, too.  I mean... there's such structure to it, so many layers, but it's invisible if you're not looking close enough... The world right outside the window.  Just wait... and...  Three... two... one... dog... ...Mrs. Pilch... saying goodbye to Lonnie...  Maid. Four o'clock every Thursday, she goes to the country club to play tennis with Betty Big-Bangs there. And... ladies disappear... cue white Mercedes... Mr. Pilch... arriving from the office...  Will you just look -- He can't. We don't have any lights on. Plus the angle's sharper from ground level, it only seems like he could see us. I did the math. Optical illusion, line-of-sight doesn't apply to the subject. Now tilt your gaze up... C'mon, there's more. No, stalking's for psychos. These are just simple observations... natural side effects of chronic boredom.  So... Robert Giles... He's lived there a couple of years, but I've never noticed he mows his lawn every two days. Next to him is Judy Thorp. Dude, she freakin' sneaks over to her neighbors' every morning, steals their newspaper, I guess reads it or swipes the coupons, then puts it back before they even wake up. Last stop on the tour. Don't know. Nope, no I'm fine. Thanks, that was really humiliating. Oh, you mean that thing with the cops? They had the wrong guy, total foul up. I'm Kale by the way. Hey, so -- how'd the move go? I'd help, but...  I'm a little spatially challenged at the moment.  But minus the 48-hour allowance for office visits. And no lame ""Apprentice"" spin-off.  So where'd you move from? That doesn't sound good. Oh, sorry, I was just gonna see if you wanted to hop in my Hummer and cruise to a kegger.  Nice talking to you. I know the tone. Noticed that, too.  You started without me? What are you stopping for?  No -- Whoa.  -- Mustang -- Holy shit.   A dent -- What?   No, I -- Nothing, just watching the wind blow. No, see for yourself.  '65 or '66, couldn't tell. Movement. Better late than never.  That's definitely new. Jackass! Dick, my deaf aunt in Omaha heard that.  I think she saw me -- Seriously?  No, she usually takes her time -- It's not gonna be her. I have to. It's her. She totally saw us --  Dude, she knows I'm here. Yeah, no, we were playing upstairs --  So... what brings you here. Do you need to call anyone? Uh, sure, come on in -- That's Ronnie. Excuse me... It's a little messy. So you hear about that missing girl from Madison? He drives a car like the one she was seen in. 60's era Mustang. They said it was dented.     His has a bashed-in fender. Hey -- Yeah --  What? How'd he fix it so fast --  You serious?  She's right.  They think it might be linked to some murders in Texas two years ago. About two or three years. Not that I've seen --  He's been gone awhile. How'd you get my phone? What'd you do? What the hell? Where's -- So that's why the grass is greener... So why the move? No, seriously. What did they think, an extra bathroom and two-car garage would actually change things... somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape? That's him. No. How do you know?  Missing girl was seen at a club. Didn't say which one though...  Your I.D. must be pretty good. He's going in. What do you think they're listening to? And she's down for the count. Looks like. What were you expecting? Does that disappoint you? 'Cause I can be more messed up if you want me to. ""Fine?"" ""Fine"" like your first cousin ""fine"" or ""fine"" in kind of a Brad Pitt sorta way? I can't hear --  I can't --  Ashley, come on... Are you nuts?! Mom? Dammit. Shit! Dumbass dumbass -- Okay, so where is she -- Oh shit oh shit...  Ronnie -- Giles totally busted me. They were arguing -- Giles and the girl he brought home. They had an argument, he grabbed her -- And then -- nothing. Dude, something is going on over there. What if he killed her, too? Wait -- A door just slammed. Asshole, I'm serious. Just -- wait -- wait till I check the hall -- Goddamn you!! No, don't! Ronnie -- just Ronnie. I heard the door -- Fine.   Good.     Okay -- Anything caffeinated. I know, how did you -- Dad put those security bolts on --  Gee, really lucky you were there. Yeah, I do. That's right. I think I'd like to hear his opinion. I popped my Spanish teacher. I like your shirt, by the way.    I mean, the color. Oh, the... that dark orange.   Always reminds me of Texas. Sure, absolutely. Even though I've never stepped foot in Texas -- Huh. Just a black eye. I know, he's a total freak, right? Are you messing with me? So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car -- The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen -- Maybe.  Her car hasn't moved. Well what if she's really ""not moving?"" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death -- You're leaving? Whose? How is that possible? Well, I mean... Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody -- Oh my god, ""Skinny Psycho?!"" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish -- And now the whole neighborhood's coming. Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain.  Well, I appreciate the thought. Really. It's funny, though. I didn't peg you as a conformist.  Yeah, I'm calling about the Jeep Cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug -- it's ready? Listen, did they have to replace the whole tire -- they patched it? Is there any way to tell if it was slashed or -- But a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile, doesn't it? I mean it's a really slow leak, it can't flatten a tire in twenty minutes.  -- Yeah, I guess anything's possible. Wait, what was that? You think I'm watching? Well, I'm not... Nope, I am minding my own business... You think I'm buying that? I'm not biting -- That's it. Hey! Take it easy, that's sixty gigs of my life. Okay -- okay -- What are you doing? Coulda fooled me. Forget -- You wanna blend in with that crowd, fine, then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me. It's not a cover -- What else have I seen? Okay -- I've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three. Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to... well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit. When you end up in a place like this... when your parents dump their baggage on you, or just... when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop -- It sucks, but just so you know -- I get it. But I've also seen those designer window shades of yours, and guess what? They always go up the next day -- no matter what. And even if no one else has, I've noticed that. And I ain't sorry. The only thing I'll even consider apologizing for is... not dropping the binoculars and telling you this a lot sooner. Hey. If would have gone to the flower shop, but -- Oh, two months, twelve days, nineteen hours give or take. You know the other night... when you said you thought I'd be more messed up... I didn't kill my -- Three-thirty. You better see this. Look, quick --  Her car... still hasn't moved... Phase one, steal his code from his opener. There's only two. Now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his Toyota. All you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. ""On"" or ""off."" No, not breaking in. We're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time - when he's not there - to just... to get a closer look at the car, the bag --  This is good up to thirteen digits -- Look, if we're gonna do this, it's gotta be now. He takes twenty-one minutes average to mow his front yard... you'll be hearing him the whole time...  Yo, you set? Let me conference Ashley in. (punches buttons; then) Ashley, you there? Nice. Okay, Ron -- Green light. You're all good. You okay -- Dude, glove compartment, other side. Well, while you're there, will you just check? You see the package? Whenever you're ready. Just start over. No, no -- Ronnie, he's coming around.  Ronnie, I am not dicking with you. The neighbor is also mowing her lawn and he's going to see you -- GET IN THE CAR!! Put the remote back -- Easy on the door. Don't panic, he's coming straight for you -- Back seat, NOW! Ashley -- Shut up, stay down and don't move. Ronnie, you're good -- Ronnie? Ronnie, was that the whole code? Ronnie?  Okay, Ashley, you're good, come on... Was that the whole code?  The code, did you get it?  No way. Getting her license number -- ""Yeah, he seemed like such a normal guy. Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me."" That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say -- after the fact. Only after they've caught the guy, after he's killed thirty people --  Fine, but what about the bumper sticker, there's still a girl missing, just... what's in the bag?  Can anyone tell me that?  Ronnie, you've seen this satellite website, right? You can find any location on earth and take a picture -- Trying to get to the bottom of this. What's it look like? Not who I think. What, crazy?     Maybe I am.   But maybe I'm right. Are you two gonna help me or not?  Then start looking through these --  Well, this is all I need, so -- I guess I'll see you later. So what's your deal? You hanging out or not? Sure. Get off me, man.  Ronnie, I know you think I'm losing my mind, but... listen, I'll help you get it, I just need you to do one thing.  You read? Got video, no audio. Light on, far end.  No movement. Stay calm, it's there. You're still clear, check the bag. Try to get the plate number of the Mustang and check for dents -- The camera's sliding -- Ronnie? Ronnie?! He's in the house --  Ronnie? What the hell -- RONNIE!    Shit -- Ronnie?! Ronnie, can you hear me?! Giles, open the door!! Hey! Please, my friend's been kidnapped, he's in this house -- he's inside, I think the owner's trying to kill him -- It was already open. You're a lying son of a bitch! He's in there, goddammit!   He's inside! He's lying! Okay, but he's lying -- he has my friend, and he kidnapped that girl last week, he killed maybe three others, all redheads, they could be in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag -- in his garage -- my friend knew this --  That's why he's covering -- he didn't just wake up five minutes ago -- So why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? Because it was covered in her blood --  So where's my friend, then? Can anyone tell me that? Does anyone believe me?! Mom -- It was -- Yeah. I just -- didn't think you'd believe me -- OH MY GOD -- Shit -- Ronnie -- How -- How long have you been here? Still, you could have --  I get it. Why didn't Giles tell the cops someone broke in? I mean, he did see you, right? What if he wasn't always a guy?  Dead deer. I was watching, remember? So that's when the garage door started closing. That's great. Yeah, I lost signal --  I'm gonna burn this. You're not fooling me, Giles...  Ronnie, get your ass up here! Ronnie?! Ronnie -- MOM!! It's dead.  Living room -- tied up -- he got Ronnie -- in the kitchen --  GODDAMN YOU!! No, I've gotta get her --  Okay, but -- just follow my lead -- we're gonna need stuff -- Once I have his attention, you go get her.  We're out here, asshole! Ashley!   Are you okay? Stick to the plan -- That was a warning! Where's my mom? I don't know -- the cops should be here any sec -- No flashing lights -- stay here -- Parker, where's the cavalry?! Parker, you need to get them here right now -- Giles is -- PARKER LOOK OUT, HE'S THE --  He was my best friend. We always talked about what guys talk about... sports, women... food... We were talking about the freakin' fish -- this huge, amazing black bass we'd just caught -- and how we'd be eating it for a week... the next thing I know -- I can't hold on... and he's letting go... I was so pissed at him, I was so -- he's the one who left, he's the one who gave up, you know? -- But that's b.s. See, the truth is, my dad -- He saved me. Movement. She's whacked. Plain and simple. I think she thought it'd be some sick challenge or something -- hey, commission's the same I guess... No way.   She can't be serious.  Fine, but we still have to seriously question the yayhoos buying the place.  Screw that. My mom has another half hour over there at least."
moon,SAM 1 ,Sam Rockwell,"Where am I? I saw someone out there, Gerty. I saw a girl. Gerty? Is there someone in the room with us? Who is he? Hi. Gerty, what the hell is going on? Who is that guy in the Rec Room? Where did he come from? Why does he look like me? Yes, Gerty, I'm out of bed.   Who is the guy in the rec room? Who the fuck is in the rec room, Gerty!? I don't understand what's happening, Gerty. I think I may be losing my mind. Recovered alive? What do you mean? Why haven't you reported to central? You're Sam Bell. I'm Sam Bell, too. This is fucked up. Why... What are you? How long have you been here? How are you getting on? They locked all the exits? What about the harvesters? I'm not a clone. You're the clone. Almost three years.  Right. No, not really. Listen, I wanted to say thank- you. If it wasn't for you I'd still be out there in the crashed rover. You saved my life.  Will you shake my hand? You look just like me. It's incredible. We look like each other, I guess. Your serve. Two points to eighteen. I don't remember doing all of it. I remember when I did the church and the Salvation Army. And a few of the people. My mind's been acting kind of weird lately, though. Uh-huh. You know Fairfield?  That's the Baskin&Robbins. And there's Tess and Eve. Do you know Tess? You know about Eve, right? We had a girl. She's beautiful. She's really beautiful. Nine pounds, eleven ounces. They're sending a Rescue Unit? Why? Then I'm going back. I've done my three years. That's it for me -- What? I've got a contract -- I'm going home! I'm the original! I'm Sam fucking Bell! Me! Me! Gerty, am I a clone? That's ridiculous. Impossible. Why would hey do that?  Secret room?  You're the one who's lost the plot! I've been here for three years. I know every inch of this base. I know how many dust fibres are between those wall panels over there -- why would they do that?! Tess would know. Tess would know what's going on! She wouldn't let that happen! I told you. Why? You're not moving the model. No. Get off me! Who are you?  Who are you! Hi Gerty. We had a fight. Me and the other guy, the other Sam. We had a fight, Gerty. He's a maniac. You know what he did? He flipped the entire model over. Do you know how much work I've put into that thing? 938 hours, exactly.  Really? 938 hours.  He scares me, Gerty. He flies off the handle. I see it now...I see what Tess was talking about.  I've never told you this, Gerty, but she left me. Tess left me. For six months. She moved back in with her parents. Oh...  It was the year before I came in here. She gave me a second chance. I promised her I'd change. Yeah, I guess I have. Gerty, since I've been up here I've sent Tess over a hundred video messages. Where did those messages go? Did they ever reach her? What about the messages she sent to me? Gerty, am I really a clone? I remember. And Tess?    Eve? No thanks, Gerty. You okay? Better. It's okay. Yes you do. Absolutely. Right. A live conversation? That's not possible. How do you know the conversation was live? The communications equipment is damaged -- there was a solar storm -- Tabitha, right. How are they blocking the live feed? The base's communications equipment works fine -- From where then? Just passing the last of the Harvesters -- looks like John -- If I maintain this speed...a minute. Ninety seconds tops. No, never. You see anything yet? There isn't shit out here...I feel like I'm about to drive off the end of the world.  It would help if I knew what I was looking for. Wait a second, wait a second. I see something. Don't know yet. Looks like some kind of antenna. Whoever built these things meant business. They weren't fucking around. What do you think? Yeah, I hear you.  I'm going to head back to base. I'm not feeling too good. Fuck!  January 12th, Lunar hour 8:32. All Harvesters running smoothly today. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 12.7 miles; Mark 11.9 miles...  Luke, 12.9 miles; John, 11.1 miles... I found your secret room. The cryo pod in the Return Vehicle is an incinerator. We don't go home. We're burned to death up there. Then the company wakes up a new one. Every three years. Like clock work.  I hacked into the Old Man. Actually, Gerty did. I saw footage. You're right, there have been other clones before us. Enough. Not now, Gerty, okay? Gerty? Why did you help me? With the password? Doesn't that go against your programming or something? There's something I've got to do. Come on...come on... Uh, Bell residence? I'm trying to reach Tess Bell. No...no way. Tess Bell? Are you sure? Eve?  Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you now? How did mom die, sweetheart? Want me to help? Remember that crazy drunk guy who used to hang out by the church?  He looked like Barbara Streisand. We used to hide his Bible when he passed out. Drove the guy nuts. Want me to show you? You need to hold the wood away from you. Like this. Watch what I'm doing.  You watching? Now you try. You'll get the hang of it.  You see, that's a little better already. I think I'm dying. There's blood in everything. My urine. My vomit. I've got a constant headache. Dizzy spells.  The same thing happened to the other clones. I saw it when I hacked into the Old Man. After three years they all started to get sick. Now it's happening to me. Well, it's been happening for a while now. A couple of weeks. Maybe we don't live that long. Maybe we start to decompose or something.  No tranqs. I don't think I would ever wake up again. Uh, Bell Residence? I'm trying to reach Tess Bell. Tess Bell? Are you sure? Why?  That guy? They'll expect to find a dead body in the crashed Rover.  You're going to kill him? What about us? Eliza arrives, finds you and me as the welcome party -- How do you think she died? I wish I'd been there. No. We don't have to do anything. I changed my mind. I'm not going back.  I'm coughing up blood, I'm as white as a ghost. I look like I belong in a graveyard. I meet Eve now, I'll scare the shit out of her more than anything else. D'you think she'll even come within ten feet of me, the way I look?  She's not! She's not... my daughter. At least, I'm not her father. Not to her. I'll put myself in the Rover, I'll be the body -- it was me to begin with anyway, right? You go back to Earth. You go back. You're healthy. You've got three years ahead of you. You stand a much better chance than I do. The other guy....Gerty can get him up to speed...he can be here to meet Eliza when they arrive. I don't know.  It's what we were designed to do. You're a good guy, Sam. Yeah. You should travel.     I've always wanted to do that. Tess came in for the interview, remember? She was so beautiful. Even   if she wasn't the best candidate,   I just knew I had to give her the   job. I thought she was so sweet.  And then it was the end of   the summer."
clerks,DANTE ,Brian O'Halloran," Next time, I get the bed.  Shit. Shit. Shit! Thanks. Have a good one. Sure. Go ahead. Yeah. Beats me. Excuse me, but... Fifty-five. Maybe you should take that coffee outside. If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers. Hey, now wait a sec... I think you'd better leave now. You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance. That's it, everybody out. Yeah, but not in here. Like I'm responsible for all the smokers! Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me! I hate this fucking place. Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point. I'm not even supposed to be here today! The guy got sick and couldn't come in. Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep! I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in. Somebody jammed the locks with gum. Bunch of savages in this town. I don't know-like two-thirty, three.  Hunhh? Nothing. Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now? Who's defensive? Just...Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged. What? What is that? Oh, be real! Would you...Would you please hug me? I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on. What? What's with that look?! I wasn't talking to anyone, especially her! Look at you, being all sort of...I don't know...stand-offish. Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug me. I see how it is. All right Pissy-pants, you just go on being suspicious and quiet. I don't even want to hug you at this point.  Give you a dollar?  Thanks. Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning. Why do you say that? Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched. I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off. Why? You wanna have sex or something? Really? Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me. How do you figure? Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there. Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat. Now, making a woman cum...therein lies a challenge. A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent. Something wrong? I touched a nerve. It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization. These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me. How many what? How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once? Including you?  Twelve. Including you; yes. What the hell was that for? Why'd you hit me? Do I get to hit you after you tell me? Three? You've only had sex with three different people? Who? No; who were the three, besides me?  Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of. Animal, vegetable, or mineral. They put up the least amount of struggle. All right. Name it. Where? Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up? Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this. Shit! Why are we getting up? How are you? Just the soda? Why do you call him that? What do you mean? He requested this? Sylvan can be talked into anything. Like you said-she snowballed him. Yeah, right. You sucked that guy's dick?  But...but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him! You sucked his dick!  Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys? Oh my God-I feel so nauseous... I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said. How many? How many dicks have you sucked?! HOW MANY? This is different. This is important. How many?! Well...? WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX? What the hell is that anyway, ""something like thirty-six?"" Does that include me? I'M THIRTY-SEVEN? Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks! Hey! Where are you going?! No, but you sucked enough dick! A few?  Well...why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?! I feel sick. Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.  Thirty-seven. I just can't... Try not to suck any more dicks on your way through the parking lot! HEY! HEY, YOU! GET BACK HERE! I called his house twice already. He should be here soon. I'm sure he wasn't sleeping. No; he was probably just resting his eyes. Actually, that's his night job. If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.  You forgot your keys. You're late. The boss called. Arthur fell ill. Someone jammed gum in the locks. That's what I said. He assured me that he'd be here by twelve. Go open the sore. Shocking abuse of authority. Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious. No, thanks. Why? You don't want to know. She called me. One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks. I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction. You win. Seven months. Five years. Eight and a half. Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me. In the middle of it, she calls me Brad. She called me Brad. I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson. She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party. Great story, isn't it? Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom? Allan Harris. The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep. It takes different strokes to move the world. Because there was a lot of good in our relationship. I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity. They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone. I'm talking to myself here. ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level. I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin. I think it's safe to say yes. All four? Yes, I'd like to check on a misprint in today's edition...Today's edition...It says ""Bree to Wed Asian Design Major...No, no; everything's spelled fine. I just wanted to know if the piece was a misprint...I don't know, like a typographical error or something... Maybe it's supposed to be Caitlin Bray, or Caitlin Bre, with one e...I'm a curious party...A curious party... ...I'm an ex-boyfriend...Well, it's just that we talk all the time, and she never mentioned this engagement, which is why I'm thinking maybe it's a misprint... ...Are you sure?...Maybe there's like a vindictive printer working for you... Meaning like someone who maybe-I don't know-asked her out once and got shot down, and his revenge is throwing this bogus article in when the paper went to press...Hello?...Hello? You hold the counter and I'll pull.  Maybe we should soap your hand or something. I think it's coming now... I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure. A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go. Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married! Me pulling a can off some moron's fist. Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.  Empire. Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets. What's that? The Emperor. How do you mean? I guess. Yeah. It would stand to reason, yes. More or less. I think they were Catholics. Yeah. Come in. There's more? Yeah. Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due. Compliments of Lando Calrissian. And you figured it out? Basically. And the second time around...? So? Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at. All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction? My friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels. Whose house was it? Based on personal politics.  Wait. This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look. This has been going on for twenty minutes. He said he has to find a perfect dozen. Each egg has to be perfect. Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade. I told him that and he yelled at me. He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore. I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today. You know him? Why do you say that? Why guidance counselors? Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie. What's a jizz-mopper? Nudie booth? I guess not. What kind of show?  Can we talk about this later? Excuse me? We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away. Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry! Please, wait a second, ma'am... Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss. I'm gonna hear it tomorrow. What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them. There aren't.  It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.  The milkmaids. The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade. Which ones? No. Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.  Veronica! He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class? What is it? Really?  You're the best.  Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.  Why don't you go back to the video store? I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective. At least he wasn't thirty-six. And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen. ...it isn't there. Yes. Thank you for the lasagne. I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow. What time do you get finished? Sure. Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call. The best Burtless movie ever made. Hello, is Mr. Synder there? This is Dante...Did he say if he was on his way here?...Here...The convenience store...I know, but the other guy called out this morning and Mr. Synder asked me to cover until he got here. He said he'd be here by noon, but it's one-thirty now, so I...Excuse me...Vermont?!...No, that can't be; I talked to him this morning...He left at what time?...He really went to Vermont?...When the hell was someone going to tell me?...He promised he was coming by noon!...Jesus...When does he get back?!...TUESDAY!...You've gotta be fucking kidding me!...I've got a hockey game at two, and the fucking shutters are jammed closed, and he's in Vermont?...I'm not even supposed to be here today!!  So I'm stuck here till closing?...This is just great...I just can't believe...I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you...No...No, I'll be all right...Well, that's all I can do, right?...Thanks. Can you believe this?! Not a fucking word! Slippery shit! FUCK! What? I know. I don't back down. You know what pisses me off the most? I'm going to miss the game. Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping. Sorry. I can't believe I'm going to miss the game! You've got a customer. Sanford? Dante...I can't play today...I'm stuck at work...I know I'm not scheduled, but-just forget it. I can't play...Neither can Randal...He's working too...  Wait a second. Do we have to play at the park?...Hold on...  Do you feel limber?  Pull my laces tighter. I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault. I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to. If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one. So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades. I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks. At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here. All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy. Can we not talk about this? I don't know. You going to lock the video store? We're not playing in the street. Ready?  If you can just wait a few more minutes. I'll be right back. It's almost over. In a second! I can pass! Who are you to make assessments? Like you're better! That's easy to say from over here.  There's a stick over there. You're shooting against the goal.  REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK ON! Give me another ball. What the fuck are you talking about? How many balls did you bring? Are there any balls down there?! You only brought one ball?! Nobody has another ball? We get...what...twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today! I'm trying. So I'm told. And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?  Oh...Can I help you? Um...yeah, but it's for employees only. Uh...sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler. The white kind. Actually, it is kind of rough. Yeah, but... Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Jesus...go ahead. You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there. I said go ahead. The porno mags?  Here. Now leave me alone. One ball!! They come all the way here...I close the damn store...for one ball! Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up! Gatorade. Exactly. They drank it all.  ""It's not like we're gonna sell out."" I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married. Yeah, right. Oh, my god. How? When? Jesus. I haven't seen her in almost two years. Number six. I'm gonna go to her wake. Why not? What!? Shit. What about tomorrow? You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this. You hardly knew her! Stop it. This is beneath even you. You hate people. Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store. She meant nothing to you! I'm not taking you to this funeral. I can't close the store. Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake. Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend. Twenty-two; same as us. An embarrassing way to die. How'd he die? That's embarrassing? Shut the hell up. Stop it. Oh, my god. No! Because I never tried to suck my own dick? Who found him? His dick was in his mouth? He made it, hunhh? I could never reach. You know. Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later. I know it was a bad idea to close the store. I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.  I can't fucking believe you!! You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes! Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose? Her fucking body fell out!  Just...go! Go open the video store.  Go open the video store.  How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store. I don't want to talk to you. Why should I loan you my car?  You want to rent a movie. You work in a video store! Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?  May I be blunt with you? We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which- though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing. There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.  Yes. It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you? My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working. They certainly do. Two fifty-five. What? Exactly. That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything. Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me. I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.  What the fuck did you do that for? Jesus! What?  You're a danger to both the dead and the living. Please, get the hell out of here. Excuse me? I didn't strain. I sighed. I don't think so. They are not. What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body. Yes.  Thirty-fire. I am not. I don't know. I know I can bench more than that! Oh for God's sake!  Yes.  I'm not out of shape. What?  I don't have love handles. I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why? I'm not out of shape! Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about? Do I know you? Caitlin Bree. Yeah? You're Alyssa's sister? Heather? Yeah. Yeah? How do you know that? No, she's getting married. What? You know him? Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her? I...I don't believe this... THE GLADES MOTEL? What? When? When did all this shit happen? Jesus Christ, what next? What's this? WHAT? What are you talking about? I didn't do that! Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid! I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear! But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey! Jesus! What next? What? Caitlin? When did you get back? My God. I haven't seen you since... Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home? I can't believe you're here.  To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying? So I'm told. I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed. Very dramatic, I thought. What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation? You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend. And you said yes? Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is? How do you know that? So you're really getting married? No, you're not really getting married? How like her. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. And you came here to what? To comfort me? But you were. Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle-I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. What? Sang? His name is a past tense? If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? There's more, isn't there? Tell me I don't have something to do with it. You lie. I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. Jesus, you're caustic. So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. Buy can we date? We could introduce them. They might hit it off. I would like to be your boyfriend, yes. Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market... Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. So...what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? Let me take you out tonight. Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. You have a better suggestion? I hear that's a rather popular date. What about Sing? Sang. He's your fianc. So what are you saying? I'm just kidding. I'll ask Randal to close up for me- when he gets back. He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note. Who doesn't? What happened to the walk and the nakedness? YES!  What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds? And this is what you rented? I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor. Five hundred dollars.  Living proof. I don't; you did. Little girl. Maybe five years old? As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here. Because I'm here. I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up. Because I'm happy. I'm happy. No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me. I'm not. She just left. She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother. I'm not. She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out. Watch the store while I go home and change. This is my way of spitting water at life. No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word. In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns. I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.  I'll read the book. Who eats cock? There's no lights back there. I love your sexy talk. It's so...kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee. I left like an hour ago. Could be. Like what? Um...okay.  It wasn't me.  Was it you? I'm serious. No. I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside. I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there? Are you sure somebody was back there? Shut the fuck up!  Call the police. There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin! WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM? I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom. Um...I don't know.  What time did hockey end? What time did we go to the funeral? Just me. We did. Nobody. It was closed. Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there. Was he alive when...Caitlin... No. I gave it to him. Well he asked me for it! What about Caitlin? She thought it was me. This life. Why do I have this life? I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddam steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex-girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks. My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit. I was born. I should shit or get off the pot. What are you talking about? Fuck you. What responsibility? As if it's that easy. Leave me alone. Oh, like your life's any better? Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store? Leave her out of this. Leave me alone. ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do. You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin. Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible. What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change. I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes. Jesus H. Christ, I can't!  My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants. Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably. Done poisoning the youth for the day? One seventy-nine. A half hour. I should start. With you? I don't think so. Nothing personal. How do you figure...HEY! You can't roll a joint in here! It's not my store. The difference is you exploit a weakness. You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction. A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax. So. I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here. He died in the bathroom. I don't know. I wasn't watching. Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend. We were going to start again, I think. Veronica. Lasagne. Maybe. I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on. She's my girlfriend. Meaning?  He's right. I love her. What the fuck did you do that for? What're you talking about? It was only a few times... A couple...? Would you let me explain...  Veronica...I...it's not like that anymore...I mean, it was never really like that... I don't want Caitlin... I don't want to go back with her...  Randal...? Veronica, I love you...  The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck? Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin? Thanks. Jesus. Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you. Why do I say that? Randal...forget it. What don't you do? Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable. What time did you get to work today? You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here. Which means the video store is ostensibly closed. Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores. You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today! You need a ride? Do you work tomorrow? I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica. I'll call you. Let you know. No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about. To say the least. Get the fuck outta here already. What'd you forget something?  Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed."
looper,JOE ,Joseph Gordon-Levitt," Time travel has not yet been invented. But twenty five years from now it will be. Once the technology exists, it will be relatively cheap and available to the public at large. And so. It will be instantly outlawed, used only in secret by the largest criminal organizations. And then only for a very specific purpose. Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse from the flatbed. It's nearly impossible to dispose of a body in the future. I'm told. Tagging techniques, whatnot. So when these future criminal organizations in the future need someone gone, they use specialized assassins in our present, called loopers. And so. Thirty years from now. My employers in the future nab the target, they zap him back to me, their looper. And I do the necessaries. So the target has vanished from the future, and I've just disposed of a body that technically does not exist. Clean. The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little flare of angry red fire. Bon jour, Beatrix. Slow. How's the coffee? Two, Jedd. Yup. Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves his gun and exits. Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang! Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok. Seth. That's new. Seth kicks the bike. Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick with rubber on the road. They get respect cause they run the town. How much did that thing set you back? How much? Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm. Congratulations. You're pulling up with me instead. Joe notices the floating quarter. And don't, if we're going in, don't do that. It's tacky, don't do it. Seth catches the quarter, sullen. When the TK mutation started appearing in the general populace it was on every magazine - Next Step in Evolution, what's next. Everyone got tested. But turns out this was it, and now it's just a bunch of assholes thinking they're blowing your mind by floating quarters. Big heads. Small potatoes. Drives past, revving the engine. We'll stick backstage, just meeting up. In and out. Hardly. Right Seth? So I've read. He ducks out. What? For what? No shit? The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder then retracts into the door. The loopers watch him in awe. There's a reason we're called loopers. Time travel in the future is so illegal, that when we sign up for this job we agree to a very specific proviso. If our employers in the future get busted up by the law, their first priority is going to be erasing any trace of their relationship with us ever existing. A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his head kneels in front of Zach. Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes. So. If they're busted, and if we're still alive 30 years from now, they'll find our older self and zap him back to us, like any other job. Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing several dozen gold bars taped to his back. This is called closing your loop. Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face through the sack. And you get paid out a mythic amount of money, and you get a handshake and get released from your contract. Enjoy the next 30 years. This job doesn't tend to attract the most forward thinking people. Sell that goddamn slat bike back. That's a lot of stupid money. Alright. Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants. Hey Seth. Seth slumps against the car. Alright, Zach. What's his payout, 30? 40? If that? That's not going to last you 30 years. And it won't get you overseas. So in five, ten years you're back to riding the rails, or worse you're like Kid Blue, working as a gat man, wagging your dick at loopers and roughing up shop clerks for payoff money. Save a little something. Alright? Cause that'll be yours, and then you've got yours and that's all that matters, your life is your own. Ravi de te voir, Beatrix. Two, Jedd. Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then hands him out a small stack of cash. Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number 2'. All the other transactions have the number 4'. Fourth. On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage. You working a shift tonight? Oh. Jesus, Seth. No, they're not here. Who? Seth, sit down here. CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table. Tell me now. Seth, what did you do? I knew then what he did so I don't know why I asked. What did you do? Seth lifts his eyes to Joe. This is called letting your loop run. It's not a good thing. You fucking idiot coming here. Seth, sucker punched. You can't be here, I'll give you a little money but you gotta You hop a freight train, you beat it the hell out POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses Shut up. Don't move. Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside. I can't do anything for you Seth. Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand. Hold on! Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug. A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it. Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big enough for a man. Seth scrambles in. Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face, framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the oriental rug. POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door. Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose. One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face. You think it's easy looking this good? There's coffee in the tin. Alright, cut it out Kid. You're gonna blow your foot off again. The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins. C'mon. Dunno I agree with that. This man is from the future. He was sent back here by the mob, a one way ticket, to run the Loopers. That's low effort even for Abe, so to pass the time he recruited some real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he runs the city. Any other city, that'd be impressive. Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe. Ties. Okay. A beat of silence. Well it was nice chatting with you Abe. Seth? My friend Seth? I'm confused. Watch shop. You know I'm grateful, Abe. Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going. Okay. Will you kill him? Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742. One of the gat men quietly exits. I can't remember my mother's face. I remember her touching my hair. Like this. He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in his eyes. Do you want to go overseas? Soon, maybe. Is that how it aughta be? Oh god. Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But realizing. Late to my own funeral. Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell him keep my bars safe cause I swear to god I'm going to fix this, I'm going to find my loop and I'm gonna kill him. Tell Abe- CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right ear explodes. More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now footsteps running down the hall. Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway, shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW. Where would I go if I were me. I ordered something. ...ok. Yeah. Didn't know if you'd I'm not cutting myself again to- It's an interesting question, I've just lost a lot of blood today. Good. I don't care what you're here for, whatever you think you're going to get from me. More time or whatever you want. I can't let you walk away from this diner alive. Because the next 30 years of my I've got a life ahead of me that's mine and I'm not giving it up for you or anybody Your face looks backwards. I wasn't trying to. Do you know what's going to happen? Have you already done all this, right now, as me? When I hurt myself now, it changes your body. Do my actions change your memories? What's the pepper? So you can So when we're apart you can remember what I do. After I do it. Who? Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he stares at it intently. This is a woman, what? I'm going to fall in love with? She's. How is she, you said save my life. My life is my own, I don't need it Seth said, that night. A new boss in the future, he said. That would take an army. How did he do it? None of this concerns me. We're done we're gonna walk outside now. It happened to you, it doesn't have to happen to me.  You got her picture in there? Show it to me. Show me her picture. And when I see her for the first time I'll walk away, and she won't be with me. I guarantee the instant I look at her picture that fog in your brain will swallow up the memories of her and she'll be gone. She'll be safe. And then we can all do what we have to do. A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it. Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back. It's been awhile since we've gotten a warm-up. Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet. Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled. Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet. I've got him! He's here! A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old Joe gets the gat. With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe returns fire, glass breaking and chaos. Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks. Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet. Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe. Around back! No fuck no fucking piece of shit CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike the engine turns over with a ROAR. The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground. Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running back to the Gat Men. C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. A day. Thirsty. I can't feel my legs Thirsty. Thirsty. Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the porch, 6 years old, named CID. Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks. I just finished cleaning - alright. Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly. I'm at thirty percent. I can't do that. I need to stay here for a little while longer. Well I'm sorry. No. Sara raises the shotgun. No. You couldn't scare a retarded hobo with that thing. Literally. And that's, that's telling. You're holding a gun. I say I'm not afraid, so you describe the gun to me. But it's not the gun I'm not afraid of. Look I'm not a threat to you or your boy. I need to be on your property but I'd prefer to not have any contact with you at all, I'll stay in the fields. There's just one thing you need to do for me, and you won't have to deal with me again. He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over to her. Just, verify for me that's your house on the map. So I know I'm in the right place. A map. Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out of the barn in an hour, if you can spare it I'll take the water jug with me. Does that well have water? I'll fill it from there. Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote on the back. 07153902935. And everything changes. Does that mean something to you? For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than she was ten seconds ago. Joe scoots back Time travel hasn't been invented yet. But in thirty years it will be. I can't go back to the city and find him cause Abe, the boss, all his men are going to search the streets 24/7 till they turn up me or... him. All I have is this map. And that he's coming here. Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought. Yeah. Did you know about Loopers, what we do I think... he thinks, the instant the rainmaker dies, he'll never have been sent back, so he'll just vanish, and be back with his wife. Yeah. Someone. You know what these numbers mean. Think about what doing this would fix. What he thinks it would fix. Sara caught that, and she did not like it. He'll kill the other kids on that map and then come here last. Put off facing me. I've lost my life. I kill this man, I get it back. You can trust me. We're surrounded by the corn, that leaves us blind. He can get within fifty yards of the house without a hawk spotting him. What kind of equipment's in the barn? Nothing that shoots. Good by me. He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm. If I'm out here and you're in the house we're gonna need some way to communicate. Dinner bell. We need walkies, or buzzers. Got any ammo for that shotgun? That isn't a seasoning? What are we doing here? How do you do that? Smart. Let's say I kill people. Uh huh. Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he goes back to fitting the backing on a toy. A long beat, Joe thinking. Broken by a PIERCING NOISE. They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is shrieking, sirens blaring. Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off, they both freeze. And look up at the ceiling. Silence in the house. With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck from Joe and finishes up his work. How long have you and your mom been on the farm? I'm sorry. I'm sorry Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating. You should talk to your mom about this. Can't you pull that out with a plow? I found a, in the barn I found some parts, and I made a, thing. Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose. If you see anything, just push that, and, Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and vibrates. She regards the toy, then stares hard and cold at Joe. It's important. Last night. He woke me up. Don't tell him I told you though, he... Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe doesn't leave. You said you were his mom. He told me you're not. This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it. If he's not your son who is he? How'd she get killed? When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers. Cid told me. You have to talk to him about it. Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare. He asked about my gun. You think this is going to go away if you don't talk to him about it but it's just gonna grow Thank you granddad. No. I know him, that's what's funny. His name's Jesse. I like him. He'll go away when he doesn't find me, he won't hurt her. They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking back towards the highway. My mom gave me up. I was younger than you. We were vagrants, and she was alone, for a long time I thought she was stupid for getting on the drug she was on, it was bad stuff, it probably ended up killing her. But now I see, she was so alone. And it was what she had. She sold me. To a panhandle gang. QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the scene. But I got away. And I ran and I ended on a train, sitting in the dark in an empty freight, going to the city, and I saw myself over and over killing those men who bought me and who got my mom on what she was on. Finding them and tearing them apart. Saving my mom. A man in the city found me, put a gun in my hand, and gave me some things. I didn't have my mom anymore. I had my work, my money. My plans. For my life. That's what I'd kill for. Not something I don't have, and can't ever get back. I think we're clear. He opens the trap door, climbs out. What? Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head doesn't know where to go. That's pretty good. He's protecting his future. Not mine. A beat. Jesse. I'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her go. Sara, Jesse here's the best shot with a gat I've ever seen, when he lets you go you sit on the couch and don't do anything stupid. Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe. He's coming here Jess. My Looper, is gonna come here. I got eighty large in pure gold, I take my looper back in and get right with Abe, whatever he gives me back I'll split it with you. Ok. It's yours, all of it Cid! How did your sister die? Sara holds his gaze. Then everything breaks inside her and she collapses in sobs. Heaving. That happened to her. Cid. What is it a TK mutation? Yeah I know he will. Imagine what he could do. He doesn't. Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on the wet grass, and Joe hits the corn with a head start. Right now two things have happened. My looper knows Cid's the kid he's looking for, and my gang knows I'm here. So in fifteen minutes one or both is coming down that highway. You pack up the Gat Man's truck, whatever you can fit in ten minutes, and you drive North away from the city. One buzz means come and get me. Two or nothing, don't. He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway. And you go kill the boy. That's how you fix it. My life? Your life. Becoming you. I haven't seen that yet. Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's chest and knock him back. Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has until now blocked our line of sight down the highway. Kid Blue. The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to the dusty pavement. The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a stop and spin it around. Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss. Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as a rock. Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires scattershot. Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe. Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round after fiery round. Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud. KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to slow the bike but can't in time. In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him. He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly FIRES his buss. A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without a driver. It skids, crashes. When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head. No!"

I've got Three Daughters...  ...I thought when you wanted to pet little girls, you picked on your Daughter...Ain't that what you rich people do...now you step off the Reservation and you want to buy me?  Where Is This Girl...  Your lawyer ain't going to help you...want to guess 'why'? (he looks to Miller, who nods, ""Go ahead"". he takes the photo of Laura with the red hair, sharply, from Miller and shows it to Nadya) Y'understand the picture... He's with me... She was here. She was here, where is she...? WHERE IS SHE? (Scott thrusts the Laura Newton photo at her) She was here - She was here. Who did you call. How did they know, to come get her? ...we just go where we're sent and do what we're told when we get there...  They kill her. ...who's walking up on us...?  ...who is he? ...always a reflective surface... (then, to himself, as if reciting a litany) ""...in the city, always a reflection. In the Woods.

While Anton hesitates, not comprehending) ...the ring clicks against your riflestock, some sonobitch hears that noise, hundred yards out, and you're gonna get me killed. ...where's he going...? That's where he's going? Izzey going toward Essex?  ...what sort of place is it...? Get me there.  Get on the net. Call 'em off. Everyone off. Just me.  Just me and him. Nobody out there...  Just. Him.  You indicate that you heard me.  Put it out. (the Driver begins to speak softly, relaying his instructions on the radio. Scott turns to Anton. Softly) How you doing bright eyes...? (Anton nods. Beat, as Scott looks him over) ...breathe through your nose. It stills the heartrate.  You got my back.  ...alright, then...  Don't you go through the door without an Overwatch. ...I heard the TV, so I came in... ...what the hell you got the TV on for, there's nobody here...?  I don't wanna hurt you. Why would I hurt you? I just wanna know why the TV's on. ...I just wannit to know, I just came to ask you that question... I'm Coming Up...  Call em in... ...where's the girl...? You're dying, pal. Even it up. WHERE IS THE GIRL... WHERE IS THE GIRL... You're dying. You're dying, man. Where is the girl... ...well, you wanted to know... (pause. Scott kicks the dead man viciously)  Yeah, everybody wants to know the Secret Knowledge... ...tell it to the Chaplain. Ah, shit... Sir, it ain't mine. (Burch looks at Anton. Scott, seeing his glance) On my team, sir.  ...He's on the team. ...With the Mission, sir. The door's closed, Sir. I am here to get the girl back. Shut up. Shut up. ...drag him out... (the man does so. Scott motions for them to be quiet) ...got some business to do... Sorry, my man...traveling light... Why in the world would I believe a lying convict like you... My brother used to beat me (he raises the cop's service revolver and cocks the hammer) Nice guess, though. You a fag my friend? Then why the hell you looking at me? ...just get me on that plane. All I heard's a voice on the phone... Better question, where you've been so long, do you like girls? ...most beautiful women, eh? And this all takes place Where...? Well, that's a long way from Tiperrary, pal... Yeah, but I'm not cut out, to live in a fucken tent. Well, may it Just Be So... And, now, what's Maskala...? What's Maskala...? Well, then, you're a philosopher...huh...? How 'bout making me happy tonight... ...I say you're a stone cold whoremaster... You the candy man? Is that it? Ah. Hell...  Yeah, we just, we got to get some...yeah, you need, all we need, some tailoring tools. Yeah, in my wishlist, we had a drugstore, get us some morphine, some... ...don't whisper to me, Baby, it draws heat. What helo? Well, there you go, then. That's all fine, lad, ""But this is the fleet"". ...gimme whatever nine mil you've got... ...just gimme the mags...  ...gimme your piece. Thank you... I do not look at the downed man, Sir... ...Sir...? I stand down when the girl's back, sir. On the dustoff. Sir...? Sir...? I'm pleading with you, sir... I want to see the girl. ...he killed her...  ...rock crushes scissors... He isn't my man, Sir. He's a trainee. What do you care...? (pause. We see that Anton is having difficulty formulating his thoughts) ...in what way was that? What? Do you want some more Dope? Whaddaya want, a Dr. Pepper...? ...yeah, well, that's when people generally do fuck up. Wait for that to kick in. (Anton starts to lay back, and then, as if he is remembering something, he draws closer to Scott again.) You're gonna take that fight to bed for a while. You don't got to do it all now. ...uh huh... You saw-the-sign. What sign? The girl wasn't there. She was on a boat. She fell off the boat. She's dead.  You did what you could. You did what you were trained to do.  You did what you could.  ...then you are Truly Blessed. ...would be most grateful, sir, to be included on the mission. ""At Such Time..."" Is it in contemplation, sir...? Yes, sir.  If and When, Sir... ...please don't touch that. (Scott picks up the duffle and puts the strap over his shoulder) Don't you study knife fighting, son. You Learn to Kill. And then, f'you meet some other fellow, studied knife fighting, you send him to hell. I've always thought so. He did okay. He did okay. Why? You goin' out? You recruiting? You speak Arabic, huh...? You, reason I ask: you going in the Sandbox...? I'm just saying:  ...beautiful girl... No, I was looking at the television.  I was talking to the television. (he turns to look at the girl) That girl's too good-looking for you anyway. What are you ""rich""? What do you, ""own"" something?  Or are you ""funny"" or something...? (pause. Hold for a beat, on the confused face of the Trucker) Siddown. Lemme buy you a drink. You peel the apple?  ...well. You should wipe off the blade.  I'm   sorry if I frightened you. Yeah. I got it from a Russian fellow. No. As I remember, he seemed rather reluctant to part with it.  It's just a knife. ...workin hard... How you, Billy...?  ...you been lookin' at my house...? Mr. Reese, how are you...? (Billy goes to take care of the new customer, and turns back to deal with Scott, who is waiting to ask a question) That new saw blade come in?  I took the Long Way Home. Could I see your Right Hand, please...? Could I see it, please...? You put your wedding ring back on. Then I have to guess you're not ""on assignment"".  You're in the wrong place, baby.  How did you find me...? Well, I guess I'm not as smart as I thought I was. ""You saw the sign"". You were up for a week, you coulda seen Jack Ruby, you don't know what you saw...your first-time-out. ...then, you tell me: you saw the sign, how is it, they found the girl, the DNA...why would they do that...? Her father? Her father would do that to her? Well. You're living in a fairyland of your Own Devising. You're seeing snakes. You Got. To Leave it for your Betters. Why would you want to know?  Listen up, Pal. THEY don't go through the door. WE don't ask why. That's not a COST, it's a Benefit. Because we Got to Travel Light. You wanna lose sleep over it, get over it, or get out.  You wanted to go Through the Looking Glass. How was it? Was it more fun than Miniature Golf...? Why would I do you a favor? Fella wants to buy my car. Well what were they paying you for...? My name ain't Bobby. Back? They took it apart with a tweezers. What would that be? ...he was off boffing his girl. Yeah? Sir, I am not here to question... ...and... And. Sir...If I may... When the operation is staged in Dubai... I am merely saying, when - I... I'd like to finish what I started. Is there no operation in Dubai...? I heard it was a training accident. I've been out of town. I do not follow you, sir. I would never betray you, sir. No excuse, sir. ...I'll call him off.  Terrible thing.  Did you know him?  ...you know. Yes. I Did. A few of us knew. I'm so sorry. Did she know? His wife. Did she know? ...after his shift. ...him...?nan ...where are you...? No. Tell me later. Look: LOOK: Forget the boat house. Look:  Yes, tell me in...tel...look: tell me when...GET OUT OF THERE. GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW. TELL ME WHEN YOU SEE ME. MEET ME ""WHERE...WHERE THE GUY MADE THE PHONECALL"" - ONE HALF-HOUR... ...ohmigod... What the hell are you doing? Why're you screwing with the door...? Why're you screwing with the door...? ...yeah. Thanks. You're right, I'm wrong...I'm wrong. There you go, Pal. Hold on... It's been...quite a while since my last confession. That...that ""transpired"". On the rear face of a hill, in a mortar attack.  And I confessed that I was frightened.  And I have to confess, I'm frightened now.  'Nother ""irregular Confession"". ...I'm about as frightened as I'm comfortable being.  And that's why...I involved you.  Which, I suppose, was shameful.  ...this girl's alive...  A relative? Well.  Can we blame her...? (he gestures, meaning, we get comfort where we can find it)  United States Secret Service. He'd let her die? Her father would let her die...? ...her mother...? I need some money.  I'm going to get the girl back. I need money. I need a lot of money. Alright... (he scribbles a figure on a napkin) Can you go this high, that's what I need... Well, I guess I wasn't paying attention. You want to gossip, or you want to do business...? If that were so? And what's the answer? Yeah, that's a good one. I know where I am. Your intel. Two men. Infil, exfil, hardware, and com. Well, you could, when you where in the Boy Scouts. Yeah.  ...you're out of your mind. ...that's what it costs...? Remember me...? ...well, I guess you do have friends in High Places...I mean here you are home, n'all... (he picks up now one, now another piece of exquisite statuary, and smashes it to the ground) And now we're gonna see if you also got all that money that you spoke of. (he takes out a videotape box) This here's a Short Subject, if you know what I mean. Of you in Carnal Congress with an Underage Girl. A PROSTITUE, A MINOR, AND SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER...  There's another...you know how cheap it is to make a copy...? I want what you promised me... Yeah, but you haven't made a deal with me...So, today is Your Lucky Day, cause you get to Do, what Most Men only Dream of: You get to make Another Human Being Happy.  You had your fun, now pay for it, Jim. Get your bank on the phone. We're going to transfer some money.  ...""how about that"". Yes. And that's the difference between you and me. ...and then?  ...""Jameson Construction""...They know we're there...?  Is that your experience...? Who took the photo? What does the bonus cost? Who else have you done a favor for, Avi? The last third on exfil, in Geneva. Me and the Girl. As agreed. What were you going to say...?  ...the Last Third in Geneva... ...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. It's good.  It's very good.  The charge takes the car out...  We got the flashbangs fore and aft, You hit the driver, follow down the driver's side, the car ain't going nowhere, the muscle gets out, I cap em, I go with the girl. (he points to Jones. He points to the car. Jones nods. To Smith) You exfil on your own, we're on to the airport. At the airport. When we hit the Conex. When you Seal Us In...you walk away. I cannot have heat on it. Now: I know: that you want to protect the package. But: you have to walk away. And que sera, sera.  ...it's an appleseed. ...yeah, I'm just a Man of Peace... Stay by me. I'm going to take care of you. You hold on, now. (as Scott drives he reloads his weapons) ...you remember, Baby, we went to high school together...  You dropped your earring. You're Picasso, right...? That's who you are... No, Baby, you're going Home.  You're just taking the long way home. ...I told you to stay on the bed. ...you're going travelling. ...we're going to take a little trip. ...put that away. Y'can't smoke it. American tobacco. Smell. Carry. In the desert air. Put that on. Over your head. Whole world likes Blondes. That's why you're here. Put the bandana on. Keep it together. (he takes a small hypodermic kit) Keep it together, or I'm gonna give you a shot and carry you out. ...that's right... They sent me...  ...that's right. One riot, one Ranger, you ever hear that? ...well, there you go. No. I think we went to different schools. ...put the bandana on. Yeah - I heard that one. I didn't ask you. You just keep it together.  You put this on. You... A little walk-in-the-park. (he points her to the News jet) See there...?  ...what was that...? ...what was your mistake...? I'm certain of it. No, no...come on baby...come on, come on girl: just walk to the plane: Just Get On the Plane...WALK TO THE PLANE... Shussh, baby... shussh... shussh... it's going to be alright... This's going to make Everything Allright... Laura...  No... Let the girl go home.  ...why can't the Girl Go Home? What is the Secret Knowledge? The girl ain't dead, baby, you're dead. You see: that's the difference. No, I just wanted to bring the girl back. That's right, she's safe. ...that's right, Baby..."
case_39,EMILY ,Ren�e Zellweger," And what you learned from your father now Diego's learning from you...? That really upsets you, doesn't it? A whole week without skipping school? Is that true? That's the last time I make a bet with you.  See you guys next week. You cut your hair. It looks great. No one is trying to steal your child, they found bruises and cigarette burns -- Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report -- well, if you feel you need legal representation that's perfectly within your rights... Thirty-eight. No, absolutely not, look at this, Wayne, look, I'm buried -- Don't fight. Hey, that's his. Be honest. The whole psychology thing, it's just about scoring chicks, isn't it? You know what freaks me out? I sit there talking to these families, you know, like I'm some expert. My family's a train wreck. I mean, I had this moment today where I realized I might be totally full of it. Hey Becca... No, it's me, it's just been a crazy couple weeks. You remember Doug. I'm sure I would, I just... If it were anyone, it'd be you. What are they doing to you? Emily Jennings. Child Services? We spoke on the phone...? Today is the seventeenth. I'm sorry, but it is. Friday was the fourteenth, that makes today the seventeenth. Monday the seventeenth. The date of our appointment. Come down, I'd like to meet you. My name's Emily. What's yours? Pretty name. Pretty girl.  Is there somewhere we can talk? When do you expect your husband back? Because we've found it's more beneficial if the whole family participates. Do you have any way of contacting him? Is that...? Would you ask him to join us? Would you ask him? It'll be okay. Hi, I'm Emily -- I'm here today because Lucy's school is concerned about changes they're seeing in her academic performance. The kinds of changes they're seeing are often associated with family problems. That's just it, many times a family won't even know they're having problems until it's too late. That's where we come in. We help families communicate and learn healthier ways of resolving conflict. Mr Sheridan, is there some reason you won't speak to me directly?  Is there some reason why your husband won't speak to me directly? I didn't say weird, I said scary. The guy sat there the entire time staring at me, the mother is like his emotional slave. Wayne, this girl's in trouble. I can feel it. Every time I talk to you you sound more like a lawyer, you know that? You put these files in front of me and you ask me to tell you what's going on. Well, I'm telling you, there's something going on and it's not something good. I've done my job, I've told you, what you do with it is yours.  Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've suddenly acquired the power of speech, doesn't it concern you a little that Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's in three months? So you have no idea why she's falling asleep at school every day? Why she's not able to sleep at home? He's gonna be having bad dreams when he gets hit with child endangerment.  Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's little girl routine? A little? Let me talk to her. Alone. She wants to talk. Five minutes. Talk to them about how much they love kids. I knew someone at school named Lucy, she was a writer. Do you ever write? I do sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm feeling. Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water up my nose. So much for establishing trust. What's happening to you? I can help. Let me help. What is it, sweetheart? I'm sure they don't hate you. What do they talk about? You've heard them say that? It's okay. You can tell him. He's on our side. She doesn't trust anybody. You think I made it up? I'm not giving up on her, Wayne. I hope you can live with a dead child on your conscience. So that's it? We let kids get killed until they rewrite the goddamn laws? Surprise, surprise. Mike, I'm desperate here. This girl heard her parents say they're going to send her to hell. The system is broken. What? Jesus, I feel like I'm talking to Wayne. You don't want to get involved, fine, but don't bullshit me, I'm running out of people I respect. Lucy. I just wanted you to know I haven't forgotten about you. I'm doing everything I can. You're not going to disappear. Lucy, wait... If anything happens, call me, okay? Just press this. Don't let your parents know you have it. I'm gonna get you out of there, I promise. It's me, thought you might be up, um, anyway, call if you get this. Too late, I met someone else...  Lucy? Are you okay? Why? Why are you scared, honey? Why are you sorry? Okay, listen, I want you to go over and open the window. Can you do that? Lucy...? Lucy, no, wake up!  Lucy...?! Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I told you about, I think she's in trouble - - yeah, I know what you said, but -- Mike, you're not listening --  HELP ME! Saving her life! They're not asleep. Did you hear that? Leave her alone! Did you hear that?! Break it down! BREAK IT DOWN! LUCY?! Oh my God... I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha... Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing your kid, Freudian dream analysis. Did they or did they not know what they were doing? That's the legal standard. They knew, they knew damn well!  Meaning what exactly?  Oh, that's great - what is this, late- night cable? Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing? Group therapy for kids, what's that say about the world? Good news. You get to leave here tomorrow. Only for a few days, till we find a better place. Oh, sweetheart. That would never be allowed. It's complicated, there's a whole process, I'm not even a foster parent... I'm sorry. Nothing? Hey, are you hungry? Let's get some lunch. What kind of food do you like? I can't, Lucy, it wouldn't work, I live in this tiny house, I... I'm sorry, I'm not mom material... I know what it feels like to be that age and be unwanted. It's terrifying. She needs to be with someone she trusts; she trusts me. So much of our time is spent negotiating red tape, I think if we just look at the situation - this one situation, this one child - it's clear what's best for her. I like to think of it as a glass-half- full situation. Kitchen. Bathroom. Fish. And here, is your room... Be okay? My family... well, I've met my dad twice and my mom's not a part of my life anymore.  Sometimes people have kids and then decide they don't want to be parents. I'm glad you're here. Chamomile, when I get stressed out it helps me sleep. None of this ever should have happened, if I could make it go away I would. I'm right down the hall if you need me. I have to grab some of her things, might take me a minute. I went by the house. I think her mom and dad were barricading themselves in their room at night. How sick is that? I'm coming around. Okay? This is your new beginning. I love you, too. Got it. What's up with Diego? Tell me what's going on. What happened? An eight-year-old did this? There's no way. Where is he now? You want to know what happened? I don't. I need to talk to him. Mike, please, I care about this kid. Diego... Let me in. He won't hurt me. What happened? Tell me what happened. It's just work. Don't worry. My job? I don't know, I guess... I guess maybe I want to believe families can work, so I can have my own someday, I don't know - does that make sense?  Breakfast. Honey, breakfa-- Come on, let me see... You went through my things? She used to just leave, she'd just...  ...and I never knew when she was coming back, or if she was... I used to think it was my fault and I would try so hard when she got home to be good, do everything I could think of, so she'd think I was `special' and stay next time or take me with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd always go away again, that's how it was. Gone, he left before I was born. First time I met him I was like thirteen. Oh, I had all these things I was gonna say. Angry things I'd thought of and kind of memorized. And um.... And then I met him and I wasn't angry, I was just sad and I told him...  I said, I love you, even if you don't love me. No... No, I'm not mad at you.  But I need you not to do that again, okay? Go through my private things without asking? Omelet's getting cold. Better hurry. You mean, to make sure I haven't missed anything else? She's not going back there, I'll take her out of state before I let them near her again. You wanted to talk about something? From who? What...? That's impossible. I might have called the week before...? Did you not hear me? I'm telling you, Mike, as a friend, I did not call that family. My backup files are in your room. Diego's is in there. Maybe you got curious and went through some, dialed a number? Mike, she said no. Maybe someone made a mistake. I believe you. Give me back my cases or fire me. Right now. I don't care if it's a hairline fracture, he broke her arm, I don't want him back in that house. He what? He found Christ? When? That recently? Uh huh. Well he should have found Him sooner. What's up?  How's it look? Do I have to beg or are you gonna tell me what's going on? She's `abnormally normal'? Why would she do that? No, I know, I just... The Martinezes' got a call Thursday night. From my house. She said she didn't. Mike thinks she's lying. I don't know what to think. Got you an extra in case it gets cold. I need to ask you something... about the night it happened... did you get a call, really late? You didn't? Diego, I know you did, they called from my house. What's the matter? What's scaring you? Oh God... It's okay... slow breaths... you'll be okay...  Can somebody help us down here?! Who called you? Was it Lucy? Did she say something to you? Something that scared you? `El' dijo? What do you mean, `He said'? It was a man? Well, photocopying isn't much fun. What...? This is weird. Diego said it was Lucy that called, but he called her a he, he said it was a man. Like what? What do I do with her in the meantime? No. Just tired. That's okay. Some other time. I said no, thank you. No. Doug? He says you're doing great. Nothing. Get some rest. Goodnight. I love you, too. See you next week. Did you try calling him? Cover my desk. Doug, it's me, it's Emily... Doug? Doug, you here? NOOOOO!!!!! Dr Johannsen? You did the autopsy on Doug Winters? How did he die? Friend.  I know the rules -- please, he meant a lot to me. You're saying he did that to himself? Oh come on. He looked like he'd been beaten to death! Don't tell me he was some - some suicidal...  ...I knew him! He was my best friend! Have you ever seen this before, somebody dying like this? It was an accident. It was nobody's fault. He was scared. He came out of that room with her, Mike, and he was scared. He said she threatened him. Diego said it was a man on the phone. You know who made that call. There was no one else in the house.  You think I don't know how crazy this sounds?! Why is he in that state of mind? Why was Doug? Pull my phone records. See if she called him. Her mother and father, their bedroom door has these deadbolts on it, big ones, two of `em... Something came through that door and they didn't want it ever coming through there again. Okay. I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now, but you're... You're the only one I can talk to. Lucy's been staying with me - A friend. I, ummm... What is she? Done with me how? Why me? I don't have anything. What does she want? What should I do? Nancy...?  Do you have a minute? Actually, that's why I'm here. I appreciate what you did for me, Nancy, I really do, but I think it'd be best if she was placed in foster care. I know, but it's not working out. I suppose not. Until when? How long is that going to take? I don't want her anymore. I'm done. That's it. How do I make it work if it's not working?  Thanks. Hi. Sorry, work - lost track of time. Lucky. Oh, it wasn't working... Who? How - how would I know that? I never said that. I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find somewhere that will take her. Tonight. I don't want this girl in my house. Mike. `No such thing as a bad kid, only bad parents.' I always believed that. It's a lie. Her parents aren't crazy. Aren't you? Why did she lie about calling him? Mike, you know I'm not crazy. Don't run away from something just because it scares you. I don't want her in group anymore, I don't want her around the other kids. You're never going back there. W-w-what's happening - ?! You're never going back there! No... Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let - that's not what I said - no, I did not - you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will you let me respond? - will you let me - Mrs Lynch - will you let - SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE WOMAN BEFORE I GET IN MY CAR AND COME OVER THERE AND BEAT YOUR ASS LIKE YOU BEAT YOUR SON! I HAVE YOUR ADDRESS! THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU CALL AND SWEAR AT ME! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE! I don't want to go home. I know I haven't been a great friend lately, but... do you think maybe I could crash here for a couple of nights? Tonight and tomorrow. LEAVE ME ALONE!!! Help me! Please! Let me on! She's coming! Please! Drive! DRIVE!  I... I had some things to catch up on... I saw a doctor.  They said mind your own fucking business! Wayne...? Hello...? Robin...  You did?  Oh God... I can't. I'm keeping her. If I get rid of her, if I put her into the system... I can't, Edward, I -- I don't have any faith. How... how do I...?  Mike...? She's taking me apart, Mike.  He told me I have to kill her. I'm not sleeping, I was hoping you could give me something. Lucy...? Oh my God... Who is this...? No... he's... I have to go. What did you do to him? WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?! Get out of my house. GET OUT! Stay away from me! STAY AWAY FROM ME!! No... Please... WHAT DO YOU WANT?!! Okay... okay, I will, I will, I promise. Okay... I'll be right there. I'll have one later. Tomorrow's our new beginning. I know. Get some rest. I love you. Forever and ever. Right down the hall. Sweetheart...? It's not real. Are you scared?! ARE YOU SCARED?! I'M NOT!! Where is she? Where'd they put her? Foster care? Is she with a family? You have to let me talk to them... Do you hear me?!"

I found you, you fuck. Who is this? * And we spoke earlier? I don't remember             * that.  Well, yeah, but it's not amnesia. I                * remember everything from before my injury, I just can't make any new memories. So I can't remember talking to you. What did we talk about?  Sammy Jankis. Yeah, I guess I tell people about Sammy to help them understand. Sammy's story helps me understand my own situation. Sammy Jankis wrote himself endless notes. But he'd get mixed up. I've got a more graceful solution to the memory problem. I'm disciplined and organized. I use habit and routine to make my life possible. Sammy had no drive. No reason to make it work. Me? I gotta reason. Natalie.  Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition - Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny. Then I probably told you how much I hated it. Could you take off your sunglasses?            * It's just hard for me -                         * So you have information for me? Yes. It is tough. Almost impossible. I'm sorry I can't remember you. It's not personal. You know him? Have I told you what this man did?                * Then you shouldn't have to ask. * So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.              * * The world doesn't disappear when you               * close your eyes, does it? My actions               * still have meaning, even if I can't                * remember them. My wife deserves                   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any                * difference whether I know about it.                * Why? She was beautiful. Perfect to me -                * You can only feel details. Bits and pieces which you didn't bother to put into words. And extreme moments you feel even if you don't want to. Put it together and you get the feel of the person, enough to know how much you miss them, and how much you hate the person who took them away. Deals? Sounds perfect? What do I owe you? Sorry. The Discount Inn, yeah.                         *  Don't remember. I met Sammy through work.  Insurance. I was an investigator. I'd              * investigate claims to see which ones               * were phony.                               * I had to see through people's bullshit. It was useful experience, because now it's my life. When I meet someone, I don't even know if I've met them before. I have to look in their eyes and just figure them out. My job taught me that the best way to find out what someone knew was to let them talk. Throw in the occasional ""why?"" but just listen. And watch the eyes, the body                * language. It's complicated. You might catch a sign but attach the wrong meaning to it. If someone touches their nose while they're talking, experts will tell you it means they're lying. It really means they're nervous, and people get nervous for all sorts of reasons. It's all about context. I was good. Sammy was my first real challenge. I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key. I don't see my key. What? This isn't my room? Then why is this my handwriting? Better tell me what the fuck's going on. When was I in here? Why? Why didn't you clean it out?                     * So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump? Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me. You don't have to be that honest, Burt. I'm gonna write that down. What time is it? I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy. Mr Samuel R. Jankis - strangest case ever. Guy's 58, semi- retired accountant. He and his wife had been in this car accident... nothing too serious, but he's acting funny - he can't get a handle on what's going on. The doctors find some possible damaqe to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive. But Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple minutes. He can't work, can't do shit, medical bills pile up, his wife calls the insurance company and I get sent in. My first big claims investigation - I really check into it. Sammy can think just fine, but he can't make any new memories, he can only remember things for a few minutes. He'd watch T.V., but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing, he couldn't remember how it began. He liked commercials. They were short. The crazy part was that this guy who couldn't follow the plot of ""Green Acres"" could do the most complicated things as long as he had learned them before the accident... ... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing. The doctors assure me that there's a real condition called Korsokoff's syndrome; short-term memory loss, rare but legit. But every time I see him I catch a look of recognition. Just a slight look, but he says he can't remember me at all. I can read people and I'm thinking bad             * actor. Now I'm suspicious and I order more tests. His wife has to do everything. Sammy can only do simple stuff. He couldn't pick up any new skills at all, and that's how I got him. Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back? Things change. Guess I've told you about my condition.  It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts. It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis? Who? Why? Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay? Why? Memory's unreliable. No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police, eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff. They collect facts, make notes, draw conclusions. Facts, not memories: that's how you investigate. I know, it's what I used to do. Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted and they're irrelevant if you have the facts. He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live. Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have. Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key. I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key. So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But I find something in my research: Conditioning. Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition. It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike, things you don't think about, you just get better through practice. Call it muscle memory, whatever, but it's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory. So I have the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning... Some of the objects were electrified, They'd give him a small shock. They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified. The point was to see if he could learn to avoid the electrified objects. Not by memory, but by instinct. Sorry. It's only me. Yeah. You? Useful. You never write a phone number on your hand?  It's great that you would... that you're helping me like this...  I'm sorry. They kept testing Sammy for months, always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge... Even with total short-term memory loss, Sammy should've learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects. All previous cases of short-term memory loss had responded to conditioning in some way. Sammy didn't respond at all. It was enough to suggest his condition was psychological not physical. We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness. Sammy's wife got stuck with the bills and I got a promotion for rejecting a big claim. Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless. But it works for me. I live the way Sammy couldn't. Habit and Conditioning. Acting on instinct. Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?  Who is he? What have you got me into? That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?! How do I know he did that to you? So I just take your word?  Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy. What? Course not. You have to burn them. There are things you know for sure. I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her. She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes. It's not easy to be calm when - I'm sorry. What happened? Who did he go to meet? What do the police think? Kill him. I don't even know how long she's been              * gone. It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here because she's gone to the bathroom or something. But somehow I just           * know that she'll never come back to bed.            * I lie here, not knowing how long I've been alone. If I could just reach out and           * touch her side of the bed I could know             * that it was cold, but I can't. I have no            * idea when she left.                            * I know I can't have her back, but I want            * to be able to let her go. I don't want to wake up every morning thinking she's still here then realizing that she's not. I want time to pass, but it won't. How             * can I heal if I can't feel time? Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him and fighting the company's decision - but it wasn't the money that got to her. I never said that Sammy was faking. Just that his problem was mental, not physical. But she... she couldn't understand. She looks into his eyes and sees the same person. And if it's not a physical problem... ... he should just... snap out of it. So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt, just like he gave it to the doctors. But I never said that Sammy was faking. I never said that. Awake. Where am I? Motel room. Some anonymous motel room. Nothing in the drawers, but you look anyway. Never anything but the Gideon... ... Bible. Just a minute! Teddy! Why are you here? You don't know him? I don't think so. I might have fallen asleep before I did. What's your name? Your name. Who did this to you? Who did this to you? No. No, just let me think for a minute. Here we go. Why? We've got to get him out of here. We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding. I don't know. Yes I do... this isn't my room. It's his. He was already here. Let's just           * go.                             * It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun. Which one? Shut it, Teddy. I'll ride with him. You follow. Take your own car. Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him. What's wrong with this one? I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about. Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd? What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that you can't bully someone into remembering... the more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.  Then call me back. Don't feel drunk. Not just now! Ah, it's a message for Teddy...                   * I'm at the MOUNTCREST INN on 5th Street, Room 6, and I need you to come over as soon as you get this, it's important. This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye. I'll get the jump on you, fucker. Is this the guy? Fuck! Sorry. Need a weapon. What the fuck am I doing? Chasing him! FUCK! He's chasing me.  Don't be too hard on yourself. Seat belt. What the fuck am I doing? Chasing him! How can you read that again? You've read it a hundred times. Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next - Probably tried this before. Probably burned truckloads of your stuff. Can't remember to forget you. Do I know this guy? He seems to know me. What the fuck! Thanks. Interested in buying one? I forget.  I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. Who is this?  Honey?  Honey? It's late. Everything okay? Are you okay in there?! No. That would have been worse. I'd like you to leave now. Well, sir, that would certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries. Yeah, I was hoping to get more on the drugs angle. Hang on a second. The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house. The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it, along with some of his stuff. And I think there's something...  Something about a syringe...  I've got a copy of the police report. It has lots of information, but with my condition, it's tough. I can't really keep it all in mind at once. Yeah, and there's pages missing... I guess I've been trying to log them all.  The police gave me the report themselves. I dealt with them a lot in my insurance job, and I had friends in the department. They must have figured that if I saw the facts of the case, then I would stop believing that we needed to find John G. They weren't even looking for John G. The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened, so they didn't chase any of it up. None? Okay, blonde. Yeah, blonde is fine. Discount Inn, 304. Leonard.                      * It's simple, you just go to the bathroom. No, you just go into the bathroom. We go to bed, you wait till I fall asleep, then you go into the bathroom and slam the door. Just loud enough to wake me up. That's it. But, first I need you to put these things around. Just pretend these things are yours, and this is your bedroom. No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something. No! No, don't use it, you, I mean it's... you just have to put it where you would if it were yours. The drugs stashed in the car doesn't ring true for me. The police figure the guy was an addict needing money to score, but I'm not convinced. He's not gonna be breaking in when he's still got a stash that big.  I think John G. left it or planted it.  Well, it was a lot for one guy's personal use.  How do you know that?  Right, that's true. It fits.  Too much for personal use, so he deals. Who the fuck are you? Prove it. What are you doing in my car? Unfinished business. Who's she? Why's that? What do you mean ""bad news""? Why should I care? From who? Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you? Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 Why are you following me? Happy now? Why? What sort of questions? Like what? I have money. My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered. Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran - I didn't sell - Yeah, well, thanks for the advice. Fuck it. I need my own place. I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously. This is a difficult condition for people to understand. I mean look at Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal with it.   MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99  I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it?  It got much worse than that. Eventually Sammy's wife came to see me at the office, and I found out all kinds of shit.  She knew that I was the one who had built he case for Sammy faking it. She told me about life with Sammy, how she'd treated him. It had got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. She wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old Sammy back. Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is ""faking"" anything, just that his condition can't be shown - We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal. Then why are you here? Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?  I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories. She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her. I thought she just needed some kind of answer. I didn't think it was important to her what the answer was, just that she had one to believe. What happened? Who? Why? Calm down.  Take it easy. You're safe now. You're safe. Let's get some ice on your face. And what did he say? Where is he? I'll go see him. Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.  My wife used to call me Lenny. Yeah, I hated it. I'll take care of it. Just tell me what he looks like, and where I can find him. Do you have a pen? Me? Why would he be interested in me? Why would you do that? Just write it all down. What he looks              * like, where I find him.                         * No, she shouldn't have given me that responsibility. Shit, I'm not a doctor, I'm a claims investigator. I suppose, but I've got all sorts of other considerations. Legal responsibility, and large financial... Who is this? What's wrong? Who? What does he want? Did you? What's this all about? I have this condition - What happened? Neither do I. I'm not. How? What? What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money. That's different. Don't talk about my wife. Calm down. Just take it easy, this isn't my fault. Yes. Shut the fuck up! Don't say another fucking word! What happened? Front desk? Burt, right. Well, this is Mr. Shelby in Room 21. I don't want any            * calls, none at all, got it? Thanks.                * * Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -            * They're not looking for him. They don't think he exists. I told them what I remembered. I was asleep, something woke me up... Her side of the bed was cold. She'd been            * out of bed for a while. There had to be a second man. I was struck from behind, I remember. It's about the last thing I do remember. But            * the police didn't believe me.                              * John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.                         * Thank you. Oh, one thing. Something to remember you by. What's wrong? Yeah? That's right I did, didn't I? A cop? * I'm not too good on the phone. I need to            * look people in the eye when I talk to              * them.                                * Thanks.  Nobody's perfect. My wife. Dying. I remember my wife dying. Beer, please. A BEER, please. There's a dress code? I'm meeting someone called Natalie. Oh. But haven't we met before? So why am I here? I don't remember. See, I have no short-            * term memory. It's not amnesia -                   * How do you know about me? Who's your boyfriend? Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss. My name's Leonard.                             * I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry. I can't make new memories. Everything              * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before. Found it in my pocket. Thank-you. Mrs. Jankis came to my off ice and asked            * my honest opinion about Sammy's                   * condition.                                * I never said he was faking. Just that his condition was mental, not physical. She seemed satisfied, she just said ""thanks"" and got up to leave. I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam. She knew beyond doubt that he loved her, so she found a way to test him. She really thought she would call his bluff... ... or didn't want to live with the things she'd put him through. She went into a coma and never recovered. Sammy couldn't understand or explain what had happened. He's been in a home ever since. He doesn't even know his wife is dead. Now I know. You take it. If you think you're supposed to recognize someone, you pretend to. You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors. You bluff it to seem less of a freak.                 * Didn't know this town had a parlor. I'd like this on my thigh please. Promise you won't call me an idiot. How'd you know I was in here? Guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind. It'll be alright for a minute. Why? Why not? Envelopes?                                * How do you know this? How do you know him? Who?  Sneaky fuck. ""Bad Cop"". Had me going. So this Jimmy Grantz deals drugs out of            * the bar where his girlfriend works. But            * he'll come to the meet alone.                    * Officer Gammell. Something to remember you by. I'm sorry - is it Officer, or Lieutenant Gammell? You're not coming? Jimmy? Do you remember me? You Jimmy Grantz?                              * Strip! Don't say anything else. Quiet! Pants, too. I don't want blood on them. Strip! You think you can bargain with me?! I don't want your fucking money! I want my fucking life back!  Hey! Mister! I need help! There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!  He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you? Maybe. Maybe just. I don't know. See, I have this condition. Remember me again, huh? Who was that? He's not the guy. He knew            * me.                             * So what was he bringing the two hundred            * grand for?                                * This is a drug deal?! You're using me! He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?                              * What the fuck are you talking about? That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy - Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !                    * I never said he was faking! I never said that! I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and - My wife wasn't diabetic. She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't             * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong            * with you?                            * But he's not the right guy!                      * It makes all the difference.                     * Yes, I will. Somehow, I'll know! When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different! Why do you keep lying to me?                     * So who are you saying he was?                    * You probably.                             * Why would I do that?                            * Your name's Teddy. I should kill you.                             * I'm not a killer... ... but right now I need to be. Maybe I'm not finished yet. Maybe I need to be sure that you won't ever use me again. You're a John G.? Fine, then you can be my John G. Do I lie to myself to be happy? In your case, Teddy... yes, I will. It is now. Why not? I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a murderer. I'm gonna hang on to this. I have to believe in the world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there.  But do I? Do I believe the world's still there? Is it still out there?!  Yes. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different. Now... where was I?"

Here you go Bri'. Got a couple a bags of chips and some jerky, just holler if you want some. Can't hurt. Forget it.  Shush, Adele. Forget about it Bri'. I wouldn't be surprised if that Karma thing don't come back and get him.  Nope... You? Thanks Bri', I'll get the next one.  Think it's time we hit the sack. Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper. Which one. Only if they let me put mine down too. Bri'. She wasn't feeling so good.  Nah... Don't eat breakfast. Never have. Well don't be, I got plenty more where this one came from. ...Need a hand with those bags? I got 'em.  This the book your writing? This guy killed a mess of people. Henry Lucas. Wonder what all them people done made him so mad? Here Bri' let me do that. How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?  Hey Bri'... ah... You don't want to go in there. It's a real mess, if you know what I mean. ...Then some. Call it an even thirty. I'll drive Bri'. Adele, get in the back. ...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh? Now why is that? You don't sound too convinced 'bout that? That your... ""theory"", ain't that what they call it? You wanna hear mine? Ain't you goin' to record it?  Well I'll just bet he's still alive. Old, livin' in some trailer park or somethin' somewhere, but still alive. Thinkin' every night 'bout what he done. Goin' over and over it in his mind. How smart he was for getting away with it. You ever play any pool Bri'? I wonder if there's any ""doors"" out here? You know... ""openings"" to other dimensions.  I read there are a lot of them out West, mostly in the desert. They say if you know what you're doing, you can travel anywhere in the Universe in a matter of seconds. Wouldn't that come in handy? Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know. Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game. Nah... how much money have you got?  You'd better hit him first Bri', 'cos it's comin'. Hit him.  Bri' this shit ain't Lucky Lager! Got to see a man about a mule. Gotta take a piss. Any reebs left in the back seat? Aaahhhhh...  That's what we used to call a beer when we was kids... Beer spelled backwards. ...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it. Hey, that's what buddies are for, right...?  You know those doors I was talking about? Found two of them back in Kentucky. Shit, I wasn't even looking for one the first time. Me and the boys are just swingin' our sickles by the side of the road, and I turned around and there it was... this door with this bright blinding white light all around it... course I'm thinkin' I must be sunstroked or somethin'... so I close my eyes figurin' I'll count ten and it'll be gone right... so I'm countin'...  ...1-2-3-4-5... an' I'm 'bout ta piss myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10. An' I open my eyes slow, spectin' it won't be there right...  ...and it wasn't. For... 'bout three years. Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight? Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that? I can feel it start to run down my neck... (he turns his back to show her) ...and down my back... right into my pants. ...and everything starts stickin' together... keeps running down the back of my legs like two rivers racin' for my boots, see who gets there first. You never get that hot, huh? ...never? You like Skynard? Only thing my old man ever gave me is that goddamn .45. Bri', you're jerkin' it when you pull the trigger, hold it real steady. Steady... Breath in... now let half of it out, and... fire. Bri, I want you to keep this gun... consider it a present. Never know, California could turn out to be a dangerous place. Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta. I ain't ridin' in no bus... bitch. You just sit there and keep your mouth shut. I knew that boy'd have a hogleg here somewhere. Get over here. Sit your ass down in that corner. Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now! What's your name, boy? Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that? I don't know. Wish I did. Shut your mouth. Where you from Walter? Never heard of it, any huntin'? Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think... Tell you what Walter, you lie down there now... You make sure you stay put for a while after we leave... Okay? What do you need a Bible for? You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it? Here you go.  I wonder if Adele would like one of these?  Nah...  What the fuck!  'Fraid not Bri'... Drive Adele. Hate to be an Indian-giver but I'm gonna have to ask for my gun back. Everybody just shut up! You two just cooperate and do what I say, and we'll all arrive safe and sound in California, as planned... unless, of course, Adele don't kill us first with her driving. What the hell is this stuff? Yeah but, what is it? And just what exactly are the Chinese doing here in the middle of the American desert anyway?... Didja get the beer? ...""Chink"" beer! Oh hell, I'm sorry Bri. Adele, honey, untie Brian, he's starving over there.  Carrie, you want some? Where's the damn forks and spoons at! ...Is it just me, or has this whole trip been goin' downhill ever since we ran outta Lucky Lager? Well now, how many people d'you see me kill? ...Well then, that's how many I killed. Damn right I do. You never killed anyone have you Bri'? You never even seen anybody killed, right? You wanna tell me how'n the hell you gonna write a book 'bout somethin' you don't know nothin' 'bout? Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!  ...watch out for that stuff, it bites. No way. I guarantee you he was breathing when I walked outta there. Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri? Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table. Figured your hands might be starting to hurt. Let's have a look. You girls coming? Don't worry Bri', I'll take the pictures. (to Adele, with a kiss to her cheek) ...you stay here with Carrie.  You run off... Bri' pays the price. Karma, remember? So tell me... what happened here?  ...and? Where'd they do it? Bri. This ain't going to give me nightmares, is it? Do what Bri? You want to know about my daddy, I'll tell you about my daddy, Bri... Tell me that don't hurt. Shoot him. You'll be doing him a favor. It's the answer to all them questions of yers. Now you'll never know. I know that. That there is a policeman in a world of pain. And this is what you call a mercy killin'. I'm still waiting.  Not so much as a simple ""thank you."" Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele? Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!  Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?  Hey Bri... You ever stop to think that if you switched the two letters in your name...  ...it would spell Brain. What's wrong with her? I'll bet she did. Where's your husband?  Well 'Peaches'... you're a widow now.  Have you seen this one? That don't leave much to the imagination now does it?  That's you ain't it? Well they say there's room fur all kinds in California... and that's where we're gonna be this time tomorrow. California.  Adele honey? Adele?  Peaches! Come on back here. There ain't nothin' for you to be afraid of.  Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches! Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!!  Honey... What do you think you're doin'? Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit. You two been busy in here. Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman. Sorry about this Bri... Think anyone will notice? I'll bet there's a 'door' out there... save us some time. Pass me a beer hon'. You wanna hit me with that, huh? Stop lyin'... I can see right through you. Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think... I seen the way you been lookin' at me since we met... Snappin' my photo when you thought I wasn't lookin'. Wanting me... I saw you when I killed that boy...  You were plenty hot. Sick... some people might say takin' photos of me and Adele humpin' in the back of the car is sick. ...You know what I mean? That's better... Honesty... I like that in a woman. But I'll tell ya... when we get to California, we're gonna have to do something 'bout that gutter mouth of yours. Come on. Howdy, my name's Early Grayce and this is my girl Carrie. I hope you don't mind us bargin' in like this but a... we was on our way to California when our car broke down, and... Well... it's gettin' pretty rough out there, so if it's all the same to you, we'll be staying the night.  You'll like it... Not a lot, but you'll like it. I knew there was doors out here!  That was damn tricky of you Bri. Go ahead Bri, ask me something.  You wanna know how I'm feeling'? Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn good. How 'bout you? You feelin' good? ...'Cause you sure don't look so good.  Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful. That it, you feeling powerful? Superior? I know I am. What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now why would I be angry with my daddy... you're the one hit me with the shovel. And you're the one's gonna wish you hadn't. Hey Bri... I think I need a doctor. What d'ya say?"
chronicle,ANDREW ,Dane DeHaan," What do you want, I'm getting ready for school- You're drunk- It's seven thirty. In the AM. You're drunk, dad, that's crazy- I'm filming this. I bought a camera. I'm filming all your shit from now on. Mom? Will you say hi to the camera? The millions of people watching at home. No, you look great. Oh yeah, definitely. Oh, yeah, thanks. I'm filming things now. I'm filming everything. For my mom. I'm trying to get custody of her from my dad. She's getting worse, and he's not...helping, and this way, in case something goes down- Right, it'd be evidence. Well, yeah, to add context. What is that? For school? Yeah, right. Are you not coming in? You're going to miss first period- Okay, okay. This is my school, I guess.   This is the hallway- ...yeah- Bryce, gimme my camera back- Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-  Oh come on... This is where I eat lunch, out here on the bleachers. Hey- I wasn't, videotaping you, so much as I was just- ...okay. Yes. I thought Haven Hills was closed. Why are you telling me? ...Nah... I don't like parties. Yeah? It has a purpose- I'm uploading what I shot today...you have to keep a back-up, you know. Are you sure it's here?  Are you sure it's here, this all looks closed- Oh yeah. What? What am I supposed to do? I thought you said you didn't want to go alone- Oh, I don't- just filming. What? No, I wasn't filming anyone specific, just filming the party. Okay. Okay-  What- STEVE Are you Andrew-with-the-camera?  Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a camera? I'm Andrew. No, I know. Everybody knows who you are. What?   I don't- I don't- Look, I don't think we're supposed to- Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know- What were you guys doing out here? This is way out- Matt's out here? The what? You remember that? STEVE Yeah, I have a memory for faces. I'm gonna go into politics, which is ironic because I'm soooo fucking high right now- probably shouldn't be letting you videotape this- I'm gonna be so rich when you're president, you have no idea- Matt? We're not supposed to be out here. Guys- Guys, just don't like- don't push me, or do anything like that- ...It's like, whispering? Singing? What is that? I don't know, probably...I mean, it's- it's kinda loud, right? No, I don't- I mean, I won't do th- Hey, wait- Hello- Does it go down much deeper, or- Do you think it could be like wind, or- Then what do you think it is? Who said anything about ghosts. Steve's up ahead- I don't know what you're talking about. No. I don't wanna film it, it's messing with the camera- Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't... WHAT? I can't hear you over the- you know- Rolling, yeah. Ah, shit. The trick is to pretend like it's on a plate. You get it on the plate and then you wrap the plate around it, and you can move it however you want. Yeah?   Plate's easier for me. Try to imagine that your squeezing the entire piece in your hand.  Really? Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together. Because we're his mistress. I told you, it's just my thing for right now. Maybe I want a barrier. My dad is actually a fireman, or was, I don't know. He got injured like two years ago, and now they just pay him out of, like, insurance. He doesn't do anything, I mean he goes out during the day, but I don't know where. He drinks a lot. I do computer repair, and stuff.     I actually make a lot of money... My mom has spinal meningitis, she's- she can't work or anything, and the insurance doesn't cover all of her medicine, so a lot of my money has to go into that. I figure if I get enough on camera, maybe I can, I dunno, get custody of her or something. Yeah? ...That's intense. How- Haha no of course, no way. Ew- Couldn't that metaphor just be for any muscle in the human body, like working out or- I think it's time we took this out of the backyard. Matt and Steve look confused. I got it. I got this. One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the little boy. The little boy is wowed. The teddy bear suddenly takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled laughter. Umm...  Got him. Hey Matt.  Do you like me? Why not? You're an asshole.  You know, you...If you hadn't invited me to that party, none of this would've happened. Thanks. Yeah, until all those chicks showed up. Are you sure there's no one around- You just need focus, Matt. You're lucky you got the kleenex, I'm stuck with the taco bell wrapper. Her face, I can't get her face out of my head.  Here, take the camera, take the camera. Abracadabra. I didn't mean to, I didn't- Guys, just calm down, I'm sorry, okay- You don't have to- I mean I can- Are you mad? Is he okay? Is that the cops, are you calling the cops? I don't see how you guys can be so angry- He was being an asshole- he- I didn't mean to- Then what've we been doing, we've been fucking around- I- You can't just declare rules, you're not- MATT I will fucking declare rules, okay? If we keep going, and getting stronger, we need rules. We need rules.  Damn it Andrew turn off the cam- Did he say what it was about?   When he called, what did he say? Are you still mad at me?  You seem mad. What does that even mean? ...I understand. That doesn't look easy. Let me try- Whoaaaamygod...whoaaa... Guys, do you hear that? What?   I can't hear you!  Y- yeah- I CAN FLY!  No. That's so cool. Doesn't that count as breaking rule #1 though? I haven't had sex since ever. YO. Yeah. I feel stupid now that I was scared to come back. Well, uh, it would appear that a Virgin Mary has appeared in the maple syrup on a young local man's pancake. Fuck you, pig. What's that mean? So what, you wanna do like, a charity? That's lame. I dunno. Name something you're bad at. Say hi for me. So? You still haven't told her? And it's bad, because her pain gets real bad, you know, and we can't afford the good meds anymore. When I was little it wasn't as bad, but even then dad was still, you know, the way he is. I don't know. I don't know anymore. I don't know how to feel. CUT. I hope so. No, I- I mean, no, that's not- I'm really shy, and I don't have any talents, or-  ...Oh, no way. No way- Yeah, Steve chose my clothes, he's gonna do my hair. Oh yeah, me too. I don't know what you mean- Matt. ...I'm sorry, I'll try to- You really think so- Yeah, it did- it did feel like that. All the girls screaming- What's that? What's ""hubris?"" What ""seriously,"" fuck you seriously! Hey Matt.  What's ""seriously"" mean? Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time practicing- What? Oooh, oh yeah, your hair was different; it was blue, right? MONICA Yeah! Monica, yeah-  Mom, it's going to be okay, okay? Just try to get through, it's going to be okay. What'd you...You- what'd you see? I didn't spend any of your money, RICHARD- School doesn't cost any money, I go to public school you idiot-  You asshole, you fucking crazy asshole- Where's Matt? Where's Matt? No! ...My dad- You don't give a shit, stop acting like you care! ...What?  I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh god, I'm sorry- Yeah, yes, I don't know what I'm doing- I've been busy. ...No. MATT Turn off the camera. I was upset. I don't know- I don't know- I don't. I'm not lying, I don't know what happened- No, why-  -wanted to show you what I was talking about. See, it's- I put a little sheet between myself and the knife, and the barrier, the sheet, is too strong. The knife can't cut it. I mean like, what I'm saying is if I concentrate, I can't be hurt. I can't be injured. Because of the little sheet. Hey Wayne! See, this one, I got clean, cause I did a little lasso around the root, but these two, they're broken cause I think I pulled them from the middle. Matt was always better at the little, the intricate stuff, he got good at that. See how broken it is, ugh, sloppy. No, I'm filming this. I film everything. What did you want to talk about? It's not doable. Financially, they're not- I mean, my dad didn't go to college either. I don't need college, Mr. Fernandez. I've been doing a lot of reading, like you know, online, about evolution, and the way it works, and you know, natural selection. The uh...  The strongest animals will always survive, and they're the ones that you know, will prosper, or grow, and survive, by feeding on the smaller animals. And as humans we- see, there's...uh-  There's this thing called an Apex Predator, and basically what that is the most powerful predator in an ecosystem. And humans, you know, we're the apex predator, because there's nothing that preys on us, cause of weapons and stuff. But if something could, I bet it would. I...  I mean, what I'm trying to say is, a lion doesn't feel guilty when it kills a gazelle. You don't feel guilty when you squash a fly, you know- I think that means something. I think it really means something. That's rude. Why?   Your life's great- You don't need to worry about me. I'm stronger than ever now. I can lift a whole car by myself. I could fucking crush this entire house, I'm fine. So what? I think you should go. I have to pick up my mom's medication. You'd have to what. You were always the weakest. You couldn't do shit to me. I'm not gonna break your stupid fucking rules, just fuck off and stay out of my life. I'm here to pick up a prescription for Sandra Detmer. That's right. I have to come back. PHARMACIST Okay, we'll hold it for you.  Bang.  WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!? The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his seatbelt with him. CASEY No NO NO  No one's gonna help me...No one's gonna help me now...  What type of camera is that?"
alien,STANDARD ,Nah,"  Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to. But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.  No, I told him to be out in ten minutes.  It's been much longer. Let's get him out of there. The line's slack.  Christ, do you think the idiot unhooked himself? There, it caught! No, it's coming. No, I can't see far enough.  The line's moving, though. I can see him!  Here he comes! Get ready to grab him! Look out!  There's something on his face! Don't touch him, watch it! Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off. It won't come -- it's stuck. How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!  Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!  Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.  Martin, are you there?  We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.  It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.  You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.  We can't leave him out here, open the door.  Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!  You men stay clear, there's a parasite on him. I don't know but don't touch it. Give us a hand here, let's get him up to the Autodoc. Help me, come on, let's get him up here. It wouldn't come. Medical gloves. It's really on there tight.  Stop it, you're tearing his face. Let's let the machine work on him. Ask him. Good. He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him. Let's look inside his head. You're right... we can't stand here and do nothing.  Somebody give me a scalpel.  I've made an incision... it's not reacting... but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound...  Hold it, this stuff's smoking! That stuff's eating right through the metal!  It's going to eat through the decks and right out through the hull! There!  Look!  There.  Should be coming through about there. It's stopped? We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken weeks to patch it. No, thank God... just missed him.  It appears to have healed itself. I don't see how.  But let's do what we can for him. I think we'd better get some intravenous feeding started.  God knows what that thing is leaching out of him. What film? I personally can't make any sense out of it... That sounds a little fanciful...  I'll do it.  The rest of you continue. You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo. Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous. Maybe it wasn't always dead. The door was closed.  It must still be in here. No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping. Maybe we can catch it. As long as we're careful not to damage it...  Shit! I think it's dead. Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him. Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme something to grab it with! Christ!  Let's get it out of here! How's Broussard? Still unconscious? Can you do anything for him? Good.  I need some coffee.  I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here. I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines. They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile. Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best. What? Switch on tractor beams. Lock tractor beams. Retract landing struts. Take us up. Switch on lifter quads. Engage artificial gravity. Let's take her into an escape orbit. Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all! You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive. Quit complaining; we're in space. I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies. That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.  How do you feel, Dell? Don't you remember? Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back! We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.  I think that's a pretty reasonable request.  The commander normally has first publication rights. Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean. What's wrong? Breathe deeply. We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship. We've got about a week left, right? All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time. So does anybody have any suggestions? No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out. Room by room, corridor by corridor. We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it. Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change. I thought I'd find you here. That's the one about the albatross, right? We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us. I can see you're putting your spare time to good use. (leans forward and taps him on the knee) Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen. Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.  I hope not. How do we locate the creature? These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear? For starters, let's make sure the bridge is safe. All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team. We'll all carry communicators.  We want to keep in constant touch.  We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!  Food-storage room! It started crashing around right after we locked it in. I guess we open the door and net it. It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.  Don't be an idiot. Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all. Get those masks on. Go ahead, Jay. Shut it off. What do you think?  Now we go in. Then let's go and do it. So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out. The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out. The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him. While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net. Got a better idea? Let's be democratic. Martin, take one. Open it up, Cleave. Yeah, we're getting into position. Right now let's keep it closed. Are they close? Let's get moving with this net. All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?  And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?  Yes!  Okay, our screens show you as being near to the opening.  We'll open it up, then we'll cue you and you can start blasting.  That'll drive it right out.  You don't have to go any farther. Okay, get ready. Open the vent, Sandy.  How did it get so big?  Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's huge now. We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. (throws a switch; circuitry lights up)  What's that supposed to mean? That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock. No, I don't want us separated. All right... but do not go below decks. And be right back.  Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me. That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker. Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals... Which presumably means...  What? We've got six hours left. Does anybody know what happened? Can we get to him? At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship. I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers. It's time for drastic remedies. That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild. Let's hear it. That'll blow the ship up. But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed. No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive. But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow. If we could just get the creature into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up. We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space. You can't say that; I think it's a good plan. Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving. I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're portable, and they can be radio detonated. Here, carry these.  It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it. Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.  You can come up!  It's safe! The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back. No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.  Along the base of the walls there. It will be. Well... now we have to herd that thing up here. Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured. All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator. And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and -- Come on; we haven't much time, air is a factor.  We've got something on the tracker... got to be it, it's too big for the cat. Let me go first; you stay behind me. I can't, the acid will pour out!  Kill me...  Look...  That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... No... don't... No good... it's eaten too much of me... Kill me..."
oblivion,JACK ,Tom Cruise," They arrived almost half a century ago. Aliens, Scavs, whatever you want to call them. Their idea of how-do-you-do was to blow up our moon. Without her moon, the earth went insane. Most were killed in the floods, as the cities came down, as everything caught fire. A year later their ground troops landed, to exterminate whoever was left. A station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow. A child's plastic flip-flops on the dash. They were probably surprised, what we were willing to do, to survive. We used the nukes. Humanity had to flee the Earth. We had to unlearn what it meant, to call something our home. Now we live on the Tet, our man-made moon. A temporary home before the next step. Everyone's there now. Yeah, I got 'em. You got 'em, Bob? The Bobblehead bobs. Oh, you know. Same ole' same. In front of Victoria, almost a hundred years of technological advances. Most prominent a MAP overlaid with environmental, meteorological, radiation levels... Other screens stream cam-footage from the Bubbleship. You should come with me sometime. What do you call this? What does a storm look like inside a storm? Like this. The WALL OF WEATHER comes out of the wind and rain from behind Jack's ship, simply eats it up. Suddenly Jack's going end over end, helpless. Warning lights flash. Jack punches controls that won't respond.  ""I've got sunshine... on a cloudy day. When it's cold outside I've got the month of May..."" Victoria watches the readouts, helpless.  ""Talkin' 'bout my girl..."" Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of RESOURCE-GATHERERS on the horizon. Essentially titanic vacuums, sucking up the oceans. In front of her console, VICTORIA charts the Gatherers, and the patrol arcs of their defensive Drones. One blinks, stalled. Send it. NUMBERS FIRE across the heads-up. Jack touches a button. A BAR GAUGE begins to fill, like a street racer turning on the NOX before dragging... I see it, looks like full mid- flight impact. What was its last destination? BELOW, through blowing dust, we see a DRONE, a spherical mechanical weapon, plunged into the sand. You know, I actually read about this game. Giants are literally on their own seven with 25 seconds on the clock... Anyway... QB lets off this mile- high bomb... The weather's fast and erratic like this. As Jack starts moving towards the Drone, a heavy mist forms, shrouding it in grey. There's almost no sound, just Jack's feet on earth... The thing just sails the length of the field. Victoria anxiously checks a screen, the arc of the Tet's ""vision"" still not covering Jack's location. And at the one yard line... interception. Devastation. It's all over. But the guy's too eager. He starts running it back. Everyone's yelling ""Fall down, just fall down!"" Jack goes to his knees, examining it, his hands expertly locate an empty tube-like space on the side of the Drone. Huh... The fuel-cell has been taken. No... It's a master drone, too. 166. Looks like it was hit mid flight, managed to limp its way here. Watch my back, I'm starting field repair. INTERCUT: VICTORIA AT SKY TOWER. Glances at the arc of the Tet's vision - still six minutes away. Bob, I'm going to need a cell. AT THE BUBBLESHIP. An exterior compartment opens revealing spare parts, etc... At the same time, a small ROVER, an ball-shaped independent gopher, rolls free from the ship, sprouting wheels... So the guy keeps running. 30, 40, 50 yards and BAM! He gets pasted. Ball goes loose...  Bob, I said I needed... He turns to find that the ROVER is already there, a DEUTERIUM FUEL CELL sitting in its payload bay. A SOUND now reaches Jack. Distant, an animal in pain? Jack listens, but it's gone. He slots the cell. A HUMMMM as the Drone powers up, systems coming online. Jack looks around at the stadium. Can you imagine it? 80,000 people on their feet. Everyone yelling ""Go! Go! Go!..."" Touchdown... He sets his gun against the Drone, raises his arms, running in a circle, making the crowd roar sound... ""Yahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... ."" Hey there, boy. Easy... Jack moves forward, hand out. You got nothing to be scared of, buddy... The dog suddenly SCURRIES away into the dark BEHIND JACK, a HUGE FORM RISES. We see GREY SKIN, TEETH... and Jack hears ITS HEAVY LABORED BREATH... Ah, shi... JACK SPRINTS, full speed! The animal, A GIANT EMACIATED HAIRLESS BEAR, comes SURGING out of the darkness, lumbering after him. Jack TEARS back down the tunnel, the bear's form almost FILLING the tunnel behind him. I'll see you at the house later. You want anything? Milk? Bread? Anything else that doesn't exist? Well if you want anybody else, you're out of luck. He boards the BUBBLESHIP. No... ON JACK. The captured Drone data right there in front of him on the heads-up. He's too curious. That Master Drone was hit right over mid-town. Same area as the one we lost last night. One day when we get to Mars, someone will want to know about this. From someone who was here. He stares at the HUGE columns of water draining upwards. Do we have to take it all? Actually I've got a bit of a problem with a gyro here, call you when I've fixed it. He releases a catch, pulls a WHITE RECTANGULAR CASE from a slot in the Bubbleship. He kneels down, hands working expertly, producing a full UNFOLDING MOTORCYCLE. As Jack locks the rear wheel in place, the bike HUMMS to life. He gets on and opens up the throttle, rooster- tailing off. The bike's electric, but it MOVES. .There you are. An instant of BLACK... And we're suddenly looking at Jack THROUGH ALIEN BINOCULARS. High tech, symbol readouts changing. Something is watching him. Vika, you're not going to believe... WHITE NOISE on the comm. There's no signal down here. .Jackpot. Goodnight, folks... See you back here tomorrow. Same time, same channel... He punches the throttle, and screams across the tops of the clouds through the beautiful light, arriving at... No. I'm not supposed to bring them in the house. He's right. He exchanges his water for a glass of something stronger, and goes and sits down. You're right. Ah-ha. So it's okay when I bring you something. But if I -- She MOVES suddenly, opening one of the glass doors of the Sky Tower and heading outside where she holds the seedling away from her body, off the edge, lets it drop. Was that really necessary? It was just a plant, Victoria. Hit me. She activates the wand, shines ultra violet light onto the substance. A beat, then he BENDS OVER in pain. Through the healant we see the FLESH begin to knit and repair. Skin and sinew literally regenerating... to new. Look, they trained me to fix drones. That's my job, I get that. But it's not what I am. I can't simply do the same thing over and over again, every day, with that... world down there.  And if mission has a better Drone tech, they can get him to baby- sit. He gets up, tries out his leg. Stiff, but healed. Pretty soon, there won't be anything left down there. No more plant life, no more water. So forgive me if I want to enjoy it a little before the end. Actually, it was like they were trying to... catch me.  Guess I look tasty. He goes over to her, puts his arms around her. Come on. It's not so bad down here. They certainly don't have anything like this. I'd have been overhauling the zero- G toilets. But then you realize, there are some things that were never supposed to happen in zero G. It's awful. Just thinking about it, I get afraid... She LAUGHS, reaches for her wine, accidentally knocks the glass which tips over, and rolls right off the Sky Tower. They watch it disappear into the darkness below. Ocops. Here, let me show you... He reaches up PULLS her into the pool. She screams, laughing as she goes in. She surfaces, pulling her soaking shirt over her head and tossing it to the side. .Then what would you say in your report? Victoria looks away, stuck. I can't get to a site fast enough unless I'm already out there. You know that. He turns, disappears through the glass mechanical doors. One, Two, Three. Jack Harper. Lights sparkle across the board. Activation sounds. Jack hits switches. Outside, protective barriers lower. The stratospheric wind VIBRATES the bubbleship. What say we have a little fun today, Bob? The Bobblehead vibrates along with the engines. INTERCUT VICTORIA putting on her headset. Just thinking I'd take Bob manual for the dust-off. Feeling the need. Drone? Already she's got the signal analyzed on six different screens. No matches... Don't be embarrassed, there's always a first time. All right, I'm coming up to the location. Jack begins flying slowly up the twelve hundred foot wall of falling water which almost seems to conceal a Petra behind its veil. Jack reaches the top... JACK'S POV - THE SPIRE AND OBSERVATIONAL DECK of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, now part of a cliff, set in shifted sea-bed, a gushing river pouring past.  New York, New York... It's a wonderful town. The Bronx is up, and the Battery's down... He can hear nothing over the wind and the water. He moves to the balcony edge, looks ""downtown"" at the sunken city. A Venice set in a matrice of rubble and sea-bed. Bob, give me audible on this signal. Almost immediately from the Bubbleship comes the intermittent electronic SQUACK of the signal. It's an old radio system. It's been reactivated. It's the Empire State -- Yeah, I may have seen another drone trap... It's okay -- -- will cook me from the inside before I know it. Don't worry, I'm still more than five clicks from the beacons... IN THE BUBBLESHIP. A BIGGER ALARM goes off, Red skull- and-crossbones flash across the heads-up. Jack DIVES the ship, down over huge rocky outcroppings. Jack, intent on piloting. Static. Some GARBLED SOUNDS. Victoria's voice barely coming through. That's right, Bob. You know where we're going. So, um... Victoria. The ROVER shifts, confused. I was thinking, when our tour is up, maybe we'd stay. We could put in for another -- Wait, wait. Stop yelling. Hear me out. No, don't throw that, that's a... The ROVER turns around. Jack smiles at the poor machine's confusion. The smile dying... this is serious. Maybe you should go, and I should stay... I should stay... His eyes... close. Bob! Let's get going! The Bubbleship is already powering up by the time Jack piles in. He touches a control and the ship shoots up into the air. Vika? Vika, did you get that? An object hit near here. A ship. I saw it through optics in the last minute. I'm not sure it was alien. The Drones'll kill anything that moves. Vika... Negative. I'll report when I get to the site.  What are you looking at? I'm here, and it's definitely one of ours. I'm confirming it. I'm right here. Vika works her displays, scanning, wanting to keep him safe. The wreckage has strewn out thousands of flaming pieces of debris, all which register heat signatures. This thing is ancient, one of the old pre-war shuttles. JACK'S POV - THE WRECKAGE. The ship's guts are strewn across the earth. Several pod-like canisters strewn around, more fixed into the burning wreckage. NO! NO! They're firing on the ship. Vika, it's one of ours. There are people here, and they're killing them! Victoria opens her mouth to respond. She can't. Get out of here! Go away! Get! A moment of insane bravado, Jack un-shoulders his weapon, strafes the Drone with gunfire which knocks it back. It re-centers, weapons chugging with energy. INTERCUT VICTORIA. Staring at the feeds. A screen catching a half-image of Jack firing at the Drone. She's absolutely still, holding her breath... Jack stares at the Drone, at certain death. Well, what the hell are you waiting for? GO ON! And suddenly, the Drone moves on, Canons live, searching on into the wreckage, annihilating other Pods. ON JACK, chest heaving... An instant of BLACK, shuttering back to: CROSS-HAIR POV: We suddenly see Jack through CROSS- HAIRS, tracking him as he shields the Delta Pod with his body, dragging it towards the Bubbleship... It's you... Open it! Victoria obeys, opens the glass doors. WIND fills the living room as Jack hauls the Pod in. Then Victoria touches a control and the walls SEAL. The drones tried to kill her. They destroyed the other survivors. She came off a NASA shuttle. The drones were specifically targeting the pods -- Protocol? Protocol?! Who's the machinery now, Victoria? VICTORIA stares at him. Then retreats from the question into the task at hand. She kneels by the Pod. I know it does. And when we report it, we'll also report that drones slaughtered the other human survivors from one of our ships. See what they make of that. He goes for the equipment. Victoria stares at the woman's face, deeply unsettled... Jack returns with Victoria's bag, and firing up a CUTTER. You're safe. You're in a skytower, on Earth. I know. I know. The glass door slides open behind them. Neither move. It's a Greek funeral vase. Which I want my ashes in, incidentally. Victoria collects the dishes, heads for the kitchen. I just think we need to know why. And what if I can't? They stare at each other, each obscurely frightened. I read these books, of what it was like down here, before... He sits, his legs dangling into the water. She pulls up close, her arms on the side. In this one book I was reading, a man describes being a child. He remembers a yellow kitchen, a baked apple. What was so wonderful about life on the Tet? She looks away... When our time is up next month. I want to put in for one more tour. Victoria pushes off from the side, drifts back... It's almost all gone, Victoria. I want to be here for the end. She turns, resumes swimming laps. Hard, driving through the water. He watches her for a moment, then turns away. I don't know if it is or not, Victoria. I can't remember. She starts to reply... has nothing. Shakes her head. She grabs blankets and pulls them around herself, her back to him, her eyes open, scared. Jack also lies down, staring upwards. And then Jack asks the 64,000 dollar Do you remember her? Victoria doesn't move. Stares straight out. It's beautiful, isn't it? It's your home now. What was your shuttle's mission? She turns to him, watches him carefully in the dim light. And then, lying: Your ship... it's pre-war. No. No, of course not. This answers something important for Julia. .There was a transmission. I don't know who sent it. Funnily enough, you've found your man. How did you know my name? In a few hours, the Tet will come online. Victoria will report your rescue and I imagine they'll send someone down for you. Yes. She gestures out to the Bubbleship on its pad. .You could say that. She SMILES, pleased. A twinkle in her eye... I'll bring her back before Tet- Rise. We just want to try to find the flight recorder. You can't know everything watching from a mile up. She's the flight officer, she wants. to see the wreck of her ship and secure items there. You'd want to do the same thing. Don't worry, we'll be back before you have to make your report. I'll be fine. He turns and boards. Julia is staring at her through the bubble-canopy. The bubbleship rises and then falls off to the side, plummeting towards earth. The Scavs assumed taking out the moon would wipe us out, and it almost did. But we re-grouped, fought back. We beat them in the end. She glances at him. That's if you call nuking half the planet beating anybody. He looks at her, shrugs. They fly past a RESOURCE GATHER, its column of water lifting from the seas. We harvest seawater to supply the Mars colony with the energy we need to live there. We're almost done. Pretty soon, there'll be no more water down here. Yeah. What's left of us are up there now, ready to go where you were headed, Mars. 40 acres and a mule. What we've got left. What you've got. Julia stares out at the Tet. We were born and raised up there. Vika's the A-student. I'm just a tech... I fix things. I... Why are you looking at me like that? Look, it doesn't matter -- We should stay close to... She ignores him, moves on. Deeper in the wreckage, she locates the empty moorings that held the Steel Cylinder Jack saw. It's also gone. What was it? She STARES at him, wanting to say something. Deciding not to. She leans back against a wall of the shuttle. I'm sorry. INTERCUT: Victoria watches as MORE AND MORE Alien figures pass the camera feed. Moving towards Jack and Julia's position. Victoria, HELPLESS. Julia looks up at Jack, directly for the first time. He stares at her... How do I know you... ON JULIA'S FACE. Suddenly her vision racks... JACK SPINS, sees emerging out of the mist, SCAVS. A dozen of them. Alien tribesmen, bristling with weapons, war-like high-tech headdresses. Mandibles and claws. Terrifying and close. Jack reaches for his weapon, bringing it around and -- SLAM! He's hit from the side by a SCAV. Its armored body bringing him to the ground. He tries to CRAWL AWAY, sees Julia grabbed. He twists, sees Scavs crawling over the Bubbleship. Bob! HOME! In the background, the Bubbleship BLASTS OFF, Scavs falling off as Jack KICKS BACKWARDS, breaking the Scavs hold. He rolls away towards his weapon- - straight into the legs of a GIANT SCAV holding an improvised club which now comes down, IMPACTING JACK... Who are you? Where is this? BEECH inhales again. There's a piercing curiosity to Beech's gaze, studying him. We were taken by the Scavs... The Scavs took everything from us. And if you're working with them -- No, they're programmed to Anyone would have... When we get you up to the Tet, there's plenty - Food.Foreveryone. No one does. You go there ---  It took three decades to build the Tet. And when it was finally ready and it was time to go up, there were people who refused. Leaders, who told their people to stay. Staring at Beech, the glint in the man's eyes... And so they stayed. And they were slaughtered. Whatever the conversation is, it doesn't go well. Sykes storms off, angry. Other Scavs go with him. .It'll be fine. Trust me. I'll be home for breakfast. Alone in the Sky Tower, this hits Victoria hard. REWIND. Victoria STARES at the counter, letting it go further back. Then, PLAY. Just STATIC. Then we hear Victoria's end of a conversation we already witnessed: I was born there! No, my father was a -- What? What? No. You're insane. This is insane. He turns to Julia, but she won't help him.  There are people up there - No! It will kill - No. I won't do it. You know I stare into weapons every day, so you can put that away. Because here's what I can tell you...  If the Rover found us, the Drones will too. Unless you want them to find you, let me get somewhere where I can send a signal. Somewhere far from here. Beech... caught. The Drones would kill you. Let me try to stop that.  You're wasting time. On Beech, Sykes... I can fix this. I'll get to the antenna, send a signal with my location. The Tet will call off the search. .You should be safe, for now. Jack starts to go. The Scavs brought it down ten years ago. All. this time, I thought we were at war with the Scavs... but it turns out we were just killing each other. He turns, heads off on foot. After a moment, she follows. I don't think they'll have those on Mars, Honey. Yes. When we get there. ON VICTORIA. Her face totally still. Strangely frozen in the face of this sweet little exchange... That old man is smart. Those fuel cells, the way he's got them tied in with your device... He could blow the whole station. What do you want from me? I'm just a repairman. Look, stop, okay? Just -- I don't know who you're talking STOP! You and that old man have this story... Except I know who I am, okay? I know who I am! Why do I... what is it about this place? When I sleep. You're always there. She kisses him. Vika, it's me. I'm... all right. I'm coming in. Don't report in to Mission, not until I get back. No response. Dead air. Julia is pressed far back in her seat, watching Jack. .I'm 20 minutes out. A TONE makes Victoria look over. The Tet, checking in. Vika... the Scavs. They're humans, like us. The war has become some giant... mistake. She turns. The heartbreak in her face clear.  Vika, she was my wife. She looks at the infinite sky, the clouds, and as the TET appears... He steps towards her and she backs towards the edge. Then come with me.  Don't you see what it means? There are still people, living on Earth. Surviving on earth. People like us. Victoria hears that and laughs, bitter. Vika? Her laughter dies. She looks at him, strangely calm, beautiful in this moment. This is Technician Jack Harper. The signal goes out. Beat. Beat... She's dead. Did you hear what I said? She's dead! I want to talk to somebody. Beat. DAMN YOU! I want to hear your voice! Beat. Beat. Tet Comm Status: ""Communication Ended."" He stares at this last transmission. Then looks up to the big map. From all over the sector, DRONES are closing on the Sky Tower. Closing on him. We have to go. Beech said to look in the radiation zones. I have to go there. I've been wrong about everything else. He dives the ship towards the clouds below. There... He punches the throttle. The Bubbleship with Drone 166 attached blasts in the direction of A CLIFF FACE. DRONE 166 gets free of one restraint, rotates so its cannon come to bear on part of the undercarriage. OPENS UP, blasting the storage to bits... And Jack PULLS UP, just clearing the ridge, Drone 166 IMPACTING ROCK. The Drone blasts clear through, CRASHES You okay? Radiation warning. We're five clicks from the border. Jack makes an adjustment, the Bubbleship SURGES with more speed. It sounds like it's going to tear itself apart. I got this. Jack hits it. They're both propelled back into their seats. The radiation zone coming up fast... They CROSS Bob! BOB! What are you doing Bob!!!!! Bob just bobbles... BLAM! BLAM BLAM!! The blasts from Drone 166 impact them, helpless. Hold on!! Jack grabs a level, a mechanical lever, and HAULS IT UP. THE COCKPIT OF THE SHIP SEPARATES FROM THE BODY. The dead body of the ship tumbles backwards as Drone 166 BLASTS IT, tries to pull up but the Bubbleship IMPACTS Drone 166 which SPINS OUT OF CONTROL towards the ground. THE BUBBLESHIP COCKPIT skims the surface, IMPACTS a ridge, blasting through it. It hits another ridge, the canopy shattering, earth piling in on them as they finally grid to a stop. Jack groans, leans to checks that Julia is okay. She's coughing, dazed, but alive. Son of a bitch, old man... Words die on his lips as he tracks the plume of smoke from the downed Drone 166, lifting over a nearby ridge. He turns back to the ruined ship, grabs his carbine. Stay here. Jack runs towards the smoke which is already being blown clear by a rising sand storm. He flops down in the dirt at the top of the rise, bringing his weapon up. JACK'S POV - DRONE 166. It lies smashed and smoking at the bottom of an incline. Finally dead. The wind and sand are beginning to whistle now, growing intensity... Jack starts to stand... when a FAMILIAR SOUND makes him turn. Hey! Hey, wait! Stop! Don't touch that Drone! His words are eaten up by the wind and sand. He rushes forward. WITH THE REPAIRMAN. We only see his hands as he works on Drone 166. He's very good. Even in the growing sandstorm he clips out a ruined board, slots a new one in. Runs a by-pass around a wire-bundle. The Repairman's fingers go to a familiar switch to activate the Drone... No! Wait! The Repairman hears the voice, even as he flips the switch. He LEAPS BACK, spinning around, his carbine coming off his back, lined on Jack fifteen feet away who Julia! Stay back! Jack 2 senses her movement, SPINS and AIMS his rifle as Jack rushes forward -- No! -- He HITS JACK 2 and they both go down, the weapon FIRING! They fight over the weapon. STOP! You have to understand! You have to understand... Jack 2 throws Jack, leaps on top of him, trying to throttle him, in a full panic. Jack drives up into his gut, rolls away. We're just Drones! We're just Drones, man! You and me! Don't you get it? Don't you know? Jack 2 comes at Jack wildly, emotion over-amping technique. Jack DUCKS the blow, wraps Jack 2 up in a choke-hold. SQUEEZING... It's okay. It's going to be okay... Jack 2 goes limp, unconscious. Jack lets him go, staggers back. Everything finally processing. Then: Julia... He turns towards Julia, sees her kneeling there, holding her side. The blood seeping between her fingers... JACK runs to her as she begins to fall. She is conscious, but just barely. But still, she PULLS BACK from him. I'll be back for you. Okay... Let's go home. The Bubbleship 2 lifts off. .Just a bit of a dust up. I cut myself, I just came by for... No, I'll get it. He kisses her. Gentle, loving... I'll get it. You stay here. And as JACK goes into the sky tower, she returns to happily planting her roses. Oblivious. This is gonna pinch a little. I always thought that plateau up there could be for a house someday. I thought about remaining here, letting the rest of humanity run off to Mars. And we'd just stay here. Jack stops himself, realizing how easily he said ""we."" No. He moves away from her, lights the fire, it starts to crackle. He gets up and goes, walking down to the lake. She stands near the fire, glad for its warmth, watching him out there, silhouetted in front of the lake. WITH JACK. He stares out over the water. Letting the truth wash over him. And then MUSIC from the grotto... the opening bars to the Temptation's ""My Girl."" What was he like? I'm not that man. We can't stay here. She smiles, nods. Stay here... I'm the weapon of this war. BEECH smiles sardonic, nods. Why didn't you tell me? The device...? Julia... Dream about us. Bob, let's prep for outer atmosphere. OUTSIDE, the Bubbleship starts to transform for outer space as it RISES higher and higher... Finally. There you are. I am delivering the survivor from the crash of the NASA ship. ON JACK. The Tet reflected in his eyes. We are... a more effective team. Let's make history. FLASH. The birth of the picture of the two of them, eyes filled with anticipation. The photo in Jack's locker. It's okay Bob, I'm scared too. In front of him, a SLOT opens in the Tet wall. Entering at headway speed. He flies into the Tet, carrying the POD.  You know, you made a mistake, Tet. You left me curious. And right now, I want to see what you're made of... Jack GUNS his ship at the large doors, OPENING UP with canons as he does. In front of him, the door IMPLODES just as Jack's ship reaches it, passing into... Do you like books, Tet!? I like books. Can I tell you something that I read? BEHIND THE BUBBLESHIP. DRONES detach from the walls of the Tet, beginning pursuit. It's a story from Rome, a very great city, that you destroyed. The Bubbleship hauls over, headed deeper into the Tet. There was a guy named Horatius... and he held a bridge, alone. And when they told him to run, to give up, he said -- BOOM! A drone blast EXPLODES A whole engine of the ship. The Bubbleship goes into an uncontrollable SPIN, headed straight at a WALL... He said everybody dies. The thing is, to die well... SMASH! Jack's ship IMPACTS the wall, goes halfway through. The Canopy SHATTERS. Glass and debris tear at him. .What Horatius said, what his argument was, was this... He opens the pod, revealing... -- BEECH'S BODY, and on his chest the raw BOMB. The nuclear warhead from the odyssey surrounded by ten Deuterium fuel cells. No. BEHIND HIM. The Drones blast away the last bit of the Bubbleship, push through... How can a man die... How can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods... The DRONES are on him, weapons lining!"
super_8,JOE ,Joel Courtney," What's this?  You hear Martin barfed in the hall? Who's gonna play the wife, Jen? Oh yeah, that was bad. You talked to Alice Dainard really? -- driving where? -- was she nice? Why is she doing this? I don't understand, we don't even know her-- I don't think that's what it is-- What was she reading? In the silent reading section, what was Alice reading?  I don't understand how the wife makes it a story-- I just can't believe you talked to Alice Dainard. I won't forget. Goodnight, Mrs. Kaznyk-- Oh no thanks, Ma'am, I'm okay.  ""See you tomorrow."" Oh, yessir. Thank you. I thought I was going to have the summer for myself-- I gotta help Charles finish his movie. I won't. Over. Thanks. GUYS-- -- yeah? You can trust me. My dad'll never know. I won't tell him anything.  Want one? Okay. You mind? Close you eyes. Please. Yeah, he's a very relaxed guy. Run! Alice! Guys?! Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is that you? Has anyone seen Alice?! It's my fake blood. It's fake! It wasn't an accident. (turns away, eyes on the FIELD) There was a truck. On the tracks. There. It's a schedule for the train. -- guys, look -- GET IN THE CAR!!!  Are you okay? Guys, keep it down! It's okay-- no one's saying anything. None of us.  Guys -- we're not gonna say anything -- are we?! See? No one's gonna know. -- oh, thanks, Morning, Mr. Kaznyk-- Uh... no. No. ... Looks like a disaster movie, doesn't it...? -- what?  -- you wanna go back?! Yeah, I thought she was good. I think she will. But that was before the new pages, right? Yes, she was, we all were. Yeah, I saw her face. Nothing. I think she's going to do it. Alice-- hi, it's Joe. Lamb. So we have some new scenes. For the movie. We were hoping you'd be in `em. Really? `Cause these are really good scenes. Yeah, I know, I saw it.  Are you okay? You totally did, that's true, I know, but-- I am, which-- under normal conditions I would nev-- We have to-- while the crash is still there. (waits, anxious, then, VERY SOFTLY:) ... please...? Yessir. -- what? OKAY -- You mean why he crashed the train? That whole thing's an Air Force train. I make models-- plastic ones-- you know, glue `em, paint `em-- Air Force trains -- even models -- have these hooks... Every car in that crash had hooks, every one... He had a gun, why not use that? Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make- up Handbook. ... sure. I don't care, they can blow it up. I can show you the train, it's nothing, it's stupid.   JOE You wanna see it? Later? The... train? My train model? The train I made? Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul. Someone with no soul, dead eyes. Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin? -- like her. But hungry, like hungry for human flesh. To make them turn into zombies, because that's what zombies do. Oh my God. That's really good... ... not bad. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy! Lucy! ... Lucy! -- have you... seen Lucy? That's... okay, I'll find a-- So the Air Force is looking for a car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're taking tire prints from the crash site. Over.  And the military's at Woodward's house. Looking for his research. Whatever that means? Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over. Oh gawd, I didn't clean up. Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I watched that one on TV. HERE--- This is the train they wanna destroy. That's dry brush technique.  After you've painted the base color, you take something like...  Euro Gray. There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off. My dad gave it to her the day I was born. She wears it all the time. Used to.  It was bad, how she-- died and stuff, but they got the necklace back. So. We're sitting right here. I thought you were calling Evan. We're not clear. We're not clear. You and I aren't clear about anything. We couldn't be less clear.  Just `cause mom died doesn't mean you know anything about me!!! You don't. You don't know about Alice either -- she's kind! She's NICE to me! Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?  Oh, you wanna come in? Room's still messy. He can be sorta li-- I've known him since Kindergarten, though-- -- no, I totally do, I'm just... sort of in shock at this whole CONVERSATION-- ... yeah... ... it's so weird watching her like this, like she's still here...  ... she used to look at me, this way... like really look. And I just... knew I was there. That I existed. Don't say that.  He's your dad. Why are you not reacting?  That thing went through my wall. What are you so angry about? That I'm not going to let you blow up my train? What's your problem? I know, my dad's being a turkey. We're still gonna finish your movie! What are you talking about? Of course it is. Why? I'll get the camera back, I know where my dad put it -- We can still make the festival. Then what is it about? What's obvious? -- what? Your movie was over! That's what you said! You were upset. I gave you a camera! I helped you! What's your problem? Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie! What do you even care what I think about Alice?! -- wait, you like Alice Dainard?  Guys, look out! We can make another train and blow that one up. I do like her. Sorry about that. ... Charles... Mr. Harkin. What's going on? Hi.  I'm gonna find my dad. Yeah. Mr. Dainard, it's Joe Lamb. I know you don't like me sir, and I'm sorry about that-- but I'm looking for my dad--  ... what? ... I believe you. It took Alice. Guys, WE HAVE TO GO BACK. Back to town -- to find Alice -- we have to find her-- I'm going whether you come or not-- which I really hope you do. We're going to the school to open the trailer Woodward had in the parking lot. I bet that's where he keeps his research. We're gonna learn everything we can about that thing so we can find it. And that's how we're gonna save Alice. Why else are there padlocks on the door?  We're going to the school. Maybe the classroom, but not the dungeon. We shouldn't take River Road, they had a roadblock. Yes. Thank you very much. Do you have a tire iron? GUYS-- Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged from Nellis Air Base in 1963 because of ""subversive conduct,"" whatever that is.  What is this? Cary, we got to find this thing. Woodward wasn't trying to kill it. -- hey, no-- -- guys-- I forced you to come with me... I'm... I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry... ... why--? Charles! Maybe you should wait! -- you guys okay?! Up there, there's broken glass -- Lemme get on your shoulders! No--!!! No, look! We need to get back to town! You want me to drive? I saw something at the cemetery. Woodward said it's subterranean-- I think I know where it-- We gotta go by foot--! Just follow me!  Donny! Hey! Donny, wake up!  We have to get out of here! Come on, guys, let's go. Come on! To the cemetery-- I'm gonna go find Alice-- you have to stay with Martin.  ... yeah. Come on, Cary, we gotta go. Just follow me. Help me! We need to get inside. Cary, help me. Help me, on three. You got any sparklers in there? -- Alice is down there. Shhh. This way. I know. Cary look. We're under the water tower. She's here. We're going to use your firecrackers. There are other tunnels. I need you to make noise. Lots of it, right here, in two minutes. Make it loud and make it last-- gimme some sparklers.  Make sure you're gone by the time it blows: you can't be here, you gotta run. -- Cary, come on, come on-- -- Alice, please -- please --  Alice, wake up! Alice! You're alive! Can you hear me? Are you okay?! I'm just-- doing the best I can to save you. Your dad. He told me. He was worried. And flipping out. -- we need to move-- Alice, help me get the sheriff down. Sheriff, we came that way. Sheriff, I really think we're going the wrong way. I told you to get out! GO! YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE, GO! WE UNDERSTAND! WE KNOW HOW HARD IT'S BEEN! BUT NOT EVERYONE IS HORRIBLE! YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY NOW! -- I know bad things happen-- bad things happen, but you can still live. You can still live, you can still live, you're gonna be okay-- ... he's making a model."
rocky,ROCKY ,Sylvester Stallone," Hey -- ... Just gimme the water. Absolutely. ... I just want the mouthpiece.  I'm a fighter. ...Look who's home. Real good. Yeah, here an' there. Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now! Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb. Goin' fishin'? What's ya name again? Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.  A hundred an' thirty. That's it? -- Completely? What about for food an' stuff? ... The juice is climbin' every week. Ya still light seventy. ...That's what coulda happened. ... How's the turtle food this week? Me, I'm kinda aggravated. Ain't your fault - Here's the problem. The last food I got here had more moths than flies -- An' the moths get caught in my turtle's throat -- That makes them cough --  Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin' about the turtle food -- Like I was sayin', the moths get caught in the turtle's throat an' makes 'em cough...  A little cough an' I gotta smack 'em on the shell -- An' whatta think they get?  I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What? Shell-shocked! Inventin' jokes ain't easy.  How's Butkus this mornin'? Yo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead. ...What kinda dog is this again? The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago. He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo. ... Fine. Of wa? I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin no more. The third -- Shoulda seen it. How come?  ... These ain't my clothes.  ... These ain't my pictures. Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here? Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more? You were ready to bite that guy's face. Creed's great. Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey? I said, how ya feelin'?  Yeah. I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker? ... Tomato? ...What? Come July, twenty-five. Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker. Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years. Yeah -- Yeah, Kayo. Spider Rice. You think everybody I fight is a bum. Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it. ...No. Yeah, sure.  ...I think I'm gonna take a steam -- Shoulda seen me fight -- Did good, y'know. ... Wow -- cold!  Good night to catch pneumonia.  Ah -- I came in here for somethin'... Oh, yeah, would ya like somebody to walk ya home?  Hey, how's my buddy doin'? (looks into Butkus' cage) -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later. Catch pneumonia out there -- Seen Paulie? Yo, Paulie. Yo, Paulie. Your sister's givin' me the shoulder. Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes.  Nothin'.  She looks at me. Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister? Hey -- Don't get mental, man. Ya always in a bad mood -- I'm thirty myself. I don't see no crowd around you, neither. Let's get outta this stink. ... Sure. Absolutely... Clown. He took his best shot an' became champ -- What shot did you ever take? ... No wine -- Bad for ya' brain. No wine. Why? No dollar.  ... That's an old one. Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya brother know you're hangin' out so late?  What'd you say? Did these guys teach you to talk dirty?  Huh? What?  Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum. Don't ya never come round this girl -- Go home. Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face! How come ya wanna hang out with those guys?  They teach ya bad things. Hey!  When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood. Make your teeth yella -- Makes your breath like garbage. Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'. 'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty.  They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious.  Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore.  You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore. That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it. Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.  ... That's your house, ain't it?  Listen, I hope ya don't -- What was I gonna say? Ya, somethin' like that. 'Night, Marie.  ... Yeah, who're you to give advice, Creepo. Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder.  An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay? Ya sure? How'd you know? Paulie's sister.  She ain't retarded, she's shy. Does that bum have to say that? He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's.  Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work -- Don't like yours neither. Move your shoulders down. Yeah. Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.  I usta be deadly at half-ball. What kinda business? Maybe ya should see a doctor. Maybe another job is the best thing. Gazzo's gotta come to you. Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now. Ya sister knows I'm comin'? Maybe ya better forget it. ... Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's kinda hard for me to think of somethin' to say, y'know -- 'Cause I never talked to a door before, I mean whatta ya say to a door.  ... Maybe I better forget it. Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't too happy at this moment, but would ya do me a favor -- I ain't got nobody to spend Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout you an' me goin' out -- Get somethin' to eat, maybe laugh a little, who knows... Would ya like, I dunno, go out together?  We'll have a good time.  What's ya sister like to do? I didn't want no turkey anyway. To you, to me it's Thursday. Looks quiet, y'know. I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --  Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody. Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out. Listen, I gotta problem.  This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing -- Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise -- ... Ten minutes. ... Yeah, give 'er the Blades. Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles.  Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more.  All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro. Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight.  Kinda do it like a hobby.  See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right? Absolutely. I just dislocated my finger. It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think? How 'bout some Cokes? This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.  See, I ain't graceful, y'know -- I don't move good -- Stink as a dancer too -- But I can really swat, I hit hard,        real hard, but I'm a southpaw an' nobody wants to fight a southpaw! -- Havin' a good time?  Y'know how I got started in the fight racket? Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.  What's funny? I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.' Charge it.  Had ya goin', didn't I, huh? Some people are very shy by nature. I would say you're very shy bu nature. Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me. Then why did I bother bringin' it up?  'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy. Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum. ... I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket.  The roughest part is the mornin' after. After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare. ... Guess. Would ya like a glass of water? Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.  ... Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off. I had it pulled.  People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call? D'you really wanna call? You sure? Why? I'll call your brother.  !!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's with me!  I'll call ya later.  What's the matter?  Ya don't like the room? It's only temporary. What's the problem?  You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it? It's okay. It's all right -- You're my guest.  They're all the same. Yo, I'm not comfortable either. But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.  Would ya take off your glasses? The glasses... Please. Do me another favor? Could ya take off that hat.  I always knew you was pretty. I wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't have to kiss me back if ya don't feel like it. 'Bout what? Message -- What message? Ya puttin' me on? When was they here? Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners. Balboa, Rocky Balboa. ... Thanks.  Rocky. No -- Just me. Sparrin'? I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available. Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what? I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner. ... Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate. Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ.  He's just there to help condition the man. ... Ah... Absolutely. Feel?  I dunno... Happy.  Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can. I thought of it 'bout eight years ago, when I was eatin' dinner. Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago. Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian! Sure I did.  You heard. Why? It don't matter. It don't bother me none. Help what? I'll do okay. Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself. See ya tomorrow.  How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV? Ya puttin' me on, right? 'Bout seven. Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me? It did. Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more. I feel bad about walkin'. A few bucks. Do I have to pay juice? Gonna try. No action. I'm gonna do somethin with it. Black market? Yo, you gonna show, Tony? Look who's home! Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here?  Here, sit down.  Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much. I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint. Yeah. Freak luck for sure.  Freak luck is a strange thing. Turtles -- domestic turtles.  Fifty years, huh. How 'bout a glass of water?  ... What?  Ya got a good mind for dates. Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture. Really think so? Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker. ... Ya gave Dipper my locker. The fight's set -- I don't need a manager. I got pain an' experience too.  Whatever I got, I always got on the slide.  This shot's no different.  I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none. I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.  ... Tight. ... No. Gazzo's a good man. Keep this job, ya eat better. Whatta you think? What? Sure I like her. I dunno -- she fills gaps.  She got gaps.  I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.  Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister. That's why I can't put ya together with Gazzo, cause ya talk too much -- big mouth. Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister. I never had good footwork. ... Sure.  Should I do this? ... People talk to me more.  Apollo's a great fighter. Maybe --  I'll tear his head off. Derogatory?  Yeah, he's great.  Yo', Dipper, why're ya -- They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag? Sharp -- Real nice. No... Sharp -- You look great. Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak. Can't fool around -- You look very great. Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know. Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know. Whatta these guys want? Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private. Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me in one day an' I hit the beef here an' liked it -- An' since I become a challenger, the owner don't mind neither. I think me and Paulie invented it. Yeah... Threw my whole day off. Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it. ... What's to say?  I dunno what he wants from me -- ... It's cold outside, Paulie.  Hey -- What can I do about it? What break?  Huh?  What break! Who am I to give breaks!  I'm a fighter, you haul meat.  You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!  ... An' what ya said to my girlfriend ain't right -- Do it again, I'll kill ya.  Wanna hear a dirty joke? Yo, Benny. ... I'll try.  Any time.  ... Run for mayor. Yeah...  My first call... Hello?  Yeah, speakin' -- Who is this? Bruce?  Bruce who? -- Yo, Bruce!  How ya been?  I ain't seen ya for nine or eight years -- Yeah, things is great, how's things with you upstate -- Ya sellin' real estate, hey, that's a good job... Yeah, I gotta advance, but I bought ringside seats for the guys at the gym.  I get the hundred an' fifty grand after the fight...  ... Yeah, I know it's a lotta money -- Condominiums?  Nobody uses them anybody.  Listen, I think a pet shop is a good investment, y'know -- I don't care 'bout long hours -- there's no depreciation -- that don't matter none to me -- Yeah, I like animals. Why don't ya give me ya number an' I'll call ya back?  Lemme getta pencil --  Okay, what is it -- four- twelve 659-2424.  Yeah, yeah, thanks for callin' -- Sure I'll get back to ya, Bruce -- see ya.  ... What? I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more. I gotta go out for a while.  ... Come. ... Can't do it. ... I can't beat him. Yeah, I can't beat him. I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere. ... I dunno. It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before -- C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed.  If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...  ... No foolin' around. Yo, Mick, can I have my rob? ... I'm doin' it for a friend. I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand. Whatta ya think that outfit cost?  Christ, Jack Dempsey. They must be friends. Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try. How am I doin'? See how fast he is -- damn! Damn!  How's it look? ... The guy's great. Fine... That guy's great.  See what? He ain't losin' nothin'. Would you keep goin'? Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes! How I look out there, Mick? Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna make it -- I'm gonna make it!  I'll kill ya all... Don't stop nothin' -- Gimme ya best!!!!  Gimme ya best!!! ... Don't want one. Yo, can I have my locker back?"

What's a good word -- a solid word for ""need"" -- Nah, sounds too ""needy."" Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear. Out? Out out? You're going alone? Him!! Why him? Why not me?  Not hungry. It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --  Not from you.  Good night. What are you two talking about. What's so fascinating?? So important?? No cream and sugar, moron. She takes it black. Toldya. Hi... Shh. I'm... on a mission. Don't tell anyone, huh? That's it: she's laughing. I'm done. Come on! Look at him, those shifty eyes, that -- phony grin...!!  You gonna eat that? Oh, the yawning trick. That's so 1950's! Watch his arm -- It's not that easy, okay?  Plus, you're nine. You're not old enough to give me advice. Something's wrong -- Father -- I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. I wasn't here. You died alone -- Hi. I am.  But -- I have something to say, too.  I never had the guts before - But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there -- Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this -- (points at his own face) But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever. Good. ""One falls, two shall arise."" So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.  Those things never work. Never.  I won't take 'em. They never work. Boy Scout. Sparky?? Who came up with that? Myers?  This better be the place or I'll puke. Sebastian Plackba #16... Let me ask for directions.  Animam edere, animus corpus... Sixty feet further, comrades, and three rows in... This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say ""hi"" Ivan. We'll be alright... as long as we don't separate --  Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything... ...Polo. On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one. Don't move. We -- No. Don't -- Son of a --  Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach -- Screw that. You killed my father -- Give your soul to God, Your ass is mine.  Oh, no you don't -- You like playing possum, you Nazi pinhead?  Then try playing dead. Are you okay? You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you. Yup.  My job. Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!! Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two alone.  Liz... No. Noooo! Noooo!!! For her.  Anung-un-Rama... I can live with that. Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there. How big can it be? They never work -- Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt -- Ouch -- It did hurt. ""You, on the other side: let her go. Because for her, for her -- I'll die. I'll cross over.""  ""And you'll be sorry I did."""
swordfish,GABRIEL ,John Travolta," Take Dog Day Afternoon for example. Arguably Pacino's greatest performance, excepting The Godfather, Part I, and Scarface, of course. A masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet's best. The acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch. But, they didn't push the envelope. What if in Dog Day, Sonny really wanted to get away with it? What if, and here's where it gets tricky. What if they'd started killing hostages? No mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam, splatter. What? Still no bus? How many innocent victims would they let get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on hostage situations? And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no C.N.B.C., no M.T.V. No Internet. Fast forward to the present, same situation. Can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media? In hours it would be the top story from Boston to Budapest. All caught in 150 millimeter zoom, computer enhanced, and color corrected. You would practically taste the brain matter. Six hostages die. Ten. Twelve. Twenty. Thirty. Relentless. One after another. All over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured. Just a thought. I mean it's not really within the realm of conventional cinema, but what if...? Really?   How come? Pacino escapes. With the money. Boyfriend gets the sex change operation. They live happily ever after. No? Homophobia? Oh, well. Life does tend to be stranger than fiction.  Well, guys, gotta jet. This place is kinda dead. Thanks for the coffee. Rene Descartes is sitting in some bar in Paris. Bartender says, 'Hey, you want another drink?' Descartes says, 'I think not.' And disappears. Move. I won't ask again. Thank you. Stanley... you coming? How we doin'? Good.   Take her out. Don't talk, listen... When I made my Dog Day Afternoon analogy, I was not speaking metaphorically. We have 22 hostages. Each has been wrapped with 20 pounds of C-four explosives. On top of that we have taped 15 pounds of stainless steel ball bearings -- -- making them the world's largest walking Claymore mines. Around her neck is a radio- frequency electronic dog collar -- Dog walks out of his yard, he gets the shit shocked out of him. Same thing -- -- their yard is this bank.      So, don't fuck with me.  Big Stan. Nice suit. You know, they say it's the clothes that make the man... Hope not.  Buy you a drink? Actually you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand. But that's not the point. I heard this story about this young hacker who made a virus that broke the F.B.I.'s Carnivore program that was actively reading every subscriber's E-mail and scrambled the systems. He did what the federal judges wouldn't do and kept the government out of our Privacy. Stanley, meet Helga. Stanley, we have a problem, maybe you can help us out. Take a look at this. No need for modesty, we're all friends here, Stanley. You want something from me, amigo, I want something from you. D.O.D. dBase, 128 bit R.S.A. encryption. Whattaya think? Impossible? So it can be done? Maybe slide in a Trojan horse hiding a worm? Sort of. Marco, let's give him some incentive. Relax, Stanley. I've been told the best crackers in the world could do this in sixty minutes. Unfortunately, I need someone who can do it in sixty seconds. 'Fraid not. Forty-five seconds. Time is a wasting, big guy. You have thirty seconds, Stanley. She's very good, isn't she, Stanley? C'mon, Stanley. 20 seconds. Fifteen. Ten... Nine... Three... Two... Too bad, Stanley. Ya gotta die. I was just fucking with you, Stan. Big Stan.   I was afraid we lost you. Let's go up to the house. I'm having a little get-together. I'll explain it to you there.  So Stan, tell me. How'd you do it? Break the code. At the club. You broke the entire encryption, a silencer against your eye and your cock in someone's mouth, all in less than sixty seconds. How? C'mon, you can do better than that. How'd you do it? C'mon, Stanley. How'd-you-do-it?  You definitely have a gift, Stan. The most powerful people on the planet are like you. With a laptop and a phone line you can make God look like a thirteen-year-old with a stack of Playboys and a lack of imagination.  C'mere, Stan, let me show you something. Pretty impressive, huh.  So... Here's the deal. I need a worm, Stanley. A hydra, actually. A multi-headed worm to break an encryption and then sniff out latent digital footprints throughout an encrypted network. Vernam encryption. Actually, we're talking 512 bit. Tell ya what, I'll pay you ten million dollars. That should be enough to get your daughter back...  ... unless of course it's impossible. Ginger...? Well, Ging, doesn't this look friendly. Get? You look like shit. Ginger kick your ass? Yes he is. I see you have a groupie. Have you heard of Operation Swordfish? You'll appreciate the irony here -- -- In the early Eighties the D.E.A. set up a network of dummy corporations as a government front to launder drug money and gather evidence. Problem is, the front companies started making money. Lots of money. By 1986, when Operation Swordfish was terminated, there was close to 400 million dollars in the D.E.A.'s accounts. It didn't disappear. It just sat in those accounts earning interest, it's been 15 years. You have any concept how much money we'd be actually talking about today? Billions, brother. That's nine zeros.  Look, this is a sweet deal. We go in over phone lines. Pop the firewall, drop in the hydra, and just sit back and wait for the money. No problem.  Look behind you, Stan. I'm not exactly following you.  Senator, I sincerely hope you did not contact me and jeopardize the safety of me and my men for this. Sir, with all due respect. Do you think there is any aspect of this operation I am not fully aware of? What? A vacation?   Have I ever failed you, sir? It's my point. Senator, this operation is going forward. Everything is under control. Stan? What's wrong, Stanley, you look like you've seen a ghost? C'mon, Stanley. Let's talk. Let's go. 'Cause I don't want to talk to you in the house, Stanley. Let's go. How you doing, Stanley? Something you need to say to me?  You know anything about Harry Houdini? He used to make an elephant disappear in a theater full of people. You know how he did it? Misdirection. We have a tail.  Hope you had a light lunch, Stan. Hold the wheel. Keep it straight. It's just rough when you grow up lovin' James Bond movies. Don't worry, Stanley, it'll be over soon. Drive, drive! Go, go!  Keep your cool, Stanley. Goddamit.   I knew it. Get in the fucking car, Stanley. You're on my good side and you want to stay there. Stanley, I like you, but don't confuse kindness with weakness. So, get in the fuckin' car. I need my hydra.  Ahh, the great American outdoors. I'll never understand the appeal of fly-fishing, Jim. A little too much like masturbation for me, without the payoff. This's a catch-and-release stream, isn't it? Oh c'mon, Jim. You gotta see the irony in the chairman of the Joint Sub-Committee on Crime, fishing in a catch-and-release stream. How could you do it, Jim? After all we have sacrificed. All the blood, all the death... I've changed my identity so many times, I don't even know what I look like anymore. How could you turn on me when we are so close? You brought me in to get the job done and you didn't want to know about the consequences. I told you there was nothing that I was unaware of -- You have misplaced your loyalties, Senator. You have sold America out. I am a patriot, and patriotism does not have a four-year shelf life. Unfortunately, politicians do. Thomas Jefferson once shot a man on the White House lawn for treason, Senator. You tried to execute me in the name of politics, now I execute you in the name of the people.  Make sure that bus doesn't top out over fifteen-seven. Stan, how are you? Have you finished? Here. Just like I promised, Stanley. Soon, Stanley.     Walk with me. I'm about to do something against my better judgement. I'm going to tell you something I never tell anyone. I'm going to tell you who I am. Do you?    You think I'm a bank robber.    Really, I'm just like you. That I am. And worse. Much worse. I am forced to operate on a different plane than you. But, I have ethics. Rules to which I must adhere. 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to Madison because he was concerned that the freedoms of the constitution would be ignored. Listen to me and you will. In the 1950s, armed with this letter, J. Edgar Hoover created an organization to protect the freedoms of this country at all costs. I'm talking about your daughter. Yes. You, your daughter and 200 million other Americans who take their freedoms for granted. You don't understand what it takes to protect those freedoms. That's my job, Stanley, to protect your way of life at all costs. That's right, Stanley -- -- 'cause wars cost money. That's what I'm telling you, Stanley. We are at war. Anyone who infringes on America's freedom. Terrorists' states, Stanley. Someone must take their war to them. They bomb a church, we bomb ten. They hijack a plane, we take out an airport. They execute American tourists, we tactically nuke an entire city. We must make terrorism so horrific that it becomes unthinkable to attack Americans. Maybe. I wanted you to do this because you wanted to, because we need men like you, but our time table's been moved up. Just relax and it will all be over in twenty-four hours. You're rich, Stanley. Pretty soon Holly and you will be basking in the sun on the deck of some eighty-foot scarab, eating bon bons and living the good life.  Pretty slick. No. He'll be back. We gotta move. Load up. Get that son-of-a-bitch on the phone. If you need to test my resolve then God help you. You have 25 minutes. That plane better be on the runway. Get my money, Stanley. Do you really think I wanted it to come to this. Do you? I am not a psychopath, Stanley, but I told you, I will sacrifice as many lives as it takes to protect our country, including my own.  Now get me my money. Both of you. You have my word, Stanley. C'mon. We okay? They just cut the power. Forget it. How long to transfer the money? National Bank of Zurich. Spread it evenly over these accounts. It won't be there that long. Good job, Stanley, I got someone who wants to see you. Hold up.  Told you I was a man of my word, Stanley. What? What do you mean, gone? Get her! I'm thinking. Tell ya what.    No deal. Marco!   Grab Agent Sculley! In all reality, Stan, she has you to thank for this. That first night in Prague you broke the D.O.D. database that contained her true identity. She's D.E.A., Stan, but without you, I never would have known. String up the D.E.A. bitch. Then get me my money, Stan. Okay.  Take a moment, big guy. Don't make me put you in a wheelchair. I didn't Stan, you did.    But we're not done yet.  Marco... There are a lot of hostages here. I cared about Ginger, can you imagine what I could do to someone I don't care about. How long before the money jumps? They better hope you installed a back door or it could be a long day. Somebody get me a laptop.  Okay, Stan. Sixty seconds. Forty-five seconds, Stanley. Twenty seconds, Stan. Fifteen.   She's gonna die, Stanley. Ten. Nine... Eight... Seven. Four, three, two... One. Well, that was fun. Well, 'bout time for us to leave. Au contraire. Do you hear that?  That's the sound of America watching.  Let's roll. I don't think any of us want a repeat of this morning. Keep at least a hundred yards from this bus at all times and I want the airspace for five miles clear.  Ladies and gentlemen, we will be in your lives for approximately 55 more minutes. This bus has just become your new yard. So sit back, think happy thoughts, and this will be over before you can say 'cat in the hat.' Whaddaya think, Stanley? Really? Five hundred bucks says I do. Tell ya what, Stanley, I'll even spot you the five bills. Stan, c'mere. Take a look. You're not looking at the big picture. Stanley, here's a scenario. You have the power to cure all of the world's diseases. But the price for this is that you must kill a single, innocent child. Could you kill that child to save the world? You disappoint me, Stanley.   It's the greatest good. Now you're getting it.   How about a hundred? How about a thousand? Not to save the world, but just to preserve our way of life. You're wrong, Stanley. Some men are put here to shape destiny, to protect freedom, despite the atrocities they must commit. I am one of those men. Thousands die every day for no reason at all, where is your bleeding heart for them? You give your twenty dollars to Greenpeace every year and think you are changing the world. What countries will harbor terrorists, when they realize the consequences of what I will do? Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for forty million each? I buy half a dozen, I even get a discount. I saw Sugarland Express, Stan. Didn't like the way it ended. Misdirection, Stanley. Listen... Gentlemen... Hold on.  The only way to fly, huh, Stanley. Bank right! We okay? Well, Stanley, gotta fly. Take care of that little girl. Maybe I'll see you again one day. C'mon, Stan. Everything doesn't always end the way you think it will.  'Sides, audiences love happy endings. Houdini made an elephant disappear in a room full of people. You know how he did it? Elephant suit.     Filled with his assistants. Assistants jump out. Blend in with the others. Voila. No more elephant. -- so advanced nowadays you could probably pilot it from your trailer.  Misdirection..."
silverado,PADEN ,Kevin Kline," Pleased to meet you. You got no idea what they were after? Offend anybody lately? Jefferson City? I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?  Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay. Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck. Where's the pinto going? Where's Turley? Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath. Is this loaded? I'm good for it. Excuse me, there -- I'll take this one. How much to borrow it?  What can I get for that?  What's it take? I'll be back. Can't you see this horse loves me? I'll tell you what, on the underside of this saddle I got my name scratched. Take a look and you'll see.  Hello, Cobb. It's been a while. Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it. I've given that up.  You've got a legitimate job. You're right. Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.  Thirteen... bad luck. And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about. (he messes with his hat, disgruntled) 'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it. (frowns at his new hat) I surely do miss that hat. Going to Turley, was it? What's Turley like? They got a saloon there? Women? Maybe... I'll ride along... as far as Turley. No, I'm not Hawley.  Doesn't look quite fair. We'd rather stay. You're kidding.  So this is the guy you're going to hang?  I was afraid of that. Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort. I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck. You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more. It's not going to be easy. Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry. C'mon, I'll buy you a drink. All right, you buy me a drink. You know, a good smelly saloon is my favorite place in the world. You're wearing my hat. What else you got that's mine? I hope your hand isn't tickling my bone-handled Colt. If you stand up real slow and let me see, you might live through this night. You're making a big mistake. I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere. I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses. The other guy drew first.  Your brother seems pretty good, but it isn't going to be easy getting in here.  We didn't get that far.  Hey! What are you doing, you crazy kid? Don't do it! Oh, Jesus! Somebody stop him! Cut him down! For God's sake, cut him down! Hurry up! You might be able to save him! I think I'm going to be sick... when I see what Langston does to you when he gets here. Got to be real quiet here.  What now? Where's your brother? Oh-oh. He is now. Oh, a guy who got run out of town... Deal me in.  I think you got a point, Emmett. Maybe I better stay here with her.  You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.  Oh, I was just checking the, ah... (gestures vaguely over his shoulder) ...you know, lookin' in. He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us. Never will again. Good luck, Mal. I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking. (catches Emmett's amused look) I'll see you around.  And a pretty lady. Believe it. Why? What's that? Hannah, don't tell me what you think I want to hear. You work here? Bourbon. Nifty. I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss -- Paden. Stella... Are you the midnight star herself? My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon. And I know what I'm talking about. It's the only place I'm happy. You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling? So-called? Why'd you go into business with him? Who's the owner? I just got to town. Luck, I guess. You didn't tell me you owned a saloon. Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living. All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up. Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb. I see you're an understanding boss. Maybe we ought to ask Stella. Is this a fair mix? I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey. What's this? Oh, yeah? How good?  Here's to the good stuff. What's the problem here? Get out of here, Jake. That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended. I don't want you getting anyone in my place. Why not now? Give me some of the good stuff. It evened out in the end. They locked me up, but the dog sprung me. He left me. This is a lot of money. It is that. This is her life. I'll go before she does. Well, thanks, but forget it. What is it you want from me? I'm a great believer in doing nothing. Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you. Why are they doing this, Mal? I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?  Lucky. Where's Emmett now?  It looks bad, Rae. He's a hard man, and he won't give them what they want. It's gonna cost him. I don't think so.  Where is he now? Yeah, maybe I will too. We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb. I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight. Cobb, you've got nothing I need. What's she got to do with it? What do you mean? What makes you say that? You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.  Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time. To my midnight star. I like your attitude. But it can be risky. I don't want you to get hurt. Where'd he go? You better get in there with her until this thing is over.  Let's get out of here.  Last one to the Midnight Star buys. Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb. I've got a job."

What is it? Whatta you mean she's not here? She just died, your mother just died? When? Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How? Johnny, I gotta know. Murdered?  Why? What kinda twisted animal. Whatta you mean... What are you talking about? I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away. I'll warn them. What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is. So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me? I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different. What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again? What do I gotta do? Why not just get the cops to watch the bar? What do I tell them? I was, uh, I'm not really...  A married fireman. Frank. I don't think so. I follow fires, nothing else. Yeah, it was a close call, but... Close is just close if you're still alive to talk about it, y'know/ There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about. I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he... I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio. No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future. I'm serious.  I'll be damned. No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em. Whatta we do now? Got it. How? All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing. Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future. What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon? What are we like in...1998?  Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off? Yeah, you betcha. Wow. Hang on a sec, John. Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about. Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy... John, say hello to my wife...Julia. John, you still there? You all right? Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what. Just fine.  You? I'm trying to quite.  Turns out those things'll kill you. Yep.  That's what I do.  Mary Finelli... OPEN UP, OPEN THE DOOR...ah...ummm...THIS IS THE POLICE. It's okay, Ma'am.  I'm the police. He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it. Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse. This is wrong...it's like we cheated... I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy. Johnny, I know, but... John, he's got my driver's license. He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live. No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license. In my pocket. What? How the hell am I gonna do that? What... Okay, okay... I got it. Huh?  I gotcha, I gotcha Chief! Hang on.  Okay. You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one? Okay, I'm on it.  Hey. What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?  John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if... Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.  Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away. What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there? No, I don't. About what? Okay.  It's okay, Bud.  I'll be right back.  Stay there, John. What do you mean? No.  This isn't what you think. Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio. Trust me, Bud.  Do that for me. John, you there? Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John... ...you gotta help me, Chief. Carl Shepard.  Detective out of the 15th precinct. I swear, Satch. As nuts as that sounds, yes. Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone? He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on... What if I could prove it to you, Satch? What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball. The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park. In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch. She's in harm's way.  He's gonna be coming for her. Promise me, as a friend.  October 22, don't let her out of your sight.  You twisted animal... You try putting that thing around my neck and I'll rip your throat out.  You want me dead, use the gun. You got to help me.  He's trying to kill me.  Elvis has left the building. Detective Deleon. Satch, you gotta listen to me... No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me. Next time lets put some money on it. Hey, bud.  John, John?  You there?  Johnny? We did it, John.  We stopped him. What's wrong?  This is between you and me. Get your fucking hands off my wife. I'm still here, Chief. Bring me home, son!  Bring me home!"
braveheart,WALLACE ,Mel Gibson," Go home. Some of us are in this, I can't help that now. But you can help yourselves. Go home. On your way somewhere, M'lord? My name is William Wallace. I am no bandit who hides his face... Find this man a horse. Give him a horse. Not this horse. That one. Today we will spare you, and every man who has yielded. Go back to England. Tell them Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more. Tell them Scotland is free. Hamish, I... thank... Thinking. What do we do when Longshanks sends his whole northern army against us? They have heavy cavalry. Armored horses, that shake the very ground. They'll ride right over us. We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long. Stand up, man, I'm not the Pope. Thank her for me. That's my friend, Irishman. And the answer's yes. You fight for me, you kill the English. Stop here and rest. Marion! Is... is it you? I'm dreaming. I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you. I need you so much! I love you! He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide them and run! Split again! No matter how we go, they follow. They have our scent. My scent. They've tricked us. The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them. Exactly. No English lord would trust an Irishman! Do the nobles rally? For presenting yourselves on this battlefield, I give you thanks. I give homage to Scotland. And if this is your army, why does it go? Sons of Scotland!... I am William Wallace! Yes, I have heard! He kills men by the hundreds! And if he were here, he would consume the English with fireballs from his eyes, and bolts of lightning from his ass! I am William Wallace. And my enemies do not go away. I saw our good nobles hanged. My wife... I am William Wallace. And I see a whole army of my countrymen, here in defiance of tyranny. You have come to fight as free men. And free men you are! What will you do with freedom? Will you fight? Yes. Fight and you may die. Run and you will live, at least awhile. And dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that, for one chance to come back here as young men, and tell our enemies that they make take our lives, but they will never take our freedom? No! They will not! And I will. Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field. I have an offer for you. From his king? Absolutely. Here are Scotland's terms. Lower your flags and march straight to England, stopping at every Scottish home you pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft, rape, and murder. Do that, and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you will die today. I'm not finished. Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that bridge, stand before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass. Be ready, and do exactly as I say. Steady! Hold... hold... NOW! FORM! Here I am, English coward! Come get me!! Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be sure the English see him ride away! For Scotland! You are Robert the Bruce. My father fought in support of yours. I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground. LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands this! This! There is a difference between us. You think the people of this country exist to provide you with position. I think your position exists to provide the people with freedom. And I go to make sure they have it. And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less? We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why. Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I. Back! Wait for it to burn! STOP! NOT YET! LISTEN TO ME!  They wish to frighten us! Or goad us into attacking too soon! Don't look away! LOOK! Behold the enemy we fight! We will be more merciful than they have been. We will spare women, children, and priests. For all else, no mercy. Longshanks! I have come. Wife of Edward, the king's son? It's battle I want, not talk. I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are. York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls. Longshanks did far worse, the last time he took a Scottish city.  I am no bandit. And I do not lie. Or in French if you prefer that: Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to his face, and see if his eyes can convince you of the truth. A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas. SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS! She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant. I've never told anyone. I don't know why I tell you -- except because you look... much like her. And someday you will be a queen, and you must open your eyes!  Tell your king that William Wallace will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot, while I live. A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face. Peace?! With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen! We won at Stirling and still you quibbled! We won at York and you would not support us! Then I said nothing! Now I say you are cowards! War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you. Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it. And I will consult with mine. Remember when the English turned their hounds on us? Maybe we should introduce them to our dogs. Mornay has come. So will the Bruce. Stephen ready? Irish troops! It's only a faint to shield the crossbows! Now! Give 'em the dogs! Now! Charge! Charge them! Hamish! Ham -- Get him away! A charge! Form up! Form up! You... were like my father... Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves. A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it. Why did you? You have... you have a husband. I cannot love you for the sake of revenge. I rest. Aye. But it won't let me dream. You've all sworn to Longshanks. So let the council swear publicly. I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland. Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way. Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too. We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom! My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it. No. One of us is enough. Treason. Against whom? Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king -- -- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject! I do not confess. I am so afraid... Give me strength. M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger. Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves? If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already. Your people are lucky to have a princess so kind that she can grieve at the death of a stranger. Every man dies. Not every man really lives. It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me. That... will... clear your sinuses. FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM! In the year of our Lord 1314, patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the fields of Bannockburn. They fought like warrior poets. They fought like Scotsmen. And won their freedom. Forever."
go,RONNA ,Sarah Polley," Paper or plastic? Paper or plastic? Paper or plastic? They're at the bottom. In red. Where it says, double coupons. Look how far it got you. No. Answer's still no. One of the three.  Okay, Simon. In case you haven't heard the buzz, the scoop, the word on the street, I'm getting evicted. Tomorrow. So pardon me if I'm not in a holly-jolly mood right now.

I know I thought of one before. I am. What? That wasn't it. I never heard of fucking ""Xerxes."" He went to Vegas for the weekend. Scurvy? Doughnuts, aisle four. How much? You're overpaying. Mary Xmas Supafest. Gimme a number. Let me see what I can do. So do you want the o.j. or not? I don't need Simon. I'm going to Todd. Ok, listen up. If Simon were here -- which he's not -- he would charge fifteen, when I know he gets it for ten. Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just once. When Simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy. But this is my deal, so just sit back and watch. Besides, Todd likes me. This won't be any problem. Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me through Simon. Can I come up? Todd? I didn't wake you up, did I? I keep him honest. I need a favor. Twenty hits of ecstacy. Todd, I would never fuck you like that. There's this big Christmas party thing. Warehouse, you know. A bunch of us are doing sort of a pre-party thing. No. Swear to God. Understood. Fifteen? I was thinking more like ten. It's just that I know you charge Simon ten. Here's the deal. There's 20 of us. I need all of this. But I only have two hundred. I mean, that's all I have. No, hear me out. This two-hundred is like a downpayment. You give me the stuff, I get the extra hundred from them, then I come right back and pay you. I could leave something with you. Collateral. Claire, could you come up with me for a sec? Forty-five minutes. Hour, tops. You just have to sit there. Jesus, Claire. Don't get 818 on me here. How much shit have I done for you? This is nothing. Claire. That bracelet of mine you're wearing is an accessory. You are just some chick who's sitting in an apartment. That's it. Okay, no bullshit. I need this. I don't get this money, I get evicted. My ass is out the street.  No, Claire. I don't have anyone else to go to. I am coming to you and I am asking for your help. Please. Help me. We'll be back by eight, I promise. Is this it? Are you sure? I'm a top-seeded amateur. Ronna. That was just a friend. Some of that orange juice would be great.  You got a bathroom? You're fine. You're fine. Fine. All yours.  No. No, see we don't. That's what I came here to tell you. I couldn't get anything. It's true. Who the fuck are you? Monty Hall? Did you know I'm only 17? I probably shouldn't be drinking this beer, should I? Being so underage and all. I think it was Simon they were after. He deals all the time out of the store. I mean, he makes change out of the fucking register. They were fishing. I bit. It's Claire. She paged me while I was in there. We can't. They're gone. I flushed them. Think of something. I need a hundred bucks or 20 hits of X. What?! You took one, didn't you? Fuck you, Mannie! How could you do this to me? I need you now. Drive. Just drive. I have an idea. Were they round or oval?  A or B? You're sure? Stop fucking paging me, Claire! Don't say anything. And try not to look so stoned. Todd, I'm trying to explain what happened. They had already gotten stuff from somewhere else. It was just a case of miscommunication, I thought... That's fine. Todd, I'm really sorry about all this.  And here I thought you just gave me head. Pin me. Hi. I'm Kelly, and this is Donna. We were wondering if you might want to hang out. It's really smooth, isn't it? Donna's brother is a pharmacist. He got it for us. And you know what makes it even better? If you smoke a lot of pot. I mean a lot of it. We're out of that. We're down to chewable aspirin. Show me your tits. Four hundred. What's wrong? Mannie? Jesus. You're burning up. Listen to me. We're going to find Claire and get out of here. Sweetheart. Mannie. I'm going to leave you here. I'm going to get the car and come back for you. I can't carry you! Mannie, just hide here. Just like a little mouse, okay? You're going to be fine. Ain't nobody leaving. Todd, I can explain. It's not what it looks like. I mean, it sort of is, but it's complicated. I know I fucked up, but I can make it up to you. Please, Todd. I have the cash. I have more than I owe you. Mannie!! Mannie, I got it! I remembered who the fuck it was! Perry Farrell's dead girlfriend. Xiola Blue. X-I-O-L-A. Fuck, I knew there was one. Don't you get it? I win. Are you serious?  You got a bathroom? Hey. Okay, real mature. Claire. Alright. Mistakes were made. Things didn't go exactly as planned. Using you? You use me. Come on, if it weren't for me, you would be sitting home every night eating popcorn and watching reruns of 90210.  That is such bullshit. Mannie does not feel that way. Ask him. Ask him! Where is he? He drove you here, didn't he? Oh shit. Shit!  Mannie? Mannie? Mannie! Can you hear me? You fucked Todd Gaines?  Made out? Hello! He's a drug dealer.  You might have brain damage from overdosing. You shit. And twenty left over. Maybe I'll open a savings account. Merry Christmas, Mannie."
twins,VINCE ,Danny DeVito," Me, too. I love this new mattress. It's soft but it's hard at the same time. And I love this new clock. The curtains are the key to the whole thing. They're colorful... they're brilliant... they're... great curtains. CARLA  You were great last night, Vince. VINCE  Naaaw... (putting his arm around her) I think we're going to be very happy here. Suddenly we hear a DOOR downstairs as it OPENS, and a man's voice drifts up the stairs:  What's he doing back so early? You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet.  ... 'everything's going my way'... CUT TO: A lighter, just like yours.   I don't know what to say, Al.   I'm all choked up.  Good morning, Mr. Klane. I hope you're having a wonderful --  Yes -- no problem -- I have it. Yes. Today. Of course. 'Bye. Vince hangs up. AL What are you doing talking to a loanshark? VINCE  That's part of my good news -- You know that money I picked up from the Jaguar we boosted. Well,                      * I put the money in the stock                           * market. I got this incredible                          * tip.                                                   * CARLA Oh no.                                                    * VINCE I can't lose. Ever hear of P.V.T.                         * Industries? Probably not --                               * Secret takeover bid -- A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane                      * Brothers. CARLA  You borrowed from a loan shark to invest in the stock market? VINCE On margin -- And as of last night I was ten thousand ahead. I'm                        * going to make a fortune -- turn on the T.V. CUT TO: I'm a desperate man.                                    * Me? I laugh myself to sleep every night, and I never sleep alone. I'm doing great! The Owner smiles and turns. Vince continues counting the money, nervous as hell. Now -- CUT TO:  I am so sorry for all the miserable things I've done to you.  I didn't come here for a loan, sweetheart. I came to say goodbye. * It's not safe for me here. People are trying to kill me. Vince starts to rise but Linda pulls him back down. LINDA What did you do, Vince? I got involved in the stock market. LINDA  I promised Marnie I wouldn't give you money. Vince takes Linda's hand between his and stares into her eyes. LINDA Don't look at me like that... Don't do that with your eyes... I shouldn't even be here with you.  You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you... Linda. I only have eyes for you. LINDA  That is so beautiful. How do you make up that stuff? You're such a poet.  It's the baby Klane -- I gotta get the hell out. Burt Klane strolls to the middle of the room, then suddenly turns and faces Linda. BURT KLANE Where's the little shit? The rest is invested.     We're gonna make a fortune. Twenty -- ?   But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again. BURT KLANE That's just the interest.    The                       * twenty's the principal.                                * That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me -- LINDA It's your birthday?   Why didn't you tell me? VINCE  I can't take the kindness.    It gives me the shakes. LINDA You'll tremble plenty before we're through, Vince Benedict. They kiss.  World International Athletics                           * Representation. Vincent Benedict -- President. I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you wouldn't have to heist T.V. sets for a living -- listening, somewhat amazed.    Who is this loony?  -- Whoa. I still got another six hours to pay the money back. You                         * tell those crummy Klane brothers that harassing a man when he's already in the slammer is beneath even them -- JULIUS (overlapping -- they do this a lot) -- I don't know any Klane brothers. I'm your brother, Julius. VINCE  Huh?    Again? JULIUS I don't know any Klane Brothers.  Yeah.   Go on -- I got that part.  Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror. JULIUS We're not identical twins. I wouldn't be too sure.  I'm in fast company here --  Listen, you get me outta here, I'll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew, niece, grandma...  Just don't ask me to bend over -- Julius -- look -- ease up on the love talk or I'm gonna be tossing my cookies, all right? JULIUS Tossing cookies, that is more slang? VINCE Just gimme your wallet, okay? As Julius sweetly hands it over -- No, you don't. Actually, I was thinking I'm going to need some more money -- to put gas in my car -- We're brothers -- right? Julius tries to drape an arm around Vince's shoulder. Vince gives him a look. Julius drops his arm. TIME CUT TO: They arrest you, they put you                             * behind bars, they fine you and                            * then they hide your car.                                  * Yeah --   How'd you know that was my car.  Miss Busby -- Stacy -- this is a transition period for the corporation -- Why don't you take a few days off. MISS BUSBY  ... Aah -- all right. Whatever you say, Mr. Benedict... I hope you got some good news,                         * Al --                                                  *  Great, I'll be right over. Vince drops to his knees in order to replace the phone into its receiver. He then scrambles up, straightens his suit, heads for the door, making sure his pony tail is perfect. CUT TO: In agony, on his knees. It hurts to breath.       He finally manages to look up at the giant --  Did you hit me yet? 'Cause I didn't feel nothin'. Tell your brother 'He messes with me, he messes with my whole family!'  I like it when you hit people! JULIUS I hate violence. VINCE But you're so good at it. We ought to go into business together. You could be a boxer and I'll be your manager. JULIUS I don't think I could fight for money. VINCE No problem. You do the fighting, I'll keep all the money. JULIUS  I'm worried about you, Vincent. They reach Vince's Mustang and get in.  Why do you keep saying that? We're not twins, we're not brothers, we're nothing, and you're only in this car because I could use a little protection these days -- I don't know where my head is -- I forgot I promised this friend of mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his car at the airport -- do me a big favor, okay? Drive this car back from the airport for me. JULIUS I'd love to. Julius reaches into the glove compartment, takes out the car manual, begins speed reading it, running his index finger down the center of each page. VINCE What are you doing with that finger? JULIUS Learning to drive. Vince isn't sure what's going on at this point. Now Julius studies Vince's shifting moves, the way his hands work the steering wheel. Now he's back to the manual. Now he's staring at Vince. Vince and Julius's heads are both in motion now -- Julius's from the book to the wheel, Vince's from the road to Julius's finger. As their heads keep turning -- CUT TO: That dopey Sam -- He did it again. Forgot to leave the keys... A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed... You think we should do a thing like that?  I saw a guy from the auto club do this once... The door locks suddenly pop up in unison. VINCE Whaddya know?    Beginner's luck! As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots inside -- There's a supermarket up ahead. Take your foot off the gas and very -- very -- very gently put it on the brake. JULIUS The brake -- right. That's right... They all turn and look at Vince, who's pulled his cart up behind them. JULIUS  My twin brother, Vincent. Linda and Marnie, stunned, look from Vince to Julius. VINCE  God you look beautiful in this light. LINDA Vince... ?   I didn't know you had a brother.  Goodbye girls, see you soon. Yeah.   Kind of. JULIUS Is Marnie your girl friend, too? VINCE Marnie! Marnie hates my guts. She seemed to like you. That's the best way --   women love men who are mysterious   and devious. It keeps them on their   toes -- makes them excited you   know what I mean? JULIUS No. You do like women, don't you? Now correct me if I'm wrong. You're a virgin, aren't you? JULIUS That's private.  He's a 230-pound virgin.                              *  Alright! Alright! I got your food. Yes! 'Liver and Cheese,' 'Chicken Giblets,' all your favorites, Julius. JULIUS You named your cat, Julius? The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is adding a little extra cheese. I know you're probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon, but here on the mainland we just nuke it! Dinner is served! Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this. You go hunt down                       * Mom, I've got a cash flow problem                     * to deal with.  What! BURT KLANE We haven't forgotten about you, Benedict -- You better have our money tomorrow morning. Or else. VINCE Or else what? Suddenly, Vince's    living room WINDOWS EXPLODE in a burst of GUNFIRE. Vince     and Julius hit the floor and try to shield themselves    from the SHATTERING GLASS. The sound of a CAR SQUEALING    away outside the window. JULIUS Everyone seems so angry in America.  Sorry -- the car's been promised for a kid's charity. BODY SHOP OWNER Okay, four grand. As Vince starts to drive away: BODY SHOP OWNER  Okay -- Six thousand -- that's as high as I'm going... CUT TO: Look, Beetroot -- if we can't renegotiate we wither and die. I'm not delivering any goddam Cadillac without knowing for sure I got twenty for my cut. I guess twenty seems a little high to you. I'm a reasonable guy -- I'll take fifteen -- McKINLEY Listen to me, you poor excuse for a warmed over turd, a deal's a deal -- VINCE -- But -- CUT TO:  Beetroot?  'Going back to Houston, Houston, Houston...' Vince tosses the items into the back seat of the Caddy, just as Julius jogs up the driveway and collapses against the Caddie door. He's red in the face, completely drenched with sweat, gasping for breath, having run all the way from Bel-Air. VINCE  Jesus! JULIUS  Vince, the most amazing thing has happened. You scared the living shit out of me -- JULIUS I met one of our fathers. He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is.  A lot of places are on the way to Houston. I'll be back in a few days. Stay in my apartment. Run up my phone bill. Throw wild parties. Take advantage of me. You know -- you're right. This is fate -- destiny -- But there's no way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that --  Why does everybody have to like me so much? Vince gets out of the car and, although it kills him, tries to put on a happy face for Linda. LINDA Happy birthday, Vince. VINCE Oh please -- It's not my birthday anymore -- MARNIE Happy birthday, Vince.   Is Julius around? Okay, okay -- look, you can't tell anybody this -- not even your sister -- but I'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it. LINDA Like what? I got something in here --  -- I don't even know what it is -- that's worth a fortune! LINDA  A fortune! That's great! This ought to fit you. Julius removes the shirt he borrowed from Vince, who pretends to be horrified at the sight of Julius's huge muscles. VINCE Whoa -- get away from that window! There's women and children out there!  What is wrong with you? See if you can get us a room with a king-sized bed, okay? Linda smiles at him, and winks. Julius, misunderstanding the sleeping arrangements, leans out the window. Now promise me something.  Well, that's that. On to Houston. He leads a stunned Julius down the corridor, towards several armed security guards. Keep your voice down. This place is crawling with security --                              * No... CUT TO: ... How did you know my name? gazes at the ""blender"" we saw Traven demonstrating in 1953.  This must be where you made the milkshake... But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had two of us -- way to go, Mom. TRAVEN Wrong. The embryo split in two, but it didn't split equally. All                        * the purity and strength went into Julius. All the crap that was left over went into what you see in the mirror every morning. VINCE  Whoa -- I'm the crap? JULIUS It's not true, Vince. VINCE No, I want to hear this.  I'm left-over crap? I'm no good? You tellin' me I'm a side effect!?! My life just got flushed down the toilet. JULIUS You're wrong, Vincent. Your life's just about to begin. VINCE I'm genetic garbage. * I know this is a touchy subject                      * for you, Julius. But the fact is,                    * we don't look the same -- we don't                   * act the same, we don't talk the                      * same -- we don't dress the same.                     * JULIUS I know.  So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different.                             * JULIUS We had six fathers, Vince. We're different parts of a lot of different people. Vince is starting to get interested again. VINCE Yeah? JULIUS And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that. A family?   You really think so? With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas trees... Like this... You just got to try to be cool, you know? Try these on. Of course, but it's nice to make it official. JULIUS                                      * Tommorrow we're going to finally meet our mother. VINCE                                       * And tonight we celebrate! Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her. Girls like to dance. I guess you haven't done that before either. Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her. It turns them to putty in your hands. He shoves a chair out of the way, making a little room. VINCE Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet -- JULIUS  -- Thank you for this, Vince -- VINCE (a pained look on his face) -- I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet! -- Julius looks at his brother, then self-consciously takes his hands. VINCE I'll lead, you follow. Okay, one, two, three, turn...  ... put your arm here -- you're breaking my fingers -- you're not wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji -- don't clench your teeth -- Vince begins to take Julius through the steps slowly at first, then as Julius gains confidence they begin to sail round the room, and we -- CUT TO:  Well, you've learned to waltz. Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced. CUT TO: Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie? Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling sweetly at him. JULIUS Can I ask you a question? Piece of cake. You're nervous 'cause it's your first time. Perfectly natural. Hey, cut it out! Not in here! Julius releases Vince, who clocks the other man's reaction.  Go easy on the beer, okay? What are you talking about?    We didn't shoot anybody. That's kind of drastic, don't you think? Uh... we got cable TV, a fully stocked bar, free ice -- we're in great shape. JULIUS Where you going? VINCE I thought I'd just go and tuck Linda in for the night. Maybe read her a bedtime story.  Don't wait up for me.  -- Eighteen -- nineteen -- LINDA You sick or something? VINCE Julius gave me a few pointers --  -- Seventy-five -- seventy-six -- I don't need to exercise, but Mom's gonna see me for the first                       * time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my best. LINDA She'll love you whatever you look like. VINCE I know she will -- I have that effect on people --  -- One hundred and forty-three --                      * one forty-four --                                      *  -- I just hope she's not too disappointed in Julius -- he can't help how weird he seems at the start -- Hey -- I sleep great every night --  -- what if she's disappointed in me? LINDA  C'mere. VINCE  Five hundred.  Don't want to overdo. He goes into her arms. LINDA If she's disappointed in you, then she's a fake -- who could want more from a son? VINCE  You're right.  I couldn't do this without you, Linda. I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night -- Why don't we sleep on this, okay? I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow.  It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom. Good idea. One bunch from me, one from Jules.  You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age. Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell. A MALE CUSTODIAN answers the door -- friendly but very firm. We've come a long way. I can assure you she's going to be very happy to see us. CUSTODIAN I suggest you write a letter to the Benedict Foundation stating your business. The Custodian politely closes the door in their faces. VINCE                                     * A foundation? Please don't do that -- look -- this isn't one of your average everyday situations -- she's our mother is the thing. Twin sons. GARDENER -- You're comedians -- VINCE We're kind of a surprise. -- Is Mary Ann?  No, of course not.  Can we get the hell out of here? Do I look like a young artist to you, Linda? MARNIE  Vince, all she meant was -- VINCE  I know what she meant. And I know why she's here, too. It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money. LINDA You know that's not true.  Bull-shit. Julius, who's been quiet and distant throughout, suddenly intercedes. JULIUS Take it easy, Vincent.   It's not her fault. VINCE You hear that, everybody? The                          * creature from the black lagoon                         * just put in his two bits. I                            * should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place -- deal-of-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm driving around looking for a dead mother.  Family, my butt. There's no family here. There's just me and three losers -- I'm leaving. Okay, Beetroot -- It's time. I'll be there tomorrow -- where do we meet and trade? I thought we had a deal here. Five million dollars -- No way... this is bullshit...  Julius, you putz.  Goddam ESP-psycho-voodoo bullshit... Put the goddam gun away -- you're a multimillionaire. CUT TO: hands held high, appears, stands beside Julius. I am never going to forgive you for this. Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience! JULIUS Nobody ever said being good was easy. How am I going to survive out there? What are my friends going to think? Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. JULIUS I always knew you would. VINCE You're my brother, right?  We're family, right? JULIUS Thank you, Vincent. VINCE  We're a rich family, right?  -- I won't -- I won't feel one bit better -- I'll never feel better, not if I live to be... oh no --                         * As the sound of POLICE SIRENS get LOUDER we -- FADE TO BLACK. Linda, I -- LINDA What the hell are you doing here? VINCE You wouldn't answer     my calls or my letters, so I...     Look, I made a terrible mistake     and I apologize and I want to tell     you that I'm a changed man. Linda is almost buying it, but then -- LINDA How did you get in here? VINCE Well, there was a window in the back that -- All I ask is for another chance. I know I probably don't deserve it, but -- I had to break into your apartment, but -- The matter of you and me living together. Your place or mine? Just as long as they pay -- we're not running a charity, you know. Come in! Now that's a scary thought. They both yawn simultaneously once again."
amelia,AMELIA ,Hilary Swank," Adventurous? You've got the wrong girl, Mister. You should know that by now. Her eyes study him.    Assessing something as he pours himself four fingers. That why I get so many chances to not do it? He thought I hated him.      He never knew I was fascinated. I figured he'd be pompous. Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers, explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo of George with the great Lindbergh. A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises, smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down the corridor. I knew, of course, that he wasn't going to choose me. I had no discernible qualifications whatsoever. They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly pushes it open... ...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him, negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric, masterful. But to be rejected by this... parasite. A man who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous. He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is there. Sit, please. But she doesn't. I didn't know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk. He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze from him. He hangs up the phone. They stare at each other for a frozen beat.   He breaks the moment with a charming smile... Mr. Putnam? GEORGE I asked you to sit. Was that the thing you did with your hand? Sadly, I don't speak dog. His smile now only a trace.       But more genuine. I do. I'll make it. Always nice to know what the real attraction is. His smile.    Beginning to enjoy this conversation. Why would that matter? Was that your advice? Except for the part that goes to you. You said she wants a flyer. Why would anyone want a book from a passenger? Good for my chances, you said. What are my chan... You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam.     I can find my way. The look holds.   He shrugs.   You probably can. Fine.   What have I done? She watches his smile. I didn't mind waiting. Caught up on my reading. Knitted a sweater. We. Spoken like a gentleman. She steps up onto the train. Extends her hand like a man. He shakes it firmly. The train begins to move. She watches his cheery wave as she rolls away. Of course a gentleman. Would have paid for my ticket. Courage is the price that life exacts For granting peace We SUPERIMPOSE over her image the wall of a little girl's bedroom, filled with treasured NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS about women doctors, officials, bank presidents, women who had established themselves in positions previously thought to be available only to men. The soul that knows it not Knows no release From little things As the little red airplane passed by, it said something to me. Amelia beams.   She fills her lungs, transported. I don't think I've ever stopped listening. HOLD on her, hair and uniform whipping in the breeze. I even had my own plane. Bought with my last dime. At the apex of her climb, she FLIPS into a breathtaking LOOP THE LOOP, as... Course in the early days of flying... ...her engine SPUTTERS. Then STALLS.    The plane DIPS into a TAIL-SPIN, PLUNGING downward... ...crashing was so common, you almost forgot it could kill you... Amelia STRUGGLING to start the engine, the little plane HURTLING toward earth, SPINNING as it goes. ...until it did. The engine COUGHS to life and at the last second she SWOOPS harrowingly above the ground to SOAR FREE. Almost. Got it.   I think. You're just in time. Alice has come through the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well... They are, actually. She pats the grass beside her.   Sam has no choice but to sit. Has to be. Competition, you know. Millionaire heiresses, hot shot girl pilots. If George knew I told you, he'd have me publicly flogged. So long as he could sell tickets. He's not smiling. Marion. She's giving me a leave of absence. Specially if I don't make it. Well, I'll have impressive credentials as a long-distance passenger. That's not exactly a career in aviation. She looks up at his eyes. You do love to look on the dark side. Whatever did you see in a sunny character like me? She gives him a sweet playful smile.   It doesn't reassure him. What love means to you. What it requires. Is the pressure. He stops walking. The problem is what it's always been. The problem is me. George had told me Stultz was Adm. Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless, gifted. He drank. But George said it never affected his work. George waves as we approach.   Bill and Amelia seem locked on each other. When he said it, I must have had a funny look. So I just said, `Yeh, I grew up around a guy like that.' We felt `commander' was less grandiose than, say, `empress.' Bill doesn't smile.   The other man does... Hmmn.   What does that do to our fuel? I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not that I've ever had enough to try. Sorry.    I'll try keeping my mouth shut. Careful.    I could get to like it. No reaction from him. He hops into the boat. Turns, holds out his hand. She hesitates. Clearly doesn't need his help to jump into a boat. Their eyes lock. We are watching her decide. And then... She reaches to clasp his hand.   Hops down beside him. Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for everything. It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish. Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching. There's a Beatrix Potter story about a cat named Simpkin. PULL BACK to see the PHOTOGRAPHER, George beside him. They are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston. He wasn't happy unless he had several mice, each under a different teacup. So he could never become bored. We see that Amelia's POSE looks exactly the SAME as a photo of CHARLES LINDBERGH in the photographer's hand. It is labeled `LUCKY LINDY.' THe illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace. The photographer now shows George ANOTHER PHOTO of Lindbergh in a different pose. What are you boys doing over there? Oh god, is it worth the effort? He cocks his head, studies her.    Nah, guess not. Valentino's not available? He shakes his head sadly. Adjusts her collar once more. This time, his hands linger. Two things. One, Chaplin can't play me because he's perfect for you. And two, you have company. She glances to where a WOMAN, beautiful and aristocratic, is being helped onto the roof. George's face lights to see her. He rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her tenderly. Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them both. Popping off letters. For my dad, my mom, my sis. You know. In case. Who else? If I do pop off, it's your fault. Said in her sunny way. But she's not kidding.    It takes a beat before he can offer... Sam will handle that.   They trust him. That registers. Have you. But why is he you? Oh. So you haven't actually read it. Do you actually read? Well.   See ya. She walks off down the dock toward the Friendship. e stands watching her go. Our first hop was to Canada, to start from as close as we could get to Ireland. Just in case we couldn't get the thing in the air and had to row. She walks briskly down the corridor. The fuel was going to be so close, every single mile counted. Turns a corner.      Approaches the dining room door. George told me to keep to my room, just in case there was a reporter or two somewhere. She enters the hotel dining room. Stops cold. Across the room a disgruntled Bill and a sheepish Slim stare at her from their breakfast, surrounded by 15 REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. Holy shit. Half a dozen CAMERAS RISE as one. It is a defining moment. And Amelia... Cocks her head.      Throws an effortless golden smile. Hi there, boys. How are the ham and eggs? The FLASHES EXPLODE as one.   They keep POPPING as Amelia makes her way to them. Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a thought to someone like me? I don't have a single sweater made out of gold. The boys ROAR, Slim louder than anyone. Even Bill cracks a smile. They're shouting, teasing, YOU CAN'T KID US! Hey, not even silver. The boys make room.   Bill rises to hold Amelia's chair.    A friendly murmur... Time to fly. Get up, get dressed, we're going now. She is calm and angry at once.    A powerful combination.   Slim pulls his pants off a chair. Great. Maybe Mabel will think so, too. Because if she doesn't, she's going to Paris and you're going home. Today. It's fine, there's a tail wind all the way, we'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind gets us to Ireland. But this   is the day Mabel's ready, so we're   going now. The weather is going   to get better and we'll be there   to enjoy it. Just as serious as you're hung over.  You go now, get the late weather, we'll meet you at the plane. Go. Now! Slim pulls on his shoes, grabs his jacket, his bag. Looks to Bill, but the pilot is glaring at his commander. I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill. He is the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know. He's my father. Her eyes are burning with this.    And Bill keeps quiet. Anyone would. He's a drunk. And he's let me down all my life. She leans closer. Now you get out of that bed. And you fly that god-damned thing to Ireland. Or I swear to you, Bill... Just above a whisper... I swear to you I will. Or die trying. And either way. You're going to be living with it. Good.     Slim, start the engines. She still hasn't given the paper to Bill. Slim steps onto a pontoon. Starts CRANKING up the propellers. As the engine KICKS to life... You signed a contract. You've got a direct instruction from me to go. That report indicates some degree of risk and it's a risk I'm taking. Thanks. She motions to Slim, get on board. The navigator grins, starts to climb up, looking back at Bill... Read tomorrow's papers, Bill. We'll both be in them. And disappears. Alone on the dock, Bill hears the engines REV. Jesus, God, she's going to do it. He takes a step toward the plane, but her head appears in the hatch... So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right? Her perfectly straight, innocent face.    He BUSTS out laughing. This fucking girl. Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last grand adventure. I wish I had won, but it was worthwhile anyway. You know that.     I have no faith we'll meet anywhere again, but I wish we might. HOLD on the gray eyes.   DISSOLVE TO... LATER. Amelia at the window, still opaque with fog. Suddenly, the plane SWOOPS down toward a clearing in the clouds. There to the south, a FREIGHTER running across our path. No land in sight. Out of gas. May have to swim for Oh, yeh. Very important man.   More important than any of us. Really?    Yep. Public relations. Goes back to work.    DISSOLVE TO... LATER. Amelia sits with her papers in her lap, dangling her feet from the hatch. Alone. Hear the BUZZ of... ...a PLANE dropping slowly from the sky, gliding onto the water on its pontoons. She stares at it. Gathers up her things. LATER. Amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy, behind her the Friendship in distance. She is being rowed to shore. Our VIEW is over the back of the man rowing. Amelia is staring past him, vaguely apprehensive. REVERSE ANGLE. She's looking at TWO THOUSAND WELSHMEN swarming the docks. You can't even see the sand. The crowd is silent and staring. No cheers. As if they were staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo. Bill and Slim help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore. But when Amelia jumps out, the crowd... No, really, this is very sweet, it's an honor. I'm actually enjoying it. Hullo, Hilton. Railey stands back as FLASHBULBS catch the moment.   He's brought photographers with him. And more. I believe you've come for these. Both men regard the pages as if they were gold bullion.     Come for these indeed. I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise... This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record. This particular flight, under these conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off. But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man. Such calm self-possession.    Such confidence in that. Aviation is clear today for the pioneer. And if the pioneer has good ideas nobody will ask whether P            the pioneer is a man or woman. olite applause.       Mostly from women.   She looks around the room. I hear your doubt. That doubt is our challenge. This is where our Atlantic flight, or any other good flight by a woman can help... She nods.    To them, to herself. It starts women thinking. Guess you can burn those letters. Dorothy wonders.       Letters? The book's yours.     The letters are mine. He smiles.       Bows in submission. Barely enough for one. A battery of reporters and flashbulbs wait by our motorcade. Well, being a social worker by trade and passion, I'll be going back to work at Denison House when all this fun is over. She sends the guy a smile, and a dozen FLASHES catch it. ...if I haven't been fired. George holds the door of their limo. She looks up to him with a mischievous smile. And with no warning... ...Amelia bypasses the limo, climbs into the SIDECAR of a cop's motorcycle, and SMACKS its side. The cop looks up to George, who... ...nods, go for it. And the cop DOES, wheeling out into traffic, opening up the SIREN, as everyone laughs or cheers or darts into the street desperate for a fleeting photo. George watching her go.    Dorothy watching George. So they took me home with them to Rye. And I lived there, while I wrote my book. PULL BACK to see our view has been George's. He sits at an antique writing desk, watching her through a picture window. He rises slowly. We see that he has been reviewing a CONTRACT, which he takes with him. I thought he'd be a tyrant and that I would have to manage him. He smiles as he approaches.   She goes back to work. Instead he was kind and generous. And only picked the fights he needed to win. He drops the contract on her table.     She looks at it. What does it say?   `I don't smoke but you should?' True and misleading.      Why would I sign that? And another thing. Your hats. Are a menace. Staring at each other. GEORGE Everything about you. Is a menace. The stare holds.   Because this is the moment. I remember the first kiss. It is only one step.     Her hand goes to his chest.    Her eyes close, as... She brings her mouth to his.     Tender and strong.    And deep. It is an act of decision. A held look. No one smiles. We hear her name ANNOUNCED from the podium. But she keeps looking at him. And as the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she finally... ...turns. STRIDES onto the stage, with one graceful wave, she brings the applause to a crescendo. Of course, I knew all the stories But I didn't kiss him because I felt sorry for him. Or because it would mean the world to him. INTERCUT.   George in the wings.    His heart in his eyes. I did it.    Because I wanted to. He looks down.   He's still holding her cards. It's so good to meet you. I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration. Feel like a drink? Relax, George. I meant a Coke. As she leads Elinor into the sitting room of their suite, the girl's eye falls on the door to the bedroom. It is slightly ajar, revealing an unmade double bed. Unseen by the others, the kid reacts. Oh, my. All depends. On whether you want the sell or the real. Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip? Keep doing what you're doing. The girl nods, seriously.    Okay. For a long, long time. I can't do that. I already love you.    That's why I can't marry you. GEORGE Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were stuck for an excuse. I know me.     And you don't.   Not really. The day will come. When I will run away. And when it does... He stops her with a kiss. And when were you going to tell me? GEORGE Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. She can scarcely believe this. What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work? Because I'm no angel. Business is competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you're there making this life happen for me, but... But this is different. It is. If women are going to stab women in the back, then women are going nowhere. You did it because you love me. That stops him. And when we're married, you mustn't ever... Now she stops.      Because his eyes are wide. What's the big shock? I thought you wanted to get married. Full beat. Well, then. His eyes moving over her face. You'll be destroyed. And part of me will, too. And I think we both know it. And yet. Sometimes things happen that way. You're not better safe than sorry. Tears stand in his eyes.       He is so happy. Yes? GEORGE Hell yes. ...I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me. Nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly. Snow falling.    Absolute silence. If we can be honest I think the difficulties which may arise may best be avoided should you or I become interested deeply, or in passing, with anyone else. She gazes intently, her heart in her eyes.     He never looks up. Please let us not interfere with the other's work or play, nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements. And then... I will try to do my best in every way. And give you that part of me you know and seem to want. He folds the letter carefully.    Places it in his pocket.       And smiles. Hence, the article. Ah.   He nods. I'm thinking of doing it solo. Would you mind? He butters his toast. I'm surprised you're all right with this... WIDEN ANGLE.     George kneeling beside her.   Happily planting his own. Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the lecture. Five years since Lindbergh, no one's made it solo, so many of them died. He looks at her work. Reaches over. Starts packing the earth HARDER around her plant. She just watches, then... I was waiting to hear that I'm only doing this because I was just a passenger last time, and I'd rather die than go on living as a fraud.. No one cracks a smile. It's like Laurel and Hardy in a food fight where each lets the other take his best shot. George I think luck has rules. And I try to respect them. My favorite is... She glances up. We make our own luck, you and I. Remember that. He will remember that.    And more. No. He pulls out a twenty dollar bill.      Hands it to her. All this? G Thank god, I thought you were going to tear it in half. I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh? He shakes his head. GEORGE Either way, something to look forward to. She puts her hands on his face.    She doesn't want to leave him either. Stake up the peonies, huh? They're messy when they bloom on the ground, and... And. AMELIA I want to see their heads high. When I come home. She leans up to kiss him. And again.    Feeling in her eyes that he will never forget. See ya. The weather report wasn't perfect. But we knew our real chance was to take weather that others wouldn't. Ahead, towering CLOUDS in moonlight.   Too high to fly over. I closed the deal by choosing May 20, five years to the day from Lindbergh's flight. It was too good a sell for George to resist. 5              What we didn't know... ...was that my altimeter would conk out. Never to return. The only way to have any sense of altitude, was to keep dropping toward the sea. When the engines sputtered, that was my low-level limit. A sudden JOLT knocks her OUT of her seat. She scrambles back, as we see WHITECAPS A FEW FEET BELOW. She JERKS the nose UP, the engine COUGHS... ...and CLIMBS. I was too busy to grasp how impossible the situation had become. The joke was... LATER.   Flying in and out of cloud cover. All those months flying only with instruments, I should have been practicing without them. PAN to the windshield. A small GLOW at the surface of a vibrating engine. Amelia hasn't noticed. I started to wonder if luck was paying me back. For thinking I knew the rules. A small BLUE FLAME LICKS out into the night. Then I smelled burning oil. She sees it now. The flame coming through a broken weld in the manifold ring.  A I told myself, push on. After all, if it was a stupid choice... LATER. Flying in blackness.    Rising, as the engines seem sluggish. ...no one would ever know. Suddenly, a FILM of SLUSH on the windscreen. With seemingly no warning, there was ice. The controls froze. And the Vega DIVES into a DIZZYING SPIN. Through the spin I had one thought, it would be warmer lower, the ice would melt, I just had to regain control... ...before I hit the water. And ARCING at last to SWOOP above the whitecaps.   Way close for comfort. SMASH CUT TO... ...or passed out. ...SMELLING SALTS, she inhales, again, blinks, starts to climb... The ice happened twice more, and I began to lose heart. Then I remembered Lindbergh's book saying the same thing happened to him. So I figured, if he's twice as good, I just have to be twice as lucky... I'd read that part in George's reception room that first day. Bless him for keeping me waiting. The FUEL GAUGE reads EMPTY. She switches on the RESERVE TANK. And as she DROPS back down into opaque clouds... ...she feels something. Her fingertips go to her left shoulder, and come away... Wet.   Slick. The cockpit gauge was defective. There was a steady trickle of fuel down my neck. She looks around helplessly for a way to stem the dripping. Toss-up whether the bigger danger was running out of gas or going up in a fireball. I had my answer in less than an hour, when... The manifold weld began to separate. I gauged the likelihood of explosion at somewhere between probable and inevitable. Excuse me, sir. Where am I? A blink.   The truth... When I left, I was aiming for Paris. Oh. MAN Ya missed, y'know. `Only an average flyer, she has pushed herself to the front by following the tactics of the feminists... She looks up to him. Well, it reminds me how much I owe to the men of this world. Keeps me humble. What have we really done? That's not enough. The World Telegram said, `a magnificent display of useless courage.' Reasoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage. He nods to himself. Ladies. Thursday, I'll be in Boston. Meeting Gene Vidal and Paul Collins. Said lightly. Not even looking at him.     While through the glass, it's become quite a tussle. No, he's starting a shuttle service. Washington, New York, Boston... One woman goes flying from view, as a younger one gets her place. Could be a money maker for us.    Get me off the lecture grind. He stares in her eyes.   Almost as if looking for something. What on earth would you need me for? She's making a real mess of the lobster.    Gene notices.   PAUL COLLINS doesn't... Gene had a terrible marriage and was separated from his alcoholic adulterous wife. But he was too kind to humiliate her with a divorce... Gene drains the last of his beer. As a result, he was basically a single parent to their young son, Gore. He glances at his watch.      Wow. How's Nina doing? If you two get bored, I could tag along sometimes. Well, yeh. He smiles first.    Hers is slower, but here it comes. Any given meal, I can eat a lobster and have you boys in stitches. A full beat.    He's deciding. At seven? Are you kidding, it's a godsend. No matter how hard George and I work, how many lectures we cram in, there's never enough money for the next adventure. He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there.     His eyes seem to convey a depth of understanding. Wish you'd do something about that. I know.   Always. We don't have to. For understanding. There is no smile. Without a word, she goes into her room. CLOSES the door behind her. e stands alone. Do I knock on that door?     Then, smiles to himself, and simply... Walks away. The wrong Roosevelt got elected. I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it. Said casually, looking at her plate. his could be one of those rare instances. When the most accomplished candidate. Turns out to be male. Glances up for the reaction. How do you feel about flying at night? Eleanor's eyes register the change of topic.     Rolling with it... Outstanding. Put your hands on the wheel. Eleanor looks over.   Are you serious? It's dual controls.   No one will ever know. Hesitation. Don't you trust me? And slowly, Eleanor's fingers close on her wheel.     Amelia's hands come away from hers. I feel like a Coke.   Can I get you something? And stands up. Only the trace of her smile as the pilot's eyes WIDEN in absolute shock. Do try not to hit the ground. Have I told you what a perfect job ou did on the peonies? They're miraculous. Sorry. When are you leaving? I don't really see how I can. Well, it's not just that. There's y work on the shuttle, we're at a critical stage, and...I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch... She knows he's watching.    Shakes her head.    Keeps on working. What are you trying to say? I can't think of anything helpful. He nods.   Well, then.      Rises slowly... Walks back toward the house, his garden tools forgotten.          She stares after him. Hi. I suppose I thought.      It was too revealing. WIDEN ANGLE. Gene enters the room with a drink in his hand and sits down next to her, concerned by her obvious distress. AMELIA I'm so glad you have it now. Of course. Me, too. I'll call you later. She hangs up slowly. The tears begin to fall.    She looks at Gene helplessly. Then stands without a word. Walks out into the yard. Must be the ambience.   And the nuts. Any guy would have to be nuts to do that. I'm considerable trouble, if you haven't noticed. You'll see it. Gore, huh? I wish. Do you? Would make life simpler. She throws a peanut which BOINKS off his face.    He smiles a suddenly goofy, very non-elegant smile. Actually, I'll be in Indiana. Edward Elliot of Purdue wants me to build a women's careers department there. Really?   He likes that. I'll be back and forth. When I'm there, I've asked to stay in the dorm with the girls. What's special about now? Not unless someone makes me. How thoughtless of me to be doing ll this in a society where no one else is interested in making money. Present company included. He's not afraid of her. If this is about George, just say o. Because we made those calls, nd we includes me. And what's your point? Women are eld to some higher standard? Bankers and industrialists are ad- mired for succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping? ENE Of course they are. Well, let's change that, shall we? r would you just prefer to adopt t, since groveling would be easier. Staring at each other. Thanks for the tip. Well, I'm an open-minded girl. And o prove it, I'm hereby resigning as your consultant at the S            Aeronautics Branch. he throws some money on the table for the drinks. The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together. She stands up. Next time you read the papers.      Try reading between the lines. Walks out.       Gene makes no move to follow.   He's said his piece. I came to Washington today with the National Women's Party, to ask the President for his aid in passing the Lucretia Mott Amendment for equal rights. She waits for the press to quiet. And that's because I haven't needed it. The winsome smile. I'm the lucky one. Our Department of Commerce shows no prejudice in issuing licenses to fly. A pilot is a pilot. And now it fades. How about giving the rest of our women. The ones who can be productive for their families and for our nation an equal break? She is not defiant.      Gentle and strong. They are your sisters and your daughters. They are your wives. And fellas... The smallest shake of her head. You've no excuse. And you know it. ...including them wanting us to say darn instead of damn. Laughter.   The girl flushes a little, her point is a crucial one... Don't. She meant that.      And no one is laughing now. Build your career first. And, surprisingly, that's the best thing you can do for your eventual marriage. So many eager faces, so many disturbed ones. Look. It starts with a strong sexual attraction, that the oman assumes must be love. Some heads are nodding.   Some eyes suspicious. Everything works until the first financial crisis jars the man's confidence and threatens the oman's security. Why...? She looks from one to the next. Because she can't help. All she can be is dependent. Because that Trust me. Only a husband talks like that. In their laughter, she goes to the phone.      EVERYBODY hangs on every word of... AMELIA Yes?  Yes. Yes... (hand over phone, to the I'm flying in Tuesday. Yes, of course, I'll make time. Can you women keep a secret? They can.   And boy, do they want to hear one. Well, it's no secret that I'm a bit driven, some might say obsessive, about my little flying adven- tures... They are nodding, wide-eyed, go on. I've decided to embark on easily the most exciting, possibly cra- ziest, ever... They hold their breath. I'm going to fly. Around the world. A frozen beat for them to even absorb this. They BURST into WILD APPLAUSE, Amelia beaming, as we DISSOLVE TO... Are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I have to get physical? Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... May as well be a billion. And your surprise is, you robbed a bank. Think I could help? He looks in her eyes. Cat food.    A whole case. Dear Mr. President: Some time ago I told you and Mrs. Roosevelt about my confidential plans for a world flight. The chief problem is the jump westward from Honolulu... As President Elliot has said, it would be a shining adventure, beckoning with new experiences. Making me more useful to the program here at Purdue. She looks into the eyes of each in turn... It is much more. I believe that women should do for themselves what men have done - and occasionally what men have not. Yes? This might encourage other women toward greater independence of thought and action. And I know how deeply you gentlemen desire that. There is gentle laughter.   Amelia reacts in mock surprise. I know, of course, from my chats earlier in the evening. With each of your wives. More laughter.   Applause from a wife, then the others, then all. In that spirit, I want each of you to reach for your checkbooks... She regards their amusement.   And losing none of the warmth of her own smile... I mean that quite literally. This is an opportunity for me to exhibit the quality my husband admires most. The capacity. To be relentless. Well, there's Magellan, 400 years go. Actually, he didn't make it. And he died. And he used a boat. Pretty much. He glowers at her.    She glowers back. So why are you asking? Just to show how smart you are? No one's tried it.    You think I should? No answer. Dare me. Okay. Is she serious?       She seems to be. I'll have to refuel. In the air. One plane to another. The boy is staring at her now.       Staring. Well, don't you think I can? A beat. Pretty much. HOLD on Gene.   He smiles at his kid... We'll play some cards before you leave. Okay, then. He waves. One more glance at dad, and Gore goes. Gene gestures for Amelia to come with him, away from the mechanics. What's up? But he's already walking to... ...a little folding table, off in a corner.     She follows. Sits. Well...?       G s that an opinion or an order? His rueful smile. Oh, I bet there are more advantages than just that. No one's backing down on this. I've taken bigger risks. It's your vacation home. Don't rush me. I'm thinking. Hullo, Fred. It's good to meet you. She holds out her hand. He juggles the mugs, so he can shake it. Strong look in each other's eyes. Hands her a mug... This time of day, I like it with bacon and eggs. His slight grin.       A handsome guy. Over easy on the eggs.      Your job could depend on it. Silence between them.       Comfortable smiles. I'm told that mid-air refueling would be beyond my abilities. Better odds of hitting that island? Even with cloud cover? They did. My dad drank. He lied all the time. Rest his soul. Bill just had to find Europe. We're looking for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet. He shakes his head. Did I pressure the navy to build a landing strip at Howland Island? How exactly would I do that? L         Threaten not to"

It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg. All the years I worked the Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed Up in one shooting.  Just one.  A Man got killed.  Wasn't my fault, Just doin' my job.  I don't even Know if it was my bullet that Dropped him, but... I don't kno, It's sort of hard to explain.  At First I just felt funny, you Know, kind of clammy inside.  But When it finally sunk in what I'd Done... Believe me, boy, you Don't ever want to feel that way. Not ever.  Didn't even make a dent, did I?  You're both makin' a big mistake. This Hooker's ranch? You seen anything of a man on Horseback leading a black Stallion?

Don't want any more trouble, Ringo. I'm not gonna fight you, there's No money in it.  Sober up.  Come On, boys. Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there. That didn't sound like thunder. Virgil? It's all my fault.  If I hadn't been So damn smart, if I'd just... Oh God, Virge, I'm so sorry. Virgil, what am I going to do? No?  Brothers to the bone, right? Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'? Morg, use your head. I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out. I just got it fixed. No, no!  Get the doctor!  Jesus Christ! Oh, no, get her out of her!  Jesus! Somebody shut that dog up! Will somebody get the damn dog out- Easy Morg, don't think about that now. Morgan?  Morgan! No, no, get away, get away from me... Whore!  Filthy whore!  Get away From me! I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back. Carthage, really?  I'm from Monmouth. If the Lord is my friend. Know why you're here? They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.  I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those. Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen. The minute we start we'll be Going against local and county Law.  If we fail the U.S. Government won't be able to lift A finger to help us.  Nevertheless I want you to understand we carry The full force and authority of The law of this land. Raise your right hands.  Do you Solemnly swear to uphold the laws And constitution of the United States of America and to protect her citizens to the best of your Ability, even at the cost of your Own life? All right, let's wring 'em out! United States Marshals!  Reach! One more word and I'll blind you. Get over there! All right, run 'em off. All right, breed.  Dig in.  Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours. Drop his horse. A human life.  Twelve dollars. Look at him.  That's how you'll All end up if you don't get it Through your head: it's over, The Cowboys're finished.  Forever. So tell the others and get out of The Territory 'cause next time I Leave no one alive.  Understand? No one.  You been warned.  All right, burn it!  Everything! Leave that trash where it lays. I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there? We'll see about that. Wait... wait... steady... Now! Lay on! Come on! So he can tell the story. There's no reasoning with him. They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs. We'll go around that way, come up on foot. No. No. No... No... No... No! No! No... No... I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know. Sure... Mounts're getting jaded.  We're Gonna have to find a place to Rest 'em up. Doc... Grab him. Horse're pretty well fagged and We got a sick man with us. Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about... You did.  Well... thank you. Wait! Goodbye. Damn... Damn! See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason. Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust. We should get moving. I don't like it. You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there. I made a promise. But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would. What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does? So what does he want? Revenge?  For what? Remember how I said it all Happened so fast with Curly Bill I didn't have time to think about it? Well I've had plenty of time To think about this.  I spent most Of my life since I was born not Knowing what I want out of life, Just chasin' my tail.  But now, For the first time I know exactly What I want.  And who.  And that's The damnable misery of it.  I can't beat him, can I? That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry. They're not givin' you any safe Conduct.  Soon as the shooting Starts kick east for the New Mexico line.  Well... I know.  Me neither. Dear God, this is the last Battle.  I worked it out in my Head every which way and I know There's no way I'm comin' through This alive.  You've preserved me This far so I only ask one more Favor: just let me live long Enough to kill that man.  Thy will Be done and there's an amen to it. What happened? All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way. So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us. How you feelin', Doc?  Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad. All right, Doc... All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life. That's great coming from you. Then what do I do? All right.  Then what? Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven. I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life. There.  It'll come up over that ridge. Get ready, here it comes!  Here it comes!"
capote,TRUMAN ,Philip Seymour Hoffman," So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot of his book, and he says to me: the writing's going well, but I just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't you call that a problem? Oh, I've got a million ideas of what to write next -- I just have to choose one. No. When a movie is made of my life I know exactly who I want as me...  Marilyn Monroe. William Shawn, please.  Adorable one? All of a sudden I know what article I'm going to write for you next. ...never had anything like this happen to them before. They're used to sleeping at night with the doors unlatched....  Yes, we should buy stock in Master Locks -- all of Kansas will be in the hardware store tomorrow. They have no idea who the killer is. But it doesn't matter who the killer is -- what matters is who the townspeople imagine the killer is. That's what I want to write about. I'm gonna need some help... I'm thinking about Nelle -- she can protect me... I want to leave tonight... God I'm glad you agreed to come. You're the only one I know with the qualifications to be both a research assistant and personal bodyguard.  Oh, Nelle, you poor thing. That one up there and that one on the floor. You're sweet. Thank you. You're very kind. What?  How'd you know? How did you know?! You think that was too much?  I thought that was a good line. Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of Investigation. KBI. Mr. Alvin Dewey, please. Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the New Yorker. Hello. Bergdorf's. The scarf. Thank you.  I wonder when we could arrange an interview? Some time to talk. We're not looking for any inside information -- I don't care one way or another if you catch whoever did this -- I'm writing an article not about the Clutter killings, but how they're affecting the town, how you all are bearing up -- Excuse me? Yes -- Of course. Magazines don't give out -- Mr. Dewey's protective of the Clutters. I wonder how well he knew them... He was foxy with that old man.  Are you ever gonna let me drive?  Not even a little bit. Hello. What -- You hate my friends. I saw the bodies today. The Clutters. I looked inside the coffins. It comforts me -- something so horrifying it's freeing. It's a relief. Normal life falls away.  But, then, I was never much for normal life -- People here won't talk to me. They want someone like you, like Nelle. Me they hate. Well -- My point exactly. Is that so? I've been getting a lot of that lately. Oh, it's the hardest -- when people have a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise. Since I was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way I look and the way I talk. They're always wrong.  Do you know what I mean? Not one person here understands her. The end of a life. ""Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible ever happened to him before. "" I have 94 percent recall of all conversations. I've tested myself. I don't snore -- You don't hate me. Apparently Detective Foxy's wife has a better opinion of me than Detective Foxy.  Thank you for having us. More. More. Yes, but we who know the truth will love it. I only lived there for a short while but my Mama was born and bred. What did Mr. Dewey think? How very foxy. Mama would've put in half the bottle by now. Hello. I was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in Italy. I'd work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day's scenes. Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar -- -- where he and John drank every night -- -- and I mean drank, like famished water buffaloes. Well -- I'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me I had a phone call. It was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died. I flew home to New York -- terribly distraught -- but when I got to the apartment I could see that Joe was in even worse shape than I was. He grabbed my hands and sat me down at the kitchen table, and he said to me, ""Talk. Talk about anything, any subject in the world. Don't worry whether it will interest me or not. Just talk so I won't break down."" And I did. He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts. It was too painful. Who would put a pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him? Why would they tuck Nancy in?  You don't have to worry. I'm not going to write about this until everything's over. Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent me in New York? And I was right. She just heard Lipincott wants to publish it. Congratulations. (covers phone, mouths to Nelle:) Jealous. I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it was hard at first, but now I'm practically the mayor. I want to come home -- I do. Though if they catch whoever did this, who knows what -- I'll probably be here til next Christmas. Jack, we'll go away this spring to write. Maybe Spain... Bye.  The poor boy misses me. Nelle. I was never a kid. I was born fully formed.  -- girdle up -- no extra bulges -- if you're dressed right for him when he gets home, the evening should be smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals. I've trained myself. I have 94 percent recall.  You cut that out. Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd be left alone this morning by that hard-working husband of yours.  So I have breakfast.  I have news.  And I have literature. My friend Jack mailed me the book you wanted. They put you in the women's cell. Well... she's a good cook. I think so am I. A little bit. I'm sorry.  His feet don't touch the floor. Why are they doing that?  Madame Sanderson. Was it your choice to waive the hearing? You still need some?  Give me your hand. Would you like some water? Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book -- Who did? Okay. What's been your first impression? From you?  I just want permission to talk.  Has anyone else visited? Will you tell me if you need anything? I can have whatever you want sent from New York.  Will you do that? Gorgeous? I'm writing a book. It's too much for a single article -- this town, the killers most of all -- you will be stunned by Perry Smith -- Not much yet, but I know. I can sense him. He's desperately lonely, frightened... I have questions -- are you ready? How much more money can you send me? How quickly can you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures? I have the perfect place for it, over the hearth. You think he slept at all? I need to see him before we go. They're going to transfer you up to Lansing today. You'll have to make sure to put me on the visitor's list. Otherwise I can't see you. Will you do that? I'm going to help find you a proper lawyer. You need a serious lawyer for an appeal.  They took Dick last night. I need you to get him to do the same thing -- put me on the visitor's list. Will you do that, Perry? Perry. He's little, but terrifying -- He's as short as I am. And almost as pretty. I'd be with him right now but he's being given new accommodations -- Most people assume he's a monster. I don't see him that way. The book I'm writing will return him to the realm of humanity -- it's the book I was always meant to write... ...I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week. I had to break it to her that, of the four Matisses hanging on her wall, two were upside down. Another.  To answer your question, I'm following ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" by blazing a different path -- by inventing an entirely new kind of writing: the non-fiction novel. On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did they do that? It's been suggested that this subject is tawdry -- it's not worthy of literature. I disagree. Two worlds exist in this country -- the quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men -- the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those worlds converged that bloody night. I spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence. I spent hours talking to the killers -- and I'll spend more. (waiter brings his drink) Researching this work has changed my life, altered my point of view about almost everything. I think those who read it will be similarly affected.  Such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction -- You're really very clever. Perry's decided to appeal. He claims their attorney was incompetent -- that he never raised the issue of temporary insanity. They're facing execution in six weeks, Jack. They need someone to argue whether or not that's right. I'd also like to see them alive, yes, thank you very much. I need to hear their story. If you met him you'd understand. It's as if no-one's ever asked him a single question about himself. He's so... damaged -- and strange -- unexplored...  I don't trust this Hickock fellow. Perry's the only person who can describe to me what happened that night. I need to hear him say it. I'm finding them a lawyer. What are you talking about? No one told me. When can I see him? No. That's no good. I need to see them now, then whenever I want for as long as I want. I see. I understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be -- on this institution, and on the People who pay for it. I want to be clear that I don't expect the citizens of Leavenworth County to have to shoulder that burden. To be dispensed as you see fit. You're a kind and generous man. Hello. That's fine. Thank you.  I don't care what your plans are for yourself... But you're gonna wake up enough to tell me what you did with my tie. It's okay. It's Truman. It's your friend. How'd you learn to draw like that? Who took care of you as a child? That's your sister? We're not so different as you might think. I was abandoned repeatedly as a child. My mama'd drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man she'd met. Night after night she'd lock me in the hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what. I was terrified -- I'd scream my head off -- till finally I'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and fall asleep. After years of this she just left me with relatives in Alabama. My Aunts.  That's when I met Nelle -- she lived next door. (looks again at the photo, hands it back) Your mother was Indian? Drinking was not a good thing for her. And your father? What I can't decide is if you understand how fascinating you are. I hope we're past that now. You had me worried. I don't care about the tie. It's just a pity because it looked so good on you. Alright -- You wouldn't. I want to take your notebooks with me -- I want to read them. If I leave here without understanding you, the world will always see you as a monster. I don't want that -- I don't see you that way. This is remarkable. He trusts me -- that's why he gave it to me. He's given me absolutely everything.  You should see his drawings, Nelle, how good he is. He wants so badly to be taken seriously, to be held in some esteem. Do I what? Well... he's a gold mine. I mean he's told me his entire life, and now it's all here for me to write down -- All of the history I need. His entire life in this Diary. His dead mother. A brother and sister killed themselves. I tell him everything. We've been talking our heads off the past month. Sometimes, when I think how good my book can be, I can hardly breathe.  Here's what I wanted to read to you: ""If Called Upon to Make a Speech:"" -- this is exactly what I was talking about -- a speech just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement: ""If Called Upon to Make a Speech: I can't remember what I was going to say for the life of me. I don't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very, very glad. It's a wonderful moment and a rare one. Thank you!""  There's an exclamation point on the end of that thank you, in case you didn't catch it...  Where'd you go? I never said it was.  Listen to this... You look good, healthy again. I've decided on a title for my book. I think you'll like it -- very masculine. ""In Cold Blood."" The former, among other things. I've been wanting to ask if you'll let me look at your investigation notes. I heard this morning. Alvin. Do you not want me to look at your notes? You are permitted to say no. It was as much for me as for anyone. I couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon. I haven't written a word yet. Research. Waiting to talk to you. I had hoped -- The book? (looks directly at him) I have no idea. If I'm going to write about you -- if I'm going to determine how to write about you -- you need to tell me about that night at the Clutter house. Perry. Why? Do you worry what I'll think? Is that it? I know a lot of people. What is that you keep drawing? Perry, I have invitations to be in Morocco, Greece... I choose to be here. Those people have everything, all their prayers have been answered, yet they're more desperate than ever. I prefer to be here with you. I'm just missing this one piece, Jack. Be patient with me. I don't know. Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me. I will. I will. Bye. I can't. I brought you some things, but I have to fly back East. An hour. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your writings are magnificent. I hope these help you do more. I have so much material -- from the trial, from our visits, your journals. I have to organize it all, and I have to start the process of writing.  I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall.  I miss you already. Write me every five minutes. What. I'm already well into the third part, but I -- I can't finish that till I convince Perry to describe the night of the killings to me. I was planning to visit this fall, see -- And we all need to see how this ends for the final part. I can't finish the book till I know what happens. If Perry and Dick are executed it's one thing -- and if not, well -- I really don't know -- Right. Yes. Right. Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in the house. Why aren't you working? Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot. My man, my hero, my talented... My man... You are the hardest worker, the most unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes by on her way to London to sell her book which needs no selling, may a little of her success rub off on both of us. I don't know. From Perry. Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday. That's a terrible thing to say.  I used to write him all the time. I've been so focused lately on the book. Jack says I'm using Perry, but he also thinks I fell in love with him when I was in Kansas. How both of those things can be true is beyond me. I don't know how to answer that... It's as if Perry and I started life in the same house. One day he stood up and walked out the back door while I walked out the front. With some different choices, he's the man I might have become.  I'll see you at the reading in New York. Can't it be both? They said it was not paying his taxes. But really for being an outsider -- refusing to go along. You don't have to read any of these if you don't want to. But I thought you'd like something decent. You're much too smart for adventure magazines. In. -- in front of the television. They were watching Father Knows Best. I'm so sorry I've been away. I know. I have to be in New York anyway. Very slowly. I've hardly written anything. No.  Thank you. Hello. My name is Truman Capote. Perry Smith's voice was both gentle and prim -- a voice that, though soft, manufactured each sound exactly -- ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parson's mouth. The village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas, a lonesome area that other Kansans call ""out there."" Until one morning in mid-November 1959, few Americans -- in fact, few Kansans -- had ever heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of the [Arkansas] river, like the motorists on the highway... exceptional happenings had never stopped there. The four coffins, which quite filled the small, flower-crowded parlor, were to be sealed at the funeral services -- very understandably, for the effect... was disquieting. Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet, her brother a bright plaid shirt; the parents were more sedately attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe; and -- and it was this especially that lent the scene an awful aura -- the head of each was completely encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary blown- up balloon, and the cotton, because it had been sprayed with a glossy substance, twinkled like Christmas- tree snow. Imagination, of course, can open any door -- turn the key and let terror walk right in. [One] Tuesday, at dawn, a carload of... strangers, ignorant of the local disaster -- were startled by what they saw as they crossed the prairies and passed through Holcomb: windows ablaze, almost every window in almost every house, and, in the brightly lit rooms, fully clothed people, even entire families, who had sat the whole night wide awake, watchful, listening. Of what were they frightened? ""It might happen again."" Thank you. I was going to say the same thing! Tennessee loved it. Should we do more? I was terrified, but -- I think so. You know they're scheduled for next month? I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll get Perry to talk -- It really is too awful. Institutionalized sadism. As strange as it may sound to you, I'm going to miss him. When did you hear? Perry, sit down. For a minute.  I need you to talk to me... Perry. Perry. I know what exacerbate means. There is not a word, or a sentence, or a concept, that you can illuminate for me. There is one singular reason that I keep coming here -- ...November 14th, 1959. Three years ago. Three years. That's all I want to hear from you.  This is ridiculous.  I'm ready.  I have a plane to catch. I found your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful. This is my work, Perry. I'm working. When you want to tell me what I need to hear, you let me know. They've never seen these pictures? I don't think life works that way. When was the last time you saw him? Do you think I could borrow one of those pictures?  Alright. Hello handsome. Yes I don't... I don't know what you're talking about. Who sent that to you? Who sent that to you? It is my business, because it's not true. The organizers of the reading needed a title. They picked one -- a sensational one, I admit -- to attract a crowd. Yes. I haven't chosen one yet. How could I choose -- How could I choose a title when you still haven't told me what happened that night? How could I? I couldn't possibly. I have something from your sister. She misses you. It's alright. I'll go in. I'm sorry. I should have told you what they made me call the book.  I couldn't pretend to be your friend. The truth is, I can't help wanting to be.  You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to. Added up, how much money did you get from the Clutters? Jack. Jack. ...I want to give it to you. The truth is, I'm desperate to be done with it... Mr. Shawn, I... I've spent four years of my life on this book... They got a stay of execution yesterday... Another, yes.... Supreme Court.... ...It's harrowing -- all I want is to write the ending and there's no fucking end in sight... No. No, I haven't been drinking again... Put it with the others. Nelle.  Please, another. Terrible. Well. It's torture. Torture...  ...what they're doing to me. Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe it? If they win this appeal I will have a complete nervous breakdown. I may never recover. Just pray things turn my way. It's torture. They're torturing me. I frankly don't know what the fuss is about. Hello. Yes? Yes. Oh.  Uh... Yes. Yes. I'm here. Hello, Perry. I didn't... I hadn't heard that. I'm sorry. I don't know if I can. I'll try.  I don't know if I can. Come with me. I don't know what you must think of me. Yes.  It would be. I don't know. Do you want me to? Okay. Then I will. I did everything I could. I truly did. Goodbye, Perry. Someday I'll tell you about it. For the moment, I'm too shattered. It was a terrible experience and I will never get over it.  There wasn't anything I could have done to save them."
traffic,ROBERT ,Michael Douglas," Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client didn't show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney... Lately the only variation I'm hearing in your argument is the name of the client.  And you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants.  Furthermore, there is no sacred protection of property rights in the United Sates.  When you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm, whether it's one joint or an acre of plants, your property can be seized and your property can be sold. Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of advice?  The next time you argue this point before this court, regardless of my whereabouts, I recommend you have something up your sleeve other than your arm. Depends who it's from. You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me. (re: the elaborate box) Definitely third category. Depends on the state. Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical? Not by me. I'll be sure to let you know. Like you protected Landry? You've done a fine job here, Sir. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is in better shape than when you found it. There are a lot of encouraging statistics.  The work's just started, but I intend to see it through. You've got my word on that. I've come in to do a tough job and that's what I'm going to focus on.  That's very interesting.  Like you. You're looking pretty good for an old guy. Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities? Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians. Noriega is a criminal.  Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country. If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments. What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say ""please"" or ""thank you."" Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion. Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.  Somehow, I don't see that happening. That's frustrating. As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some ""face time"". I don't know. It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired. Caroline?  How well did you know this boy who overdosed? Okay, honey.  We understand.  You're mother and I have to talk. I think she's lying.  We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing. Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that. This is different. To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old. Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct? How long have you known about this?  How long have you known? Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent. I appreciate you coming in so early. Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally. I don't know what you mean. I... I don't really know. No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.  It's Robert.  Wipe your schedule clean for the next three days.  I'm tired of talking to experts who never set foot outside the beltway.  It's time to see the front lines. Any idea how much? What do you look for? Any way we can do it better? That triple the amount of stuff is going through. Who are these guys? He died in a liposuction surgery, right? Who do we interface with on their side? I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side? I want everyone thinking out the box for a second.  What are we gonna do about Mexico?  Come on, guys.  Out of the box. Unlimited. Come on.  I want to hear from everyone: FBI.  Customs.  Treatment. Is there anyone from treatment on this plane?  Then I want an answer for why there isn't anyone from treatment.  Look, we know we have to bust one of these cartels, Juarez or Tijuana, not just as a symbol, but hell yes, also as a symbol - they are symbols - and there's nothing wrong with sending a message.  That's why when Carlos Ayala hired Michael Adler lead defense, I flew Ben Williams to San Diego to prosecute.  Because he's the best we have, he's our symbol that we're serious about putting the top people away.  So, as of right now, this flight only, consider the dam on new ideas thrown open. If I'm not mistaken, we got DEA, Pentagon, U.S. Attorneys office, about a billion dollars of budget right here.  So what are you people waiting for? I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to. Possibly. Barbara -- The first thing we have to do is present a unified front. Look, I'm as worried as you are -- Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too. I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different. Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.  Caroline.  Open this door immediately. You're not going anywhere, young lady. Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they? Fuck me?  Oh, okay.  Fuck me.  Fuck you. I'm going to ask you one time to tell me the truth so that I can help you. Okay, young lady, that's it. What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere. Oh, yes I can. I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels. You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel. Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem. Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?  Nobody saw her leave?  Yes... I understand. I have to go.  I have to go home. No, not yet. She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home. She hasn't called you? Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas? I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death. I don't give a fuck about your parents -- What? You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.  What do you mean, what do I want? I don't want anything. You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her. I'm looking for my daughter. About the other night, I'm sorry. God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen? Hello. No, it's all right. What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified. I'll get there as soon as I can.  I have to call you back. So's the video camera. She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour. Seth has to be excused.  He's going on a field trip. I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place. You're starting to piss me off.  Get out of the car. I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here. I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you. I have money -- I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet. Just tell me where she is.  How was she? The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso? So what's it doing in Tijuana? Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence? That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power? Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?  The War on Drugs is a war on our nation's most precious resource... our children.  Sixty-eight million children have been targeted by those who perpetrate this war and protecting those children must be priority number one.  There has been progress and there have been failures, but where we have fallen short I see not a problem but an opportunity. An opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past while laying a solid foundation for the future. (a long, uncomfortable beat) This takes not only new ideas, but perseverance.  This takes not only resources, but courage.  This takes not only government, but families. I've... I've outlined a ten-point plan, representing a new bilateral effort... I can't do this.  If there is a War on Drugs then our own families have become the enemy. How can you wage war on your own family? My name is Robert.  This is my wife, Barbara.  We're Caroline's parents. We're just hear to listen."
unforgiven,MUNNY ,Clint Eastwood,"  Huh? William Munny, yeah. What is it, son?  Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others.  Penny, you give yer brother a hand... Let's talk inside, mister. You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me... (he has the cups and he crosses to the fire) ...for somethin' I done in the old days. Yeah, I guess so. Maybe I ain't. He said that, huh? Schofield?  You from Schofield? Oh. About what? What for?  Jesus!  No cussin' now, Will.   Go on out the pump an' clean up some an' I'll be along.   Check them other pens. I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness. She's passed on, Kid. Been gone near three years now. I don't never see nobody anyhow.  Best we move that pig. Them flowers, Penny, I could tell your Maw liked them, hear?  Take care of your sister, son. You can kill three chickens if you need, not no more.  Keep the hogs that got fever separate if you can.  An' if you need help, go see Sally Two- Trees over to Ned Logan's.  Ain't felt a saddle in a while myself. Easy old gal, easy... Now this here horse is gettin' even on me... hold on gal... for the sins of my youth... In my youth... before I met... your dear departed mother... I was weak an' givin' to mistreatin' horses an' such.  An' this here horse... an' that ole pig, too, I guess... is my comeuppance for my cruelty... Used to be I could cuss an' hurt an animal... til your departed mother, God rest her, showed me the error of my ways.  I won't be no longer than a couple of weeks.  Remember how the spirit of your departed maw watches over you.  Hullo Sally... I... uh, I ain't seen you in near as long as this, uh... as this horse ain't felt the saddle.  Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first. Eleven.  We done stuff before for money, Ned. Cut up a woman.  Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.  I guess you wouldn't mind to look in on my youngsters next week. Might be you could help them move a couple of them pigs if they got to separate 'em more. Two weeks, I guess. Yup.  You still got the Spencer rifle? We'll come across him tomorra, I guess. Got used to my bed.  Ain't gonna feel to home out here. It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me. She gave me the evil eye. I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.  I ain't the same, Ned.  Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all.  Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head?  I dream about him now an' again.  I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up. Nobody liked me... none of the boys.  They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness. Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none. Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared. Hell, no.  I'm just a fella now. ain't no different from anyone else no more. No you didn't.  You wasn't no different, Ned.  Sure, I got to.  Got to get supplies. Naw.  Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all.  I don't miss it all that much.  Yeah. Yeah. Naw.  I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse. Beats the hell out of me. I didn't see nothin' planted.  HEY.  HEY, KID. IS THAT YOU, KID? HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY. Had to chase the damn horse a mile. Well, we was.  Like you said, I changed my mind an'...  Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe... Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle.  Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'. Three ways, I figured.  Sorry, Ned.  Guess I wasted your time.  See ya, Kid!  He's my partner.  He don't go, I don't. Oh shit.  Huh? Lookin' at?  Shit. Now hold on, boys, hold on.  Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you? Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned?  The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear? Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.  Yeah... you said that last night. Well, I guess you're gonna miss your fuckin' roof soon enough. What business?  Well... I don't recollect. Get some sleep, Kid. You fucking no-good goddamn shit- faced pig fucking dirty whore. I didn't mean it, old gal. Not for me.  I don't touch it no more. I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?  No. Yeah?  Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned.  I ain't no crazy, killin' fool. If we don't drown first. You... you remember Eagle Hendershot? I seen him. His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.  Worms was comin' out.  Huh? Uh, no.  No, I ain't drunk.  Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms. I... dunno.  I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns. Like I said, I... Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.  I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed. Uh... yeah.  Yeah. Well, uh... it ain't loaded. Well, the powder's wet an... Ohhhhh, ooohhhh no.  No, I didn't do nothin'.  Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death. I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes. The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned.  Ned, I'm gonna die. I seen her... I seen Claudia too... She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'... Ned... don't tell nobody... don't tell the kids... don't tell 'em none of... none of the things I done. I thought... you was an angel. Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh? I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ? Scouting? Oh.  How long I been here? Three days?  I must be. I thought I was gone.  See them birds?  Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much.  But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead. That big guy lookin' for me?  Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there? Advances?  Free ones?  Oh.  Yeah.  Me?  No.  No, I guess not. I... I guess not. (unusually perceptive suddenly) I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up.  I didn't mean that.  It ain't that at all.  You're a beautiful woman.  What I said before, how I might look like you ... I didn't mean you was ugly like me, hell no... I only meant how we both had scars. You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others.  It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife... Yeah.  See?  Yeah, I guess. Uh... yeah.  Yeah.  She's uh... watchin' over the little ones. Finish him, Ned.  He got the boy's horse. He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.  If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there. I ain't much of a shot. Shit! How many shots I got, Ned?  HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT? Better re-load it. I got him.  Maybe, maybe not.  Got him in the gut, I think.  Yup... we killed him, I guess.  BRING HIM SOME GODDAMN WATER, YOU ASSHOLES.  WILL YOU TAKE HIM A FUCKING DRINK FOR CHRIST SAKE!  WE AIN'T GONNA SHOOT. No. Yeah. After a ways. We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.  Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit. Shut up, Kid.  HOLD ON, NED. I ain't worth a shit with it. Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him.  Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together. I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range.  Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.  Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money.  I'll bring your share along, hear?  The Kid's full of shit, hear? It's gonna get riper yet.  Yeah, he's in there. He's in there. Yup.  You can shoot him.  Yup.  He's yours, Kid.  Can you get him? SHOOT HIM, KID! Come on, Kid. Did... you... get... him? Hold still. Cover me, Kid, while I mount. Just SHOOT!  Yeah, I guess so. I don't remember, Kid.  I was drunk most of the time.  Give me a pull on that bottle, will you? Yeah. First one what?  Yeah? Well, that fella today, you shot him alright. Take a drink, Kid. It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man.  You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have... We all got it comin', Kid. I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.  You wanna help me count, Kid? Well, you don't wanna trust me too much.  We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.  Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...  No he ain't.  He went South yesterday.  Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday.  He didn't even kill nobody.  Why would anybody kill Ned?  Who killed him? He hanged him? (Little Sue shakes her head ""no"") Shot him down?  Good example!  Good example of what I'd like to know?  He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.  A sign on him?  They got a sign on him in front of Greely's? The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they? What'd Ned say? Then... what? An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done? Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it? Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.  Lemmee see it.  You better get on back, Miss. I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all. Shit, Kid.  I ain't gonna kill you.  You're... the only friend I got.  This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters.  Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week.  The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.  I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle. Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you.  Go on now, skedaddle.  Which fucker owns this shithole?  You there, fat man, speak up.  Better step clear, boys.  He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.  I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys. Every asshole that doesn't want to get shot best clear out the back quick. You ain't shot.  You sure you ain't armed? A writer?  What do you write... letters an' such?  Yeah. Huh?  Yeah? I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.  I could tell you who was last, mister. Missed again, asshole.  ""Deserve"" don't mean shit, Little Bill. I'm comin' outta here... an' any fucker I see out there, I'm gonna kill him... an' any fucker takes a shot at me, I ain't just gonna kill him, but I'm gonna kill his wife an' all his friends an' burn his fucking house, hear? You boys better bury old Ned right... and you better not carve up nor otherwise harm no whores... or I will come back an' kill more sonsabitches, hear?  Ain't you a lady! Place looks good. I guess you lost some hogs to the fever. Three?  That ain't bad considerin'.  Tom? The Kid, yeah...  He say anythin'... The Kid... ?  Well, I come back, didn't I?  Did I what?  Steal it?  Naw, I didn't steal it.  What? Who said that?  Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all.  Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.  Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody."
insidious,JOSH ,Patrick Wilson,"  Every time I think I've pulled you out...you grow back in. Ouch!  Don't eat on the floor, buddy.  How come you were up so early? Was Cali crying? What do you mean? No I wasn't. I don't snore. My father snored. I do not snore. Good one, champ.  I don't snore, do I? What the heck is this? Wax?! Let me get this straight - we have no actual fruit but we have wax fruit? That is dangerous. It could kill one of our kids. Probably where you left them, Renai. See. Check it first, Dalton. It's probably made out of Styrofoam. I gotta go. No time. Not today. Alanso, please sit down. Sintate, por favor. Come on guys, quieten down. Thank you, Teri. Today we are going to talk about Darwin. It's a city in Australia, but it's also the last name of which famous naturalist? Correct. Does anybody know what he is famous for? Half right. He wrote a seminal book that explained his theories on natural selection, and how the different species on this planet - including humans - evolved. Humans actually have a lot in common with monkeys, or more specifically, chimpanzees. I respect your right to believe that, Alanso. But I want to give you all possible theories. I want this class to go out into the world with an informed opinion. How can it be incorrect? It's a theory. A scientific theory. Alanso, if you keep talking like that I'm going to ask you to visit the principal. Look at this. Nice job. Whoa, buddy. Slow down. I don't know. They should be here. We packed them up. I remember the movers bringing them in and putting them right there. What happened? Where do you hurt the most? You scared us, champ. You're lucky you don't need stitches. We've gotta lock that door. Why bother with a child leash? I'll stop at the pet store tomorrow. I didn't even notice. It's normal to want your own time. You're a great mother. That's not true. Now you're being crazy. They love you. At least you get to connect with them. I work so much. Is this so bad? We'll get by. I want you to do it. I love all your songs. Time to get up, my man. Come on. You're making me look bad here. Outta bed before your mother comes in and kills both of us. Dalton, get up. You've gotta get ready for school. Dalton...? Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!! So...there's no brain damage or...? That fall he took...I mean, it looked like he hit his head pretty hard. So what do we do now? Does he stay here? She said dad... What? Could it have been interference? Who the hell is that? Stay here. Hello? Who's there? What did you say?  Grab Cali and Foster! Uh...what? Just take it without me. No, you don't. Just take the damn photo without me, okay? What? Thank you, Alanso. I wish I had your belief. Things would be a lot simpler.  Hey...I just found out I have to stay back tonight and finish off mid-term grades. It could be a while, there's a lot to go through. Don't wait up. Bye. The men all walked down to the waters edge...and they stood there and asked the beast to come forth. And the beast roared back ""No!"". And so they dived in after it... What are you doing up? When did you start smoking? I don't like it either, but I'm grading tests. What choice do I have? We've gotta pay Dalton's bills. Jesus, I can't win with you. That's my son in there too, not just yours! I've always felt like less than good enough for you. I feel it every time you mention our bills. That subtle voice that says `can't you get a job that pays more than a teacher'? And now I can't even look at you without feeling it. I don't need to ask. I know you. I told you, I'm grading tests. Christ, I should have stayed at the school. What is it? What is it?! Renai, what is wrong?! There's no one here. There's no one here. I believe you, okay? I just don't know what you want me to do. You're okay, buddy. I've got you. To move now would be...we would have to rent somewhere. It's not-- So...if you're the top of the food chain with this stuff, where does that leave us? Sorry to scare you. Where did all the bartenders who listen to your troubles go, Ned? I don't need whisky for that. I probably would too.  It's funny, I've always known I was the type of person that things didn't happen to. I made peace with it. I thought to myself, it's okay - I'll never win the lottery or climb Mount Everest...but I'll never get a rare tropical blood disease either. It works out.  Now I'm the guy whose son is in a mysterious coma. This is the first line of a joke. Guy comes home to find his wife with a priest... Can't say I've heard the same, Liam. At least I know you're not sleeping with her. What is going on here? Okay, would anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on here? ""Joshua?"" Oh Jesus... The melodramatic way in which you two are conducting yourselves right now is scaring the shit out of me, so just tell me what's wrong. Nobody asks you to sit down unless something is wrong. If a doctor calls you into his office and asks you to sit down, you're fucked. I have not been drinking. Not enough that we can't talk to each other, Renai. And don't judge me in that bitchy tone, okay? Christ. You're acting like I'm some lush who comes home and beats you with a belt. At least I'm speaking to you. You suddenly have to speak to a priest. Or my mother who, up until a couple of weeks ago, you couldn't stand. So...what? You called in a priest to get rid of it? Are you kidding me?  Was this your idea? You've never been to a church in your life. Now you're inviting a priest into our home? I feel like I don't even know you right now. This is a fantasy, and you need a therapist, not a member of the clergy. What is it? I don't know how. Yeah. Oh. This is a little uncomfortable. Speaking for myself. I'm not used to this kind of stuff. No.  I'm sorry, I have to ask how this relates to our problem? What is that? Mrs. Rainier? Last saw me? Go ahead. No. No. This has gone too far. I have given her a chance, and I did that because I wanted to help you. But I cannot have somebody telling us that the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul is floating off somewhere in another dimension. No, it's not fair is what it is. You're preying on people's grief and vulnerability, which is really easy to do in a situation like this. Because I wanted to help you. To put your mind at ease, and if this helped, then great. But to drag Dalton into this? No. Fair? How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here? Don't you see? You want to believe. Of course you do, honey, anybody would. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do. I really do. But I think it's dangerous to start throwing out false hope like this. I have to put my foot down. My wife is not...mentally well at the moment, and I have to keep at least one of her feet here in the real world. Honey, I'm on your side. But I genuinely think this is dangerous and frankly, a little exploitative. You come into a home with a seriously ill child, you make a tenuous connection between him and these experiences Renai is having and viola - the client starts crying because they're desperate to believe, the tears validate your power, thank you, that'll be six hundred dollars please. I know, I know...look, I appreciate your interest and your time. I do. Thank you. Thank you very much. Look at me for a second, honey.  Look at me. Did you really believe what she said? In your heart of hearts, did you actually take what she was saying literally? Do you think I don't want to believe in that stuff? Of course I do. It would make life a lot easier if I did. If I believed that some supernatural force was responsible for what's happened to our son... Where are you? Where did you go?  Can you hear me? I'm begging you to show me that you can hear me...I don't know how to help you. Please tell me what to do. Please God, please help me...give me my son back. I will do anything just to have him back. I need him back. I need him to show me that he can hear me. Please... Okay. Mom...what are you doing here? Why? Tell me what? What are you talking about? No...I've never...done that before. I don't...I don't remember any of this... Who is she? How long do we have before...that thing...takes him over completely? I love you too. I have since the first time you looked at me. I don't exist without you. This is useless...I have no idea what I'm doing and you just suddenly expect me to... Dalton? Dalton? Where are you? Dalton? Dalton? Where is Dalton? Do you know where Dalton is? Dalton? Where are you? I'm looking for my son, Dalton. DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!! DALTON! DALTON!! Get...off..me! Get away from me! Leave now! Dalton!! Dalton! Dalton...? I'm taking you back. What is it? You're not really here. You're asleep in your bed in our home. Just stand up. This isn't real. You can do this. Just stand up!  ....ome....onnnnn... I want to get out! ....eeeeet out! Go! I'm right behind you! You...what do you want from me? Get the fuck away from me! I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me! Dalton...? Now this is worth dying for. You introduced me to a new world. Maybe I can forget again. I'll start by giving these back. What's wrong? What's the matter, Elise? Why the fuck would you do that? Why would you do that? Why?! You of all people! You know! Why would you do that to me when you know what you know? You bitch! You introduced me to a new world. Maybe I can forget again. I'll start by giving these back. What's wrong? What's the matter, Elise? Go! I'm right behind you! You...what do you want from me? Get away the fuck away from me. I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me!"
se7en,SOMERSET ,Morgan Freeman," No... no.  There's nothing wrong. Soon. Everything here still seems... seems so strange to me.  All this. That is exactly what I mean.  Strange. Did his wife confess?  Did she actually speak the words? Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here. Did their son see it happen? I heard you brought in two small-timers last night. Since we are just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and talk for awhile.  That way we can... I meant to ask you something... when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering...  Why are you here? All this effort you've gone through, to be transferred from Philadelphia to here.  It's the first question that pops into my head. You think you know me?  You just met me two minutes ago. It's very simple.  You've come from the ""City of Brotherly Love"" to the ""City of Brotherly Hate,"" detective.  I've never seen it done that way. Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I want you to listen. But, you've never worked homicide in this city. Well, please do me the favor of remembering it. At what time did you confirm the death? Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you again after we've had a look. I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into? Drop it.  We have more important concerns just now, don't we?  Not yet. If you could... spare me the anecdotes for now.  Leave the refrigerator open for the light. What do you smell?  Other than him, and all the food. A bucket. Is there any blood in it? Guessing this early is useless. Well, three is certainly a crowd in here.  And, with four, someone's bound to be stepping on evidence.  Detective Mills, go help the officers question the neighbors.  Send one forensic in on your way out. Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills. No. Yes.  Impressive work. I know it.  That doesn't mean... I made a decision, because I have to worry about the integrity of the scene. When I'm on scene, I'm not going to worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.  I'm there to do the work. You've worked Homicide for four years, or for five years... Don't count the half-years, unless you want to sound like a rookie. Doctor, are you saying this man... ate till he burst? Those bruises on the back of the victim's head were caused by the muzzle of a gun. He was force-fed... till his body started rejecting the food.  He literally couldn't eat another bite. His throat was swollen from the effort. He was bleeding internally. He must have blacked out... and, if you're the killer, you're not going to want to wait around for him to die. Same color and texture. Always look for one thing to focus on. There's always one singular thing, and it might be as small as a speck of dust, but find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility. Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be inside his stomach unless they were placed there intentionally? Milton. It's a quote from a book.  Milton's Paradise Lost.  ""One pound of flesh, no more no less. No cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. This task done, and he would go free."" This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down nude, holding a carving knife.  And he was given a long time... to decide. Where to make the first cut?  There's a gun to your head... but, what part or parts of your body are expendable? Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at once, his love handle.  But, he went into shock.  Bled to death. Look at both killings together.  This murderer is an artist. He uses colors and symbols.  He positions the bodies after death, so he's working with composition.  It's been premeditated so meticulously... and this is just the beginning. The rats and the pennies.  The circle and the triangle on the wall.  There's something about them... these murders mean something. I need you to know... I want us reassigned.  We're declining this case. This cannot be my last duty here.  It's going to go on and on. Everything else was taken as close to a conclusion as humanly possible. Also... I don't think this should be Mills' first case. It would be too much for him, too soon. I'll get a job.  Maybe on a farm.  I'll fix up my house.  I don't know what you mean. Did you read in the paper today, about the man who took his dog for a walk? And how he was mugged?  And, his wallet was taken, and his watch.  Then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened last night.  Not far from here. I have no understanding of this place. Yes.  You're absolutely right.  Put a little elbow grease into it! Sorry.  Last one. How is she?  Have you seen her recently? Good for her.  I'm leaving soon myself.  I'm finally getting out. He became a realist.  Not that I don't appreciate your recent artistic endeavors... but, what happened to the painter I used to know? They're not for sale. What is it?  What's the murderer trying to say? What picture is he painting? Where? The seven deadly sins. Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth. Seven deadly sins. And, it's two down... five to go. Uh... I was looking for Mills.  David, I mean. Mrs. Mills, my name is Somerset.  If I could leave these books for him. Thank you. Could you tell him... tell him this is his reading assignment.  It's urgent. I've marked the most important pages. I do have to get going. Really?  Good things, I hope. Really? I'm going to leave him a list of specifics.  It all relates to the case he's on. To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Mills... Tracy.  David and I weren't exactly what you could call fast friends. I doubt your husband shares that opinion. He's a good cop.  He just... I hear you and he were high school sweethearts. It's rare these days... that kind of commitment. Well... this will only take a minute. My future.  Well!  I guess I won't be showing this to him then. How's it coming? It's your name on the door.  Hello?  Yes, well... I appreciate the thought, but... I...  Well, I guess I'd be delighted to. Thank you... goodbye. I'm invited to have a late supper with you and your wife.  And I accept.  Tonight. I was close.  It just didn't happen. Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable.  Just ask your husband. Too long.  Much too long.  What do you think of our fair city?  You'll get used to it pretty quickly. There are things in any big city that stand out at first.  But... I'm sorry... it's a nice apartment. All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day. What about them? I read.  Remember reading?  What's the last book you read, Mills? I vaguely recall Wilma, and someone named... Dino. No connection between the two victims? No witnesses of any kind? In this city, minding your own business is a perfected science. At the precinct, Sunday nights, they offer a public crime prevention course. And, the very first thing they teach is that you should never scream ""help"" if you're in trouble.  Scream ""fire."" Because people don't want to get caught up in anything.  But, a fire... that's entertainment.  They come running. ""The Sun in Splendor with the Eye.""  It refers to God the father, and to Saint Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas wrote a summary of theology, Summa Theologica.  And he wrote about the seven deadly sins. Now, what else have you got? So... satisfying my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town on Sunday. This is his wife? And, if it's a threat? This is the one thing. It's like he's preaching.  The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, as a learning tool.  The sins distract man from true worship.  True faith. Seven Terraces of Purgation. Because there's creativity in the mix. Consider these books as the murderer's inspiration.  Or aspiration. He sees himself contributing to the body of Christian work. For all of us to see and learn from. These murders are like forced attrition. Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God. When Mr. Gold's wife found the body, about how long was she in the apartment? I thought you said she found the body. When she got back from a business trip. Maybe she is supposed to see something... she just hasn't had a chance to see it yet. He sees himself contributing to the body of Christian work. For all of us to see and learn from. These murders are like forced attrition. Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God. When Mr. Gold's wife found the body, about how long was she in the apartment? I thought you said she found the body. When she got back from a business trip. Maybe she is supposed to see something... she just hasn't had a chance to see it yet. Have her look one last time. This has got to be it. It has to be.  He changed the wire to rehang it. Bear with me. Shut up and wait! Call the print lab.  Now. No.  I have not. It doesn't work for me.  I can't believe he wants us to help him stop. You really meant what you said to Mrs. Gold.  You really believe we'll get him, don't you? I wish I still thought like you.  I'm so far gone from that. All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence... all the pictures, statements.  Write everything down and note what time things happened. We take it all, make a nice, neat pile and file it away.  Just in case it's ever needed in a courtroom. I've seen even the most promising clues lead to dead ends.  Hundreds of times. In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if every un- revenged corpse were to suddenly rise and walk again, there would be no more room for the living. Does not seem like our killer, does it? Zero does possess the requisite degree of insanity... but, he doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Zero could ever conceive of. Why would we? No.  Never in twenty-four years.  I took my gun out only five times with the actual intention of using it.  I never fired it.  Not once. And? How did the fire-fight end? How was it? I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that, in order to live in a city, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, to survive. Sloth... it's sloth. Someone call an ambulance.  The first photo... it's dated one year ago.  Almost to the day. The way this has gone, I didn't think it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints. Listen... we have to divorce ourselves from our emotions here.  We have to keep focusing on the small details. He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful. Are you listening to me?! They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.  You can hate them, but you better give them something, or they'll make it all up. Oh, it's alright.  It's always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions. I needed for you to see them. If this killer belongs to a certain branch of the church... if he collects religious art from a certain period, I want to know.  I have to narrow it down. In the murders, gluttony is green. Greed is yellow.  Sloth is indigo. Where do I look?  If the colors changed so often? Problems? Father? Tell me what happened. What abuse? Father Stone.  I'm a policeman.  I'd like to ask you a few questions, if it's alright? I want to ask you about the seven deadly sins. Yes, father. I don't... I... I need to ask about the sins.  Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm just looking. Is this still the Lord's house? And, even if Father Stone was guilty of everything... if he was hurting children here?  It's still the Lord's house? No.  That's not what I've given up on. So, what is this? Dario!  Come here. According to the Father, this orphanage wasn't around for more than five or six years in the late fifties.  So, I want someone to go to the Department of Child Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the records on this place.  Understand? Get a list of every child who attended this orphanage before it shut down.  Get it on my desk within the hour. You thought of this all by yourself? This was your brainstorm? It's a pleasant surprise.  I guess not. No... I don't see any Ramirez. No. No. That's not what you think it is. That's right.  Let me have it. How do you know? Christ... it's like a sick joke. There is one boy here.  He was abandoned... no one knew who his parents were, so he was named at the orphanage...  John Doe.  It's his legal name. We're focusing. We'll look at him.  Ask a few questions. Try to get a feeling whether we should keep tabs on him. Yeah.  I think so. Jesus Christ. I know. We need to put more men on this. We've got about five thousand notebooks in this room.  And, as near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages. ""What sick, silly puppets we are, and what a gross stage we dance on.  What fun we have, dancing around, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what God intended.""  ""On the subway today, a man came up to start a conversation.  He was making small talk, this lonely man, talking about the weather and other things.  I tried to be accommodating, but my head began to hurt from his banality.  I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I threw up all over him.  And I couldn't stop myself from laughing.""  No dates indicated.  They're placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  He describes a scab on his arm for five pages, then writes about existential philosophy on the next. It's just his mind poured out on paper. You can see what he did. She had the telephone. Or, kick out the chair, and spare yourself a lifetime of hideousness. Tracy? I'm alright.  I'm glad to see you found this place.  I almost should have expected to run into you here, knowing that you teach English. This is why I moved into this neighborhood. Same here. You can stay and browse a little longer, can't you?  I mean... I... I hardly know anyone I can talk about books with anymore.  I'd appreciate the company. The irony is, that after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  Murders in the Rue Morgue. My mother would give him hell... because I was young, and he was keeping me up till all hours, giving me nightmares. One birthday, he gave me a hardcover book called The Century of the Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of detection as a science and it sealed my fate.  Because it was real, and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... was incredible to me. Okay, thanks. I'll give you a ride. I have to insist.  If your husband found out I let you ride the subway at this hour he'd tear my head off. I mean, literally. It's a hard place, Tracy. You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.  But, keep in mind, Tracy, like tonight, there are small pockets of sanity.  Some bars and bookstores. Museums.  Several last vestiges of civilization. You can always look into the private schools.  You'll find something. You're too hard on yourself, Tracy. It's okay to hate this city.  It's natural.  But, there is a bright side in all this.  There is.  You want to hear it? I can't think of another place that needs education more than this city. And you're a teacher.  You can make a difference in a few people's lives. It's a very good thing. Goodnight. I'm sorry, Tracy.  I'm sorry. Nothing.  Sorry. Apples on the floor.  Original sin. Lust is everywhere.  That's the hard part.  I think lust is the most prevalent sin, even more than greed. Bright red. Red sky at night, sailor's delight. Red light district. It would be fitting. What was this job you did for him?  You built this for him?  You built this? Where was the girl? Where was the prostitute? Who tied her down?  You or him? There's not going to be a happy ending. It's not possible. No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against the bad guys in this city. You tell me... when you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or, a wife murdered her husband in cold blood... and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won? Where's the victory? If we caught John Doe tomorrow, and it turned out he was the devil... if it turned out he was literally Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations. No human being could do these horrible things, right?!  But, this is not the devil.  It's only a man. Who are you fighting for?  People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers. There's no one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live anymore where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue. Wrong!  I sympathize completely. Because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you go insane.  It's easier to smoke crack, and not worry that your wife and kids are starving to death. And, it's so much easier to bear a child till that child finally shuts up, because it takes so much work to love. And, if you bothered to think about the abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad.  No, I am not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  Where Ignorance isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival.  People who are in arguments over their heads always use meaningless slogans. But, life doesn't conform to analogies. That part of me is dead.  Hello. Is everything alright?  I don't think that's a good idea. David doesn't know about this?  You haven't told him? I have to tell you, Tracy, I'm not the one to talk to about this. I... I had a relationship once, very much like a marriage.  And, there was a baby.  A long time ago.  Things were good.  And I got up one morning, and I went on a case... a murder, like any other.  Except it was my first since hearing about the baby.  And, I felt this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I looked around and I thought, how can I raise a child here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have children,  And, over the next few weeks... I convinced her... I mean, I wore her down... slowly. I can tell you, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive it was the right thing to do.  But, there's never a day that goes by that I don't wish I had decided differently. If you... if you decide not to have the baby... if that's what you decide, then never tell Mills you were pregnant. I mean that.  Never tell.  Your marriage would just wither, and die altogether. But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.  Tell him that exact second.  And, spoil that kid every chance you get. That's all the wisdom I can share with you, Tracy.  I barely know you. Probably not.  But, it's probably better that way. I've decided... I want to stay on, till this is over.  Till either it's done, or we can see it will never end. One of two things is going to happen. We're either going to get John Doe... or, he will finish his series of seven, and he'll never be found. I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor. No.  I wasn't sure at all. As soon as this is over, I'll be gone. Be careful! I don't believe it. Because he is John Doe, by choice. Slow up.  You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop. John Doe's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  But, can you even conceive of what might happen next?  I mean, can you tell me how he's going to go about it? I can tell you this; I recognize his lawyer.  His name is Mark Swarr.  He's the one who kept Zero out of prison.  We'll wait for John Doe's plea.  This is all part of his game plan. Hold on... just a minute. If he were to plead insanity... this conversation is admissible.  The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea...  Well... let's get the fucking lawyer out of the room, and we can talk about how this whole thing's going to go down. If John Doe's head splits open, and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it. No emotion.  Stay as cold as ice. What is it? Please... Give me a break. Ready? I'm here. If we're on the bridge, you keep your distance.  You hear me?  Cross the river before us if necessary.  A quick sweep is all we get.  Clear out now.  You're right in front of us.  You stay out of this unless I call you in, California.  Understand? Mills! Christ. Mills!  Pull out!  Pull out now! Where's David? Tell me what you want. I want to see him.  Show me Mills. You're a murderer.  That's all.  The only way you've distinguished yourself is by your particular brutality. You're killing innocent people, and I should admire you?  You're doing it because it gives you pleasure.  That's the only purpose... your sick pleasure. All you've done is cause more misery and pain!  You've given people all the more reason to believe there is no God! Do you really think I'm just going to let this happen?!  You think I'm going to let him die?  Let him go, God damn you. Alright... you don't have to do this, John.  You've already made your point. You're insane.  That's why. Don't do this! No! David, get out! No! David... David?  Please... You. I wish I could say something...  Something to... I don't know... We'll keep in touch.  I'll come visit. Take care of yourself.  Take care of the baby. Goodbye, Tracy.  Oh... man..."
domino,DOMINO ,Keira Knightley," My name is Domino Harvey.  I am... a bounty hunter. They're watching me from behind that two way mirror. What I say over the next several hours will determine whether or not I spend the rest of my life in prison. Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.' Sure... I'll tell you everything I know. I don't know. You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror. Yes. He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch. EDNA! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE! That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it. Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch! The next one is going to doggie hell! That's Ed Martin. The most legendary bounty hunter in all of Los Angeles. He's my boss. My mentor. The father I never had. The Manchurian Candidate, huh Edna? Nice to see you again, Edna. Listen bitch! We've got your son! If you don't deliver the money... we're gonna wax his fucking ass! I can certainly think of one more! HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA! That's our driver. He's from Afghanistan. He once ate a cat.  We can't understand how to pronounce his fucking name so we just call him Alf. The cat-eating alien. He had the combination to the safe tattooed on his arm. Turn over your weapon, Edna! Not so fast! I'm coming with you. Is that the decoder? I've never killed anyone. I hope to never kill anyone. Even if they deserve it. My agenda is to kick ass and secure the bounty. If I'm on this side of the law... I can live the low life and avoid jail. I can live the nasty and not do time for it.  That's called the best of both worlds. As for that other world... that 90210 world... it's not for me. My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl. You're probably wondering how a girl like me arrived here at the ass end of the Nevada desert with a blood-spattered Winnebago and a one-armed man. To do that... I'll have to start at the beginning. After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash. My mischief was cramping mum's husband hunting. She decided to sock me and my goldfish Sammy away in boarding school. A week later Sammy died. It was a pivotal moment in my life. It was then that I realized God designed us all to perish. I decided to never invest too much emotion in one thing. It's always a set up to the pain of losing them. God created me in his image.  I guess he had a thing for models. I started on the runways in England. Like most models, I was bored with life. I hated everything... and everyone. If you think America is dirtbag central... clearly you've never been to the sleaze-nation of our Queen mother. Mum was determined to move us to Beverly Hills. That damn show started it all. She re-married to a man named Marc Osborne. He invested in a restaurant called Planet Hollywood. We were never that close. I tried Beverly Hills High for a spell... but it didn't work out. I hated them. I hated them all. College was even worse. Mum convinced me to joined a sorority. It was all fun and games at first. Then the hazing started. Did you get a nose job? Everything. It is a ghastly existence. The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode. I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me. Cunt. Cunt. Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation? A week later I was expelled. In the end... it all came down to fate. An LA Weekly advert strewn across a desolate beach. Claremont Williams III. The legendary bail bondsman. A few months later we met face to face. Yes... I'm here for the bounty hunter seminar. Keep the change. Fuck you, douche-bag. If you hang out with Ed long enough, he'll tell you about Danang. He'll tell you about the North Vietnamese tunnel he found and the battle that ensued. This man is a warrior. That day in Danang made him one. Motherfucker. To say that Choco is a product of a broken home is to presume a home existed in the first place. No, Choco never had a home. Not unless you count the ten or so juvenile correction facilities where he spent his childhood. What the fuck is this shit? Where the fuck do you think you're going? These people paid good money for a seminar! I don't want my fucking money back... I want a job.  You take me on as part of your team... or else. I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die. Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun. You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino. No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay? For two-hundred dollars... Tina gave us her son's whereabouts. A local Gang-banger hideout up the street. I could feel the blood coursing through my veins. Shotgun in hand, kicking down a door and wondering if there was heavy fire power on the other side. Turns out... my first raid was to be a near disaster. That bitch Tina set us up. The oreo cookie was hiding underneath her bed all along. That night... my coin was tossed. Heads you live... tails you die. Fifty-fifty chance. Life or death. My destiny was life. Life as a bounty hunter. This ain't Sunset Boulevard. We're not cops. We're bounty hunters. All we want is Cookie. You tell us where he is... and I'll... Sometimes a girl has to be naughty in order to get herself out of a jam. I'll give you a lap dance. Bra and panties on. You or your friends touch me... I'll cut your balls off. It worked. We got the scoop on how to find Cookie. Two weeks later we nailed him. From that day on... Eddie, Choco and I... we were inseparable. Why are we going to the DMV? After six months... Claremont hired Alf to drive us around... we were so busy. Sometimes we went as far east as Texas. When there's cash on the table... the line between law enforcer and criminal becomes rather blurry. Sometimes we'd accept seized narcotics for a payment instead of cash. The street re-sale value let us triple our payday. Little did I know that the FBI liked to keep tabs on us bounty hunters. So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter? Really? Did you play in a band? I... love... Pat Benatar. Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?! How did you meet Choco? We may have been dysfunctional, but we worked. We were family. Put... the gun... down. In 2003 I was named Bounty Hunter. of the year. Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit. It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter. He used to date Pat Benatar! Morning. He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss. Mark Weiss was friends with Mum. He heard my story at some cocktail party. Turns out he wanted to put us on television. Mum was horrified at the idea and demanded to tag along just to keep me from signing anything. I felt like a hypocrite, given my hatred of all things Hollywood. But I'll admit... I wanted my story told. I wanted everyone to know the things I'd done. I wanted some recognition in the world. We'll do it. It was the beginning of the end. On Wednesday morning, Kimmie took us to buy a new winnebago for Alf to drive. Fox wasn't too keen on the Impala. They wanted something that could house a camera crew. We aren't going on vacation. Fucking 90210. I couldn't get away from it. It wasn't until later on that I realized mum had gotten to Weiss and pulled some strings. Alf grew up during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. He had always wanted to be part of the revolution... but it seemed to pass him by. At the tender age of seventeen he decided that explosives would be his specialty. His eyebrows never grew back. No notes. This is our Winnebago. It stays like this... or I walk. Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.  There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul. Lateesha was one of Claremont's many mistresses. Lateesha was our prime contact at the DMV. Most of our bond certificates came from Claremont through her. Save it, Kee Kee. Where's Lateesha? We need to ID some bond certificates. That's the rumor on the street. We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. Her car was in the shop. It just kept getting worse for Lateesha. No one could have expected what happened next. Their names were Cosgrove and Espinoza. Someone had tipped them off to Lateesha's counterfeit scam. But that's not what they were really after. This was the moment that Lateesha decided to do something very foolish. There are three kinds of people in the world. The rich... the poor... and everyone in between. The rich people hate the poor... because they are always stealing from them. That's Drake Bishop. owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino. He's worth a billion dollars. Ten million of it recently stolen. His attorney... Burke Beckett. Crime boss Anthony Cigliuti. Bishop's attorney had put his boss in business with the mob. Quite a mess indeed. Beckett had just brokered an underhanded deal with Cigliuti for a few hundred acres of desert land to build a golf resort. The ten million en route from LA to Vegas belonged to the mob. The FBI was always listening. Hence the underwater cordless. Cigliuti had just purchased a hundred prototypes from Japan. Most of his conversations now took place underwater. Locus Fender was brought in to drive the armored car. Another one of Claremont's network of stooges. His mother Edna worked at the Needles DMV. According to Locus... they stopped for gas... He was sure they'd nabbed the cash. Straight up double cross. But they left without it. Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses. I was asleep in mum's guest house. Hello? I want it to be documented. So when I am an old hag I can look back at my life and say that I once kicked some wicked ass. Quit acting macho for the camera, douche-bag. Are you wearing make-up? You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen. Who the hell is that? What the fuck is this? We've already met you. Claremont fed us a fake story about the First Ladies. Apparently they call themselves the First Ladies. Jackie Onassis. His real name was Lester Kincaid. Lester Kincaid... you're going to jail. Nancy Reagan turned out to be a sex-addict named Carl Stein. CARL STEIN. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton were next. We found them at their Frat House. You're just making yourself look like a bigger loser by yelling. Fine. As long as they stay out of our way.  It's a fucking frat house. Why not?  Take it easy. There's no need to get too rough with these kids. We're looking for Frances and Charles. Are they here? We're with a new reality show. It's called Bounty Hunters. Well... if we catch the right guy we get to keep 10% of is bail and he gets to go to jail. Frances... where is Frances? Who wants to be on Bounty Hunters? You can all be famous if you cooperate! You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances? Cuff 'em boys. You're under arrest. Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four. What? What makes you so sure? Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies? What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them? Something is going down. Something bad. You know why there aren't bond certificates? Because these guys have never been arrested. This is a private job. I'm telling you that Lateesha and Claremont are setting us up. Turn off the camera. This whole situation is fucked. I sure as hell hope you know what you're doing. Something awful was about to happen. I could feel it in my bones. What is it, Choco? Mind if I ask you a question?  Do I look like I speak Spanish? Do I look Mexican to you? ENGLISH! SPEAK IN ENGLISH! ED IS RIGHT, IT'S NOT CUTE! IT'S NEVER BEEN CUTE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU! Who are you? Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done. On Earth as it is in Heaven. Forgive us oh Lord for our daily trespasses... for we know not what we do. And what we see... may not be the truth. What happened to them? Jesus Christ! Anthony Cigliuti?! You set me up to deliver the children of a mafia crime boss to be executed? Do you know how fucked we are?!!  You've started a war, Claremont! And you've killed four innocent people! What are we supposed to do now? Claremont laid it all out on the table. His plan was to ask for a $300,000 finders fee to recover the ten million he'd stolen. The whole thing became a huge cluster fuck when Lateesha tried to pin it on the Cigliuti kids. Now our only chance for survival was to stay on course and retrieve the money.  First priority was cut loose the television crew and sabotage the footage. We couldn't leave any evidence behind. WE HAVE TO GO! NOW!  I knew in my heart of hearts we should have stopped when my goldfish died. It was a sign from a higher power. Grab that fucking footage. Every tape you see. We have to find a man named Locus Fender. He knows where the money is hidden. If we return Bishop's money we might be in the clear. COME ON, ALF! Where are the tapes? BOOM? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now. Show me the tapes. I want to see them. Take us to Vegas. Lashandra and Lashindra were one step ahead of us... orchestrating Claremont's plan. You're breaking up... I can't hear you. What!!? He said... take his right arm. Yes... we sure are. EDNA! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE! We found the money in the safe. It was all there. Let's roll. Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve. Mescaline. With each passing second... reality eclipsed into the asphalt horizon. Soon the mescaline was pulsing through our veins. The bitch dosed the coffee. ALF! STOP THE CAR! Now the bitch was getting personal. I don't want to be alone. Yes. Take us to Vegas. Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter? I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man. But that's not the case with you, is it Taryn? Because I bet when you go to sleep alone tonight... it's my pussy you'll be dreaming of. The FBI was lying. The guys we nabbed weren't dead after all. I need you to book us a luxury suite. Put it on your credit card. Lateesha. What the hell have you gotten us into? They're gonna kill us unless we deliver all of the money.  Why should I help you? Okay. ALF! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN THERE!? Cut the drama and pullout 300K from one of the bags. THANKS, A-HOLE! Don't blow it. Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way. Okay. No need to bother. Yes I am. Sometimes. It can be dangerous when you don't know what to expect from a situation.  When you have no idea what could possibly happen next. There is ten million here. Minus the $300,000 finders fee you agreed to pay Claremont.  All porno... all the time.  It's an epidemic. I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything. In our descent into hell together, I'm glad I made this one exception. When I was a little girl... my mum took me to Las Vegas. She told me that it was the most dangerous place on earth. She told me that if you weren't careful... you could lose everything you'd ever earned in life in a split second.  You have to know when to cash out. Sweet dreams... Ms. Miles. I love you, mum. Time to go shopping. There are three kinds of people in the world. The rich... The poor... And everyone in between. If you're wondering what's true and what isn't... you can fuck off... because it's none of your Goddamn business. I'll never tell you what it all meant.  All that matters is that my mission is complete. I saved her. And when she is older... a woman named Domino will tell her that there is only one conclusion to every story."
gattaca,JEROME ,Jude Law," --Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say?  Only every time I'm in here. I'll tell you at the end of the week. The most unremarkable of events.  Jerome Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days away from a one-year manned mission to 951 Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt.  Nothing so unique in that.  Last year over one thousand citizens from every walk of life embarked on some space mission or other.  Besides, selection for Jerome was virtually guaranteed at birth.  He is blessed with all the physical and intellectual gifts required for such an arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second to none. No, there is truly nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow, except that I am not Jerome Morrow. I was conceived in the Riviera.  Not the French Riviera. The Detroit variety. They used to say that a child conceived in love, has a greater chance of happiness.  They don't say that any more. Those were early days--days when a priest could still persuade someone to put their faith in God's hands rather than those of the local geneticist. Of course, there was nothing wrong with me. Not so long ago I would have been considered a perfectly healthy, normal baby.  Ten fingers, ten toes.  That was all that used to matter. But now my immediate well-being was not the sole concern. My destiny was mapped out before me-- all my flaws, predispositions and susceptibilities - most untreatable to this day.  Only minutes old, the date and cause of my death was already known. I was born Vincent Antonio Luca.  And from an early age I came to think of myself as others thought of me - chronically ill. Every skinned knee and runny nose treated as if it were life-threatening. And my parents soon realized that wherever I went, my genetic prophecy preceded me. They put off having any more children until they could afford not to gamble - to bring a child into the world in what has become the ""natural"" way. It meant selling the beloved Buick. That's how my brother, Anton, came into the world - a son my father considered worthy of his name. By the time we were playing at blood brothers I understood that there was something very different flowing through my veins. And I'd need an awful lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere. Our favorite game was ""chicken"".  When our parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside the flags, as far out as we dared.  It was about who would get scared and turn back first. Of course, it was always me.  Anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail. My genetic scarlet letter continued to follow me from school to school.  When you're told you're prone to learning disabilities, it's sometimes easier not to disappoint anybody. I was popular enough until it got around that I wasn't a long-term proposition. Those who didn't know already could easily find out for themselves.  It was certainly no problem coaxing the information out of me. I didn't blame them.  You need to know if a prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage or life insurance or can hold down a decent job. My father was right.  It didn't matter how much I lied on my resum, my real C.V. was in my cells.  Why should anybody invest all that money to train me, when there are a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile?  Of course, it's illegal to discriminate - ""genoism"" it's called - but no one takes the laws seriously. If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a doorhandle... ...or a handshake... ...even the saliva off your application form. But for the most part we know who we are. And if all else fails, a legal drug test can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company. I didn't blame Anton for his free ride.  You can't blame someone for winning the lottery. It was the last time we swam together. Out into the open sea, like always, knowing each stroke towards the horizon was one we had to make back to the shore.  Like always, the unspoken contest. It confirmed everything in the minds of my parents - that they had taken the right course with my younger brother and the wrong course with me.  It would have been so much easier for everyone if I had slipped away that day.  I decided to grant them that wish. Like many others in my situation, I moved around a lot in the next few years, getting work where I could.  I must have cleaned half the toilets in the state. He fell.  Lucky it was only the second floor. Of course the best test score in the world wasn't going to get me in the front door unless I had the blood test to go with it. For the genetically superior, success is easier to attain but is by no means guaranteed.  After all, there is no gene for fate.  And when, for one reason or another, a member of the elite falls on hard times, their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous. One man's loss is another man's gain. I confess, at first I wondered if I had rescued a man who was already dead.  I have to know where you come from.  What about this?  You had to be a right-hander. Myopia is a dead giveaway - one of the earliest and most justifiable of the quality-of-life corrections.  Anybody with impaired vision is certain to be suffering from all the other deficiencies of a ""nonadvantaged"" birth. More than that.  You'll get used to it.  Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home. It's not too late to back out. What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?  What about the interview? The majority of people are now made-to-order. What began as a means to rid society of inheritable diseases has become a way to design your offspring--the line between health and enhancement blurred forever.  Eyes can always be brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body stronger, a life longer.  Everyone seeks to give their child the best chance but the most skilled geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few. Anyone who is the product of an altered DNA is proudly referred to as a ""DAN"", ""self-made man or woman"", ""man-child"". Those parents who, for moral or, more likely economic reasons, refrain from tampering with their offspring's genetic makeup or who fail to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children to a life of routine discrimination. Officially they are called ""In-Valids""*.  Also known as ""godchildren"", ""men-of-god"", ""faith births"", ""blackjack births"", ""deficients"", ""defectives"", ""genojunk"", ""ge-gnomes"", ""the fucked-up people"". They are the ""healthy ill"".  They don't actually have anything yet - they may never. But since few of the pre-conditions can be cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them as if they were already sick. By means of a donor I have cheated the system for the last four years to open doors that would otherwise be closed to me. In the guise of Jerome Morror I have risen quickly through the ranks of Gattaca.  Only one of the Mission Directors has ever come close to discovering my true identity. Strange to think, he may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life. We're still going ahead as planned? No bother. Last night?  I was at home. No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.  Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about you?  Where were you last night? Were you alone?  So we don't know for sure about you, either. Why don't we say we were together? I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?  Well, shall we say we spent the evening together? The Mission Director. They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag. He was still warm when they confirmed. The place is crawling with Hoovers. That's not the point.  You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow. Not as much as I'll miss your Stroganoff. I'd like to take one of your chefs with me. Let's get out of here. You drive. Keep going!!  Keep going!!  And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.  11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew. A day or so. You should be going instead of me. Up there they wouldn't be a problem.  It's okay, Eugene. --What car?--Go to sleep. It's all right.  You must be drunk to call me Vincent. Director, Napoleon's helping me today.  Don't worry about it.  We were looking at each other.  You stopped.  We were just looking.  Sorry, the wind caught it.  Have they found our friend?  It was a mercy-killing after all. Where? Does it have a name? Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene. Call German.  We can't stay here. They think I offed the Director. They found my eyelash. In a corridor.  Come on--we're taking off. --You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses. They'll recognize me. I'm sorry.  I think I was crying. You really had other offers? Mind if I borrow a tie? You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation. I've got enough on my mind without that.  Good choice. Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week. Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.  Yes...yes... Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.  Better not.  Don't want to give you a contaminated specimen...if you get my meaning. Thanks.  You never know where those swabs have been. Come on.  We'll miss it. You'll be next. What exactly is wrong?  Of course. Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.  You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since. Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.  I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander. It's not yor fault, Director.  If your predecessor were still around we may not be going to Gaspra at all. That's what I would call inconvenient.  What's with the plungers, Lamar?  What are you doing, opening a blood bank? Damn!!  You must be out of practise, Lamar.  Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.  I guess somebody beat me to it.  I'm sorry.  I've got plans.  She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong. Michael's. Everybody goes there.  Will you be okay?  We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer. By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, ""How are you?""  Forty-five minutes later I reply, ""Not bad.  How are you?""  You've never been here?  Let me order for you. So sure of what you can't do.  Do you even know what it tastes like, Irene?  Those checks take forever.  Let's walk.  It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.  Come on. We'll get it later.  Irene, please. You just did. You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left. But ""if it came to it"" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be? That's precisely what scaresme--that they won't do anything foolish or courageous or anything--worth a Goddamn. I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later. We could go together one day. How would you like to be yourself for the day?  How are you, Jerome? How the hell did you get here.  Irene. Not yet, I'm afraid. I guess I'm a slow learner. I'll see what I can do.  By the way, I left some trash in your locker.  From Vincent.  Maybe it's you who's forgotten.  What are you doing here, Anton? You almost sound like you believe that.  There are a few million miles to go yet.  Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?  God, even you want to tell me what I can't do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But you did, once.  Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible? Who are you trying to convince? Now is your chance to find out.  Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.  You wanted to know how I did it.  That's how I did it, Anton.  I never saved anything for the swim back.  Here, take it.  If you're still interested, let me know.  A year is a long time.  Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.  Why have you done this? Where are you going? Thank you.  What's this, Lamar? There's a problem, Lamar.  Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser-- We came from the stars so they say, now it's time to go back.  If I was conceived today, I would not get beyond eight cells, and yet here I am.  In a way they were right, I don't have the heart for this world.  The question is, why am I having so much trouble dying?"
bound,VIOLET ,Jennifer Tilly," I had this image of you, inside of me, like a part of me. We make our own choices, we pay our own prices. All part of the business. I want out. Like a part of me. Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator -- I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee? What happened to Rajeev? Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building. So this is temporary for you? I guessed you were straight black. My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor? Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools. No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin. Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ... You're doing everything yourself? That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic. Yeah ...  I bet your car is twenty years old. Truck.  Of course. I knew it. So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni? Oh, really. No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian. Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind. I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime. My pleasure. Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance. I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni. Yeah, come on in. I was doing some dishes and just as I pulled the stopper my earring fell in. It's one of my favorites.  That's why I got upset.  I know it probably seems ridiculous to you. I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called... Sure. Did you find it? I can't believe it!  You did it! Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something -- If you won't take money, how about a drink?  It's getting late.  You can't work all night. What do you want? A beer.  Of course. Sit down. Thanks again. You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky? Thirsty, maybe. Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now. That's a great tattoo. Beautiful labrys. Are you surprised that I know what it is? I have a tattoo, would you like to see it? A woman in upstate New York did it for me. Here.  Do you like it? It took her all day to do it.  She promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it was sore for a long time after.  I couldn't even touch it. But now I love the way it feels. Here, touch it. Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you. Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator. You don't believe me.  But I can prove it to you. You can't believe me because of what you see ... But you can believe what you feel. You see ...  I've been thinking about you all day. If I say yes, will you take your hand away? ...  yes. Please, Corky ...  please ... ...  kiss me. Yeah.  In here, C. I didn't expect -- Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar. She is working for Bianchinni. She's doing the work herself. Jesus, Caesar! That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar. I had to see you. I wanted to apologize. I'm not apologizing for what I did -- I'm apologizing for what I didn't do. Do you have a bed somewhere? ...  I needed that. You have to ask? Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it ""The |Business."" They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it. Basically. Almost five years. Yes, it is. What? The redistribution of wealth? I'm already in your bed. You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to. I'm glad you did. What do you want, Shelly? I had this image of you, inside of me ... Like a part of me ... You are so beautiful. What's wrong? Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee. You didn't want to see me, did you? What are you afraid of? I don't understand - ? We're not that different, Corky. Because it's the truth. Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you. I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder. I don't. What you heard wasn't sex. All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex. Work. You made certain choices in your life that you paid for.  You said you made them because you were good at something and it was easy.  Do you think you're the only one that's good at something? We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit. You mean Shelly? No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman. Fuck it!  I think you better leave. Try not to steal anything on the way out. Caesar, I'm leaving. Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here. Caesar wants me to stay. Thanks, Mickey. Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him. Yes. That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them. For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out. Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do. Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey. He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it. I used to be able to block it out. I would tell myself that I wasn't really there so nothing really mattered.  But I can't do it anymore. I've been making the same mistake Shelly made.  But now I know what |I want. I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky. You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again? If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register? Caesar is going to get the money and bring -- Shelly said it was over two million dollars. Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it. That's why I need your help.  You said you were good. You think I'm lying? Is that what you think? Do you think you know me like that? Oh my God ... Caesar, what happened? What are you going to do with it? Ummm ...  in the linen closet. You're having second thoughts. Yeah. He hung it up. To let it dry. It was unreal ... Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere like leaves. Then one by one, he ironed all of it. No.  But neither did I. All night long I listened to that sound. The sound of money. In his office.  I saw it this morning. I need to go to the store. It's in a case, on his desk. Yes. Johnnie? Like each other?  They hate each other. It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father. Gino Marzzone. That's his brother. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, twice. Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear. Johnnie hits on anything in high heels. He does it right in front of him. Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left. Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it. The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight. Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver. Poor boy, has to work so hard. Where will you be? Waiting for what? Shit!  Oh shit! Caesar, it slipped ...  I was trying to get ready ... I'm sorry.  It was an accident. Don't worry, I'll get some more. Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes. I'll clean this up and be back before you're even dressed. What if he sees you? You can't know for certain that he won't see you. I'm just asking, what if? When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off? I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it. Why? C!  Shit, I'm sorry! They were early. They just left, didn't they? You mean they weren't up here? That doesn't make any sense. Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs. I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes. It was him.  I'm positive. Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop. Actually, I didn't see Gino in the car. If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money. Jesus, that's beautiful. If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught? I won't. Caesar? Oh God ... Johnnie? Why?  Why would Johnnie do this? But you know he did it. Caesar, what are we going to do? C ... Caesar, maybe we should run -- I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late -- All right, Caesar. It's me. He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind. Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous. What if he doesn't run? Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here! okay, all right. He's coming ... The money?  The money's gone. But it could be anywhere. No. This is insane! I'm leaving!  This is crazy!  I don't want to be involved.  I don't want anything to do with this shit! The hell I can't! Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out. Caesar, this is crazy. You don't, you can't believe that I'm not drinking. No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic. Caesar ... For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says. What are you doing? Caesar, what are you going to do? What? Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone. What happened to them? Oh, no. Caesar, what are we going to do? Hello? The police? Gunfire?  Is this a joke? How do I know you are cops? All right. They're just cops. I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories. ...  thank you. Caesar, someone could see us out here. C? C? It's not here, Caesar. I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here. What are you doing? Who are you going to call? Caesar? Oh, God. I'll start packing.  You know what you have to do. Just hurry. Please, Corky ... Oh, thank God. I was so afraid you ... Corky, it worked!  He's going to run.  He needs to take care of the bodies to buy himself time, but as soon as he leaves, it's over. just a little longer and it's ours. Corky, I have to tell you something Run!  Just run! Don't tell him -- He can't kill you -- Not until he has the money! Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think -- You need the money just like we do. Let us go and we'll make a deal. Everything you couldn't. Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment. Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business. You murdered Gino! Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you. I'm sorry, Corky ... Hello, Caesar.  This is Gino. You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino. Good boy. We were in a car accident -- But everybody is all right. Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ... We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey. I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand. Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out. Mickey?  What are you doing here? Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt? I should have let him kill you. I knew I couldn't trust you. Come on.  Come on, please. Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey! He made me help him, Mickey, God, I was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's coming - Oh God! Corky? Corky! Stop! It's over, Caesar.  I called Mickey. He's on his way. Get out of here, Caesar.  If you want to live you had better start running. Caesar, don't. Caesar, you don't know shit. I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police. I know you will. Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this. But thanks.  Thanks for everything. Hey. I'm here, aren't I? No."
thor,THOR ,Chris Hemsworth," Another! Have you ever known me to be nervous? That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive? The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor. Some do battle, others just do tricks. The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles. Loki... Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered. Now that was just a waste of good wine. You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow? You're incapable of sincerity. Thank you. The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then: Stop. Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear. How do I look? You go ahead. Loki casts him a wary look. I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother. Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous! ...but never you. I know. And what is that? I swear. I swear. I swear. The Jotuns must pay for what they've done! ""All is well?!"" They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these I want to know why they-- And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms! He just broke your truce! We must act! Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three. March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again! This was an act of war! They got this far! As King of Asgard, I would-- It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.  This was to be my day of triumph. Yes, exactly! It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders. The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim. My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers. My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral. Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil? And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known? Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you? Loki looks startled. You are coming with me... We must first find a way to get past Heimdall. Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him. I have no plans to die today. Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex. Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims: Too late now. For what? We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow. It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world? What would you call it? How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan. Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby. I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers. And I am-- I demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together. How did your people get into Asgard? Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies. Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking. This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him. Know your place, brother... Next! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun. Come on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins. Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp.  Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead. Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet. Then go! I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them. Loki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God. Now! We'll finish them together! Why did you bring us back? I was protecting my home. There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him. Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt. While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls! And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words. Hammer... Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge! You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor. Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned. What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim? You dare threaten Thor with so puny How dare you attack the son of Odin! Then bring me a healing stone, you savages! He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying, furniture overturned. You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out. It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands slips free from its restraint. Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it? They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall. What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious.  This drink. I like it. It was delicious. I want another. I just did. I meant no disrespect. You have my word. Where?! Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks with him. To get what belongs to me. It's not what they say it is. Yes. He stops walking. If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know. All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others. I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it. Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved. I need a horse. Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer. Many times. You're brave to do it. But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm. You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself. Good strange or bad strange? You'll see soon enough. What you seek -- it's a bridge. More like a rainbow bridge. You're going to need this. Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you. Deal? No. Jane looks relieved. I'm going to fly out. Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater. The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust. You're big. Thor grins. Fought bigger. Just a man. Loki? What are you doing here? What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to What? Can I come home? But couldn't we find a way to-- No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here. Good-bye. Thank you for what you've done. Are you in love with her? Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest. I swear to you, I mean her no harm. I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than he's seen before. For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful. I will not fight him. Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder. He's fine. Not injured at all. Sorry, my friend. We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud. These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her. You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve. It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry. What's wrong? You must do this. You must finish what you've started. Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are. Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued. This is how my father explained it to me... You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates. She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family. Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves. To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior. If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your ""coffee."" My friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder. My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come. You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks. Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety. I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor. I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side. Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day. Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head across town, towards the Destroyer. Come on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod. Go, while you can! You can't help them now. Your job is to survive. She struggles to sit up. Live and tell those stories yourself. At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun and Fandral. But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins. Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan. The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely defenseless. Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer. Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard. Heimdall! Open the Bifrost! He would open it if he could. I fear the worst. Heimdall! Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally. Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it. He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.  Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me. No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons. Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused. You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been. Jotunheim... Why have you done this? He won't! You can't kill an entire race! I've changed. Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become? I will not fight you, brother. Loki, this is madness... Loki grins. Yet still not clever enough. With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis. All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. Loki watches him smugly. Forgive me. Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge. They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized by the debris, when -- No! But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the Observatory, disappearing out of sight. Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back into his father's arms. There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father. Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth. How is she?"
signs,GRAHAM ,Mel Gibson," Bo where's Morgan? Bo? This isn't a -- Morgan what's happening? Are... you... hurt? Did what Morgan?  ... Lee actually the reason I'm calling is about Lionel.  Was he at home last night with you or was he out and about with the Wolfington brothers?  Well, there was a little mischief done to our crops last night.  I know he's a fine boy... No one's saying otherwise.  Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it was him.  You could just talk to him and that would be enough for me... See it was kind of strange finding the crops like that.  The kids were... confused by it.  It would take the strangeness away if we knew it was Lionel and the Wolfington brothers just messing around...  The movies...  Are you sure?  Okay, then... Thank you for your patience Lee. Take him outside.  I'll call Dr. Reynolds. That was quick Edgar.  I only called you boys about two hours ago.  Don't call me Father.  Don't call me Father.  It's just Graham now.  You said something was strange. What's strange?  What about them? It's not broken.  Can't be by hand... It's too perfect. What was the first thing? Sounds like a virus.  Edgar, please don't call me Father. I don't hear my children. Did he hurt you?  I'm so sorry Morgan. Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed.  Make sure the knot's tight. They're tough cookies, those two. They think Houdini's playing with you up there.  At least it got them to sleep. Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one for you... What can make geometric shapes the size of a football field... and what would scare every animal in this county?  Have you figured it out yet?  You probably have...  Give me a hint Colleen... Is it bigger than a bread box? What's the matter? What's wrong with the water next to your bed? What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night? Right.  What are you thinking about?  It makes me feel better.  No. This is not an intelligent way to approach this.  Explain, act crazy?  I'm not going to curse.  It doesn't sound natural when I curse.  Explain noises.  No I'm not. Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger. I've lost my mind!  It's time for an ass whoopin'! I cursed. He's on the roof. Yes it was. It does seem kind of odd doesn't it? He definitely wasn't a midget.  I would say so. Yes, it was. Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it.  But we couldn't see him.  He stayed mostly in the shadows.  All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty.  There was someone watching our house last night.  He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just incase, it is something serious. Yes. Edgar, come inside. I have some upstairs. Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves? He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high. Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I have double A's in here. I know you're making a point Edgar. I just don't know what it is. Bo, you're too old to still be doing this.  The rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it.  Now what's wrong with this one? This one? This one? I don't think so. No. No. It's old Morgan. Turn up the volume Bo. Six months. And three weeks. It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me. No radio either... Just for a while. Only one.  Meet back in fifteen minutes. For Morgan Hess.  And it's not Father anymore. Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a -- reverend -- anymore.  I haven't been for six months.  You know this. I suppose it's in its usage. That's a curse. I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.  Is that understood? It's just static Morgan.  Turn it up and see. Let me see that please. It's broken Morgan.  It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay? We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this. I'm getting out now. It's probably picking up another baby monitor. See this is why we're not watching those news reports.  People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now. Morgan? Morgan, be careful. Hold on. Merrill you got her. You know something?  Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting. I can see how people can get carried away with this type of thing. It's a kind of faith.  It's an intoxicating thing to believe in something you can't see. You were always good at that... Believing in things you couldn't see.  You would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would have been wrestling for that baby monitor. It'll be secretly kind of sad for everybody, when this turns out to be -- all just make believe.  You're wasting your time here!  I'm not going to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or TV or anybody!  You're not going to get famous!  Okay.  Let's turn on the TV.  Find another tape.  That's true.  Yes.  That wasn't the answer you wanted?  ... There are all different ways you can tell that there's someone really there watching out for us. You see signs.  Sometimes they're little ones.  You think of someone. The phone rings.  They're on the phone... Sometimes they're big, like fourteen lights hovering over Mexico City.  Sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing.  But there are a lot of people watching this, who think it's a miracle.  A sign of God's existence.  It's all in how you look at things Merrill.  What you have to decide is what kind of person you are?  Are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by chance?  There you go.  Do you feel comforted?  What does it matter then?  Do you know what Colleen's last words were before they killed her?  She said, ""See"", and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said... ""Tell Merrill to swing away.""  Do you know why she said that?  Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head.  There is no one watching out for us Merrill.  We're all on our own. What's furry, furry rabbit? What time is it? The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell. Oh. Who wrote this book? That means they're unemployed. I don't know what got into me. Bimboo? I just asked his name. Looks a little like our house doesn't it? That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for now.  Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something. Hello? I'm going out for a few minutes. No one leaves this house.  No one. Ray Reddy's house. I think he just called here. Hello Ray. What happened Ray?  You're welcome Ray. Where you going Ray? Ray, did you see one of them? Hello.  The police are here... I am with them... I am a police officer.  I just want to talk to you.  We know all about the hoax.  We already took some of your friends downtown in the paddy wagon.  Paddy wagon? If you tell us your name and why you did it, we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.  Don't throw away your life son.  Douche bag. Tell me something Morgan.  In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile? Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade? What's two? What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something? We can choose to believe it and pack up and leave.  Or we can stay here.  Board up this house.  Hide inside our home and wait it out.  Either way, at least we'll be together.  All those in favor of the lake, raise your hand. All those in favor of home, raise your hand.  Because, they seem to have trouble with pantry doors. They decided to show themselves. I'm going to get back to the windows. We'll have to board up the bedroom doors. The family room. We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner. Spaghetti sounds great. What do you want, Morgan? Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill? Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon. What's the matter with everyone? Eat. I don't want to hear anymore talk like that.  And I don't want to see anymore faces like the ones I'm looking at.  We are going to enjoy this meal. Nothing can stop us from enjoying this meal!  Enjoy! Stop crying! Fine, if you all don't want to eat, then I'm going to have some of everything. This tastes so great.  It's happening. Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo? You came out of your momma and you didn't even cry.  You just opened your eyes and looked around at everybody.  Your eyes were so big and gorgeous, the ladies in the room gasped. They literally gasped.  Then they go, ""She's like an angel.""  They said, ""We've never seen a baby so beautiful.""  And you know what else happened?  When they put you on the table to clean you up, you looked at me and smiled.  They say babies that young can't smile... You smiled.  Let's go down now.  They already know we're here. Do you know what happened when you were born Morgan? You came out and your momma kept bleeding.  The doctors rushed you out of the room before I could even see you. While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you. I wanted your momma to see you first.  She had dreamed about you her whole life.  They waited till she felt better, then they brought you in.  They placed you right in her arms.  And she looked at you.  And you looked at her.  You just stared at each other for the longest time and then she said real soft, ""Hello Morgan, I'm you momma, you look just like I dreamed."" How temporary? Let go. We have to go in the basement. Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm? They're right behind the door. He was only a year and half old. He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar.  Your grandma said, ""No.""  He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it. I must have pulled his arm at an awkward angle.  His elbow popped right out of the socket. He didn't scream or anything.  His arm just flopped to his side and he got real still. I held him in my lap in the back seat as we drove to the hospital. I couldn't stop crying... We need to go into the basement now. You know what your Uncle Merrill did right after the doctor put his arm back in place?  He jumped off the table and gave me a hug.  He had already forgotten that I was the one who hurt him. I'm sorry I hurt your arm. We need something to wedge against the doorknob. You're scaring your sister. Merrill -- Merrill! Where's Bo?  I can't even imagine. They're just making noises. They're not trying to get in.  Why are they doing that? They're distracting us? Morgan, give me your flashlight. Is there an air vent in here? I can feel air. It's getting stronger. Pull him! We don't have his medicine. Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow it down together.  Feel my chest. Feel it going in and out.  Breathe like me.  Breathe like me. Stay with me.  Stay with me.

I'll bring the TV in here.  He's reading my -- There was an accident.  Drunk driving.  They weren't sure. Is he okay? She's talking... Which ambulance is she in? Why not? Pinned?

deception,JONATHAN ,Ewan McGregor," Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet? The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up. Right. I forgot. The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him -- Uh - no. No that's it, thanks. Solange, you're up so late? Just working late, that's all. Excuse me. Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them. They barely give him a glance as they continue their conversation. Actually, they lost by 4. Both pause, turn to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly. It was supposed to be a good game though. Yes? That certainly is                                               - something. Maybe they're developing a fly with a nursing degree. A superfly. Uh, Jonathan Messer. None. I'm from Worth and Berman. I've been over here a few wee-- A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off. The sound of zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening. Audit manager, yeah. Have laptop, will travel. What about you? Well, I didn't get your name for one.th-- The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out. Sorry - I didn't catch that?  Hello...? Sure. It's Wyatt, right? WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something very likeably ""on"" about him. Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to finish up. What about you? It's all right, if you enjoy working with numbers. Do you like being a lawyer? No - it's okay. Really. Since my senior year of college. They subsidized my graduate degree. Well - I guess you could say that. I was raised by a single mother, and she died when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people have had it worse. Are you? I don't know... I used to have friends. But it's like I've spent so much time trying to prove myself, working these hours                                                           - you can only do it so long before you look up and realize you've lost everyone. Just - fell out of touch. With everyone... And I try to meet people at work. I do. But it's always the same. To the accounting staff I'm a pain because for two weeks they have to hold their breath and hope I don't pick up on any of their screw ups. And to everyone else, I'm just a temporary fixture, so why bother? The truth is, this is the first meaningful conversation I've had in I don't know how long. It's like if I disappeared tomorrow, I'm not .sure anyone other than Solange would even notice - she's my neighbor. I live on what must be the only block in Brooklyn that still isn't hip. Yeah? Uh,.either one is                                               -- I mean the N and the R both stop there so, you know, either way, I mean, this is the right train. Yes. SOS Of Thanks. ""S"" enters her car. Jonathan wavers, wants to follow into her car but doesn't have the nerve. He enters a different car. I guess that's it. then. Nice meeting you. Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt Bose's office? The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance. Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here. She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's eyes follow her lazy finger down the list -- Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols after that. Wyatt's about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in the hall. Wyatt taps the lawyer's shoulder. Oh? I would've been happy to. Actually, it's a hybrid weave: natural gut and Kevlar. They're pretty obscure now. I should replace them, they're all frayed... Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was allergic to something in the solution. What - you mean sex? Oh, I don't know, not a whole- Maybe - four. Okay fine, just four. What about you? What? You just said everyone - We have the same phone. No, I wasn't                                                   -- of course you can- I guess I could go home and change. Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off. Who? What lie? So what happened to him?  You're pulling my dick, aren't you. Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks. Oh - great, actually. Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass? The wildest thing? Oh I don't know, I've never been too adventuresome. The lamest... Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it. Actually, that was probably a few months ago. I was flipping through money magazine and saw this small ad in the back. It read something like ""Are. you feeling all alone? Looking to meet women but have forgotten how?"" And-there was this number. Nothing actually. The phone just kept ringing. And that's it. Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up. Lame enough for you? .Hello? Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan. .All right... Goodbye. Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt. She wants to dance. She's a hooker. Wyatt shrugs, grinning. Hold on - you knew? What - are all the women here prostitutes? You seem to possess quite a store of international trivia. Three weeks. So you sleep with hookers? So how do you - meet your needs? Wyatt studies him a beat, another French love song drifting in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl. What were you going to say? And? You make it sound like a mob hit. Wyatt smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show. What you were talking about, before. Peoples' needs... Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin: Yeah. Yeah I did. Thanks. Forget it. It was funny. Wyatt smiles warmly, pats Jonathan's shoulder.  Hey. Could you let me out at the next corner over there, on 7th Avenue? Right.I just need the access codes for the accounts and sub-accounts? The Controller suddenly looks uneasy. You've got account numbers, but no access codes. Without those I can't get the banks to authorize statement verification.  Besides, how else can I steal the money? Nothing, I was just pulling your-- leg. I do need those codes though, when you get a chance. How'd you know it was- I'm just glad to be outside.  I've got to tell you, this has been great, meeting up for lunch. I used to just- A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's ringing. Jonathan rests his down on the ledge. No - no you didn't. Sounds exciting. Jonathan Mess- CLICK. Dead air. More puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat          - then replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger. Hello? A soft, electronic rustle from the other end... then: Excuse me? I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong-- Hello? The CRACKLE OF STATIC on the other end. Then: Actually I am, but I don't think I'm who The static on the other end worsens. I said I am free, but I                                         - The hotel? I - I guess, but -  Hi, it's Jonathan, I've got your cell! I guess you must have mine. I imagine you're in the air now, but call when you get this. if you do. Oh, and you got a call from someone who I'm...forget it, just call me. Jonathan hangs up. Excuse me? I've lived here all my life! I                                                                - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt, right? Yes. Yes we did -  Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and I., we don't know each other...? She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips. What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain there's been some kind of mistake. No - I mean, yes, but - Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          - Well could you tell me the name of the guest who was staying there? Actually, the thing is... it's okay. Forget it. Hello? Hi! How's London? Yeah. Listen, last night...um...I met this- Hello, um - I'm sorry to bother you                             - Through a friend. wait - Jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up.  Are you free tonight? He shuts his eyes, ready for a hang up. A long silence. Where. Right... The Plaza? The Shakespeare? Excuse me, um - I'm sorry to disturb you - She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" in her hand. I'm - supposed to meet someone here and- I'm sorry, what floor? She rolls her eyes.  Oh - so I should...? So are there a lot of - people - who do this? She turns to him with a look of growing impatience -- when the CREAK OF A CART causes them to glance up: a ROOM SERVICE WAITER is crossing past the far end of the hall. Jonathan turns back to find her staring at him uneasily. Well, a friend of mine - He's                                                          - well, he was going out of town.  I'm doing something wrong, aren't I? Can I ask you something? Why do you do this? Well - good night.  Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess you're busy.with stuff over there.  I've been kinda busy too! I've been wondering - did you mean for me to take your phone? I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can see you grinning right now. Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps inside -- Anyway, I just wanted to say... thank you. SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SWELLING: to herald a MONTAGE: J'ai ete tres occupe. with work. He's exhausted. And no longer so exhilarated by his nightly activities. Maybe later, okay? Before we...um, the thing is                                   - I know you. She glances up, curious                                        - her hand lingering by the front clasp of her bra. Not 'know' exactly, but we sort of met before. In the Times Square subway station. It was raining... You had no umbrella. You were soaked. Then you asked me if the N train stops at Canal. She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles warmly and continues to unbutton her blouse. Wait. This just seems strange, that's all. Maybe. I don't know, it's just                                 - It's just that- Wait - don't go. She glances back curiously. What I mean is, by any chance... are you hungry? sorry, I'm a messy eater. Me too. Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes the napkin, dabs it in water and cleans him up. Thanks. By the way, my name's- The 'rules' seem to specify no conversation either. as., They are a little rigid, aren't they? But I think we should obey the 'no names'. It'll be fun! Ah, but I know.yours begins with an 'S'. Sir Is that right? I saw part of the monogram on your briefcase. ./ S If I see-Excellent work, Holmes.  Maybe I'll tell you if.you guess... Her face is an inch from his, the moment mysterious   and           sexy.  Hmrn...what do we know of her? She sports a camel coat, a briefcase and possesses no umbrella. I deduce...her name is 'Sybil'. 'S' laughs. Sarah? Sara? Samantha? Sandra? Susan? She makes a little sound of encouragement. Hun... Aha! Sue?  Suzie with a 'z'? You're saying my name is 'Suzie'? is it? I've got to tell you, I'm much better with numbers... How about Sonia? Sheena? Wait - Sophie! You're definitely a Sophie. Either. How about Syd? As in Syd Charisse? She was Cyd with a 'C'! But maybe you spell it with an 'S'? ,, S . If I do not. Steffi? Sexy Steffi soaking in the:rain?. She                                                         mock-frowns. Sally? Sally with three 'l's? She                                                         shakes her head, amused. Jonathan rubs his chin. Hmmm. Hmmm. The mysterious 'S' alighted from the train at Canal Street. She may well be from 'downtown'...hmm...ah! Of course! How foolish I've been; Sinead. 'S'                                                         giggles, charmed by him. Stella? Sky? Sunbeam? Absolutely. To me you are 'Sunbeam'. Can I ask what you do for a living? You first. I sit behind glass and watch people pass like fish. She smiles - a more interesting answer than she expected. Nahh, I'm... I'm kind of an accountant. us,, Now I bet that's just what you wanted to do when you were a kid! Oh yeah. I'm living the dream. Feel free to leave now. u S Still here. So what about you? A pro tennis player. You're kidding? Really! I loved the idea of sitting in that big, high chair.  'The ball was good,'Mr McEnroe.' I can see it. An 80's new wave love song comes on the radio. She beams, reaching across Jonathan to turn it up. Trust me, it's not a pretty sight. I'd like to see you again. Not in a hotel. it S+ "" Hmm. I'd have to think about that. How about tomorrow? /. S to It is tomorrow. She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes her eyes and drifts off. Jonathan gazes over at her. The perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe. And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away. He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from under her -- when she stirs and nuzzles closer. He looks over Hey! Are you back in town? Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night - at the Hudson. Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl. She's a member of your naughty little sex club. I have broken all the rules and had an honest-to-God conversation. I'd like to say it's a long story but it's not. When you are coming back, you gotta meet her. I-have no idea, I don't know all that much about her. All I know is I can't wait to see her again. What do you mean by that? Yeah, yeah, yeah but - sometimes you just have to go with what you feel, don't you? Hello? Hello? Intermittent static on the other end. And then what sounds like a WOMAN GASPING; it's unclear if it's a sound of pleasure or pain. .Hello? The Gasping comes faster; Jonathan debates hanging up - when the gasps halt,--replaced by the faintest whisp__of_ a female voice: ""No... No please..."" There's no mistaking the tone now it's fear - then. suddenly a shrill, terrified SCREAM... - and the line goes dead. Jonathan stares breathlessly at the phone in his hand, like he's just witnessed something awful. He quickly checks the display: ""Number Unavailable."" Jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was ""S""- - when the phone rings again. He hesitates, then picks up. Sure you don't mean ""clashing?"" She laughs                                                      - then notices how tense he seems.  It could've been a prank. . Now you're the one who looks scared. You gotta respect him; he just keeps at it. A WAITER arrives and sets down a laminated menu - entirely in Chinese. ""S"" points to the characters like an expert. J! $ Ft We'll have this... and this... oh, and let's try one of these. Thank you. The Waiter nods, walks off. What did you order? How do you know we'll like it? This is so...not my life. More than you know. Ever since that night on the subway - I haven't stopped thinking about you. She lowers.her eyes. Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out. She slowly looks up again, touched. No. it S., Even so, I'm not sure I believe you. Jonathan's look, 'why not?' Point taken. But I've thought about you a lot. And sometimes during. She laughs. The waiter brings them their drinks. So how come you got involved in the club? She frowns slightly, thinks. s . If Wouldn't it be great if you could just meet someone and not have to do the 'work/ family/previous relationships' thing? Isn't who we are right now so much more interesting than where we've come from? Sure... but that didn't really answer my question. She reaches over and takes his hand, holds it tenderly. S of I know it seems like I'm holding out on you, but I'm not. It's just                                  - I turned thirty this year, and I made this vow to live only in the present. And it's good, you know? And yes, maybe it's because there are things in my past I don't care to think about - but that's the same for everyone, isn't it? He nods, still holding hands, loving every moment of this. is S . I like you. I hope you like me. Can't that be enough? Jonathan smiles, completely disarmed by her. The waiter brings their food and goes. I wasn't asking for an autobiography, you know. I was just curious. You mean the intimacy without intricacy. Oh - no thanks. Hey, are you all right? Too late.                                                       -- I want all the complication you've got. She gazes at him, blinks back her emotions. it Sc, Your glasses. They're fogging up. She reaches out and gently removes his glasses. Maybe you should stay. She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately. Again they feel the awning's drops, and Jonathan moves to shelter them - - only ""S"" leans into him instead, leading him out from under the awning, the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces as they continue to kiss, the moment purely exhilarating. wiping the rain from her face, Jonathan gazes at her, soaked and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he's just breathed for the very first time. Rack focus on a hotel down the street, its neon sign reads: ""Hotel Lotus."" Perfect. They watch together. s_.. So were you any good? Yeah. But I didn't want it enough. The guys who make it really need it. I played recently, first time in years. I've got this friend - a new friend, he's great. Maybe you'll meet him one day. Anyway, we played and he creamed me. But I knew I was better than him. He said I had no killer instinct. I's. it .I don't know, I think you're a pretty determined character. On a level with this feller? He points to 'Duck on bike' watching over them like a charm. I know we said we wouldn't rush. But for the record, I'm doing everything Ican to apply.the brakes here. S                                                             . of Me too. It's a wise and mature choice we've made. But say we did, just say... Mmhmm...? Say we were to suddenly tear off these robes... Would that be such a terrible thing? For two people in Manhattan - To consummate their deep human needs in a frenzy of...of... Fucking and sucking? Beautifully put. Its. I. You were saying? Who - who would blame these two people? And who would know? His face is inches from hers                                  - when she rolls over and reaches for a glass of water on the night stand. She sips her water, as she turns back to Jonathan. Still, Jonathan picks up on her subtle shift. is everything okay? She starts to say something, then stops herself and nods instead. She sets down her glass, starts to get out of bed. Where are you going?  Ice, huh? That's all right, I'll go. He hops off the bed, grabs an ice bucket from the mini bar and a key card from the table, he surreptitiously adjusts his penis                                                           : and goes to the door. He's about to turn the handle when -  Yes? She hesitates a cryptic beat - then shakes her head, and smiles at him with immense tenderness. Jonathan beams back. its . P1 Hurry, okay? He blows her a kiss, she blows one back. Almost in SLOW MOTION. She looks stunning. Would you like some help, ma'am? I can't get the card to work. He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel: red. He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence. Hello?... Hello? He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into the door. Nothing. Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns green.                                                          - A millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into help... .I saw blood on the bed and then someone hit me. When I came to, she was gone. I don't know.  It starts with an 'S'. I think. No! No, she's just a person. A friend. Of course she has a name! I just don't - we have to find her - something must have happened to her! I told you, whoever did this must have cleaned it up while I was out. My wallet and keys                                          - they're gone! They were right here... He looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit lies.    His SCARF is gone too. What?! She didn't do this, okay?! Something happened to her! You don't understand, we were... Wait! He sees something on the floor between the bed and night stand. He runs to to pick it up: a Chinese Gum Wrapper. This                                                        -- this was hers... Jonathan clutches it desperately, the lone trace of her existence. The Guards exchange a look like he's INSANE. I told you how we met. I don't                                                         -- it's not like that. That's... that's the way it works. Not at first -- look, I know how it sounds, but I'm telling you, whoever hit me must have - I don't know -- taken her. Maybe even... He stops himself, shuddering to think of the implications. I'm not crazy, okay?! A woman vanished back there! There was blood all over the goddamn bed! He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when A CELL PHONE RINGS: it's Russo's. She pauses, struck by the genuine desperation in Jonathan's face. She finally picks up. What am I supposed to do? An awkward silence, then: I'd like to go now. Is that all right? Can I just                                                          - can I go? .Your ad says                                                     24-Hour Locksmith... Well how soon could you-... Fine. He opens a file: it's where he keeps his passport. He stuffs it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a folder marked ""CREDIT CARDS."" Sorting through old statements, he finds the line: ""To report a card lost or stolen..."" This is Jonathan Messer. I won't be able to come in today. I'm - pretty ill... 'Duck on Bike' sits on his nightstand next to his glasses. I was told you sell this gum here? The Old Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a candy display. In one box is the same gum. A woman - a white woman - buys this brand of gum. I need to find- The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy Chinese. I'm sorry, I don't                                              -- Do you know the woman I'm talking about? A white woman...? Please, it's very important that I                              -- Can you ask if she knows the name of the white woman who buys this gum? The Girl questions the old woman in rapid Chinese. She takes. a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The girl nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan. Hello? No - she's not. Not last night... no. Russo studies his strained expression a suspicious beat.  The Hudson? Wyatt, it's me. I need to talk to you. Call me, OK? Please. Yes, I need to get in contact with one of your attorneys, Wyatt Bose - it's extremely important. He's working out of the London office right now. If I could speak to his assistant or someone who'd know how-to reach him immediately... B-o-s-e. First name Wyatt. Yes... The. receptionist frowns. Messer. Jonathan Messer. I'm an auditor from worth and Berman. Yes                                                             -- yes, I'm                         --- He works here. I've seen him working here. I net him here. A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here. He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion. I've seen him in the halls                                      - for Chrissake we smoked pot in the conference room! Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns, when Jonathan spots a LAWYER - Thank God. Look, I'm trying to find Wyatt. Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him, cracking jokes in the coffee lounge. FLASH ON SAME SCENE: Wyatt looks up, eyes meet Jonathan's. Jonathan smiles in greeting... but Wyatt just nods coolly. Hold on, you're telling me you don't-- He said he was in London with Mr. Rutherford, paperinga - Wyatt - .by a MAN in his early 60's, his WIFE behind him; both strike us as wealthy, downtown patron-of-the-arts types. Sorry, I                                                        -- I need to speak to Wyatt. Wyatt Bose. He lives here. Not in this building - in this apartment. But... I was right-here-with him... The Man takes a step back, catching his wife's equally wary expression, his hand making for the chain lock. From a gallery! In Munich - the one that Herr Kleiner handles? The art dealer downstairs? But Wyatt smoke to him. When I was working over here, you made a photocopy of my I.D..' You have to. She looks at him', sees his desperation. Hello? Oh - right, I was just - checking in, to see if you had any leads...  Oh - okay, thanks- I told you before - I don't                                                    -- why are you- I cancelled them all, the day they got stolen. Kevlar? Yes                                                            - yes, I'm              -- I know, okay? I know your name isn't Wyatt Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I know you're trying to frame me for it, so - so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And where is she?! If you hurt her I swear to God I'll... Jonathan falters, unsure where he's going with this and realizing he's now talking to himself. It's me. I need to talk to you. He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something. Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the room, grabs the nearest blunt object: his tennis trophy. QUICKLY CUT SHOTS of Jonathan searching his apartment, his trophy raised as a makeshift weapon. wait! Wait, right there! Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her. He looks around, hears the distant: .nimble of afar. off train, and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him capable of: he jumps onto the tracks! He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails, eyes darting along the track, anxious to avoid the third rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he races for I thought you were dead! She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. And all at once he's hit with a crushing realization: You are in on this, aren't you?! She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion - then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again. How do you know him?  Damn it answer me! She halts, slowly looks back at him. of cam Through the club. He caught me trying to steal his wallet. Jonathan looks confused; she's struggling to stay composed but looks like she could break down at any moment. So everything between us - was nothing? She fights back tears. Go through with what? Then why didn't you? Wait, Jonathan? I'm Jonathan. Jonathan Messer. You're                                                           -? O.S. we hear the approaching roar of an INCOMING TRAIN... ii S                                                             7f Did you go to the police? I can't. He's framing me for murder. What? He killed a woman from the club, someone I'd been with. ""S"" is shocked., instantly terrified. Clearly she had no idea. I/ S$f Jonathan, you have to leave! Do you understand? You need to get the hell out of here, he's going to kill you! The roar of the incoming train is growing LOUDER... Don't you understand? He's going to kill - - when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out... and swipes ""S"" out of Jonathan's view. Jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its passengers prevent him from getting a look at her. Just then the TRAIN DOORS OPEN WITH THE NOISE of passengers getting on and off. Panicked, Jonathan cranes his neck, trying to see her through the windows. Jonathan Messer Jonathan hangs up. Takes an angry breath. Presses redial. Hello...? Not a word from the other end. We barely make out BREATHING. Wyatt? Is that you? Jonathan takes a tentative step forward, as if fearful that the least movement will cost him this connection. Say something damn it! From the receiver we hear a well-exhaled breath. And then: What do you want from me? Answer me! Why are you doing this to me?! I'm going to find you, you hear me? I'm- CLICK. Dead air. Hello?... Hello?! Jonathan SLAMS the phone down, tension in his face joined by a new emotion, something closer to. fury. I'm going to find you. Follow-up? No. No luck. Are you free tonight? Do you know Wyatt Bose? What about William Bansky? Does that name-- She darts.for the ""Door Open"" button, but he blocks her path. Please, I'm not trying to scare you, I just                                                            -- I'm looking for someone.and it's very important that I find him. she tries to push past him, again Jonathan blocks her. He does this too - or he did. someone had to give him the numbers. Someone let him in. If I can-'find who it was that knew him, they might know where he's                                 -- she suddenly kicks him in the shin with a spiked heel. Jonathan grasps his leg - she presses the button and is out the opening doors before he's even looked up. SOUND ADVANCE: TENSE CLACKING of computer keys... I need to ask you something, it's incredibly important... You told him. About this. A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette. Wait - thank you.  Have you ever run into him again? Getz? who's James Getz? Shit. Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed. Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name. ""Sort no contact information available."" Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types: ""Holloway Reed"" then decides to add the word ""missing."" An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: ""BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED."" A head-shot style photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his name: ""Reed Holloway."" Can I print this out? I live here.  How did it start? Just                                                            - give me a minute. I guess it is. This is Detective Russo, NYPD, badge number 274655.                                                                                                                     1   just need some information from you guys. Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally - You've got a case, a missing person named William Bansky. I'm wondering if you can tell me the date he was last seen? That's it, thanks. Jonathan quickly hangs up, equally encouraged and chilled by the connection he's made. TILT DOWN to a post-it, on which he's scribbled: ""BOSE = BANSKY = HOLLOWAY."" To this he adds: ""= JAMES GETZ"" Actually, my card was stolen. The thing is, I already used your automated system and...look, this passport's all I have left, it's the only thing proves who I am and now I'm down to like my last ten dollars here, so... Jonathan's cool is cracking. The Teller wrinkles her brow. Give me a goddamn break.  Oh no? In the last few days I've seen a woman I thought might be dead turn up alive and a woman I assumed was alive turn up dead, both at the hands of a guy about whom everything I know is apparently a lie. I've had my building set on fire, my neighbor nearly killed, and my apartment ransacked. So please forgive my language, but it's been one fuck of a week. The stunned Teller stares back at him slack-jawed. Look, I know I'm just another face on this side of the glass, I get that. But I'm begging you, as one human being to another, please let me into your life just long enough to help me out here. Please. The Teller stares back at him a beat - and nods. She starts quickly typing into her monitor, finally looks up. Well, like I                                                    -- wait, what request? Where is she? Where is she?! A terrifying silence - Jonathan erupts: Goddamn it tell me what you did to-- I can't                                                         - I have no idea how to even- It won't work - they screen for stuff like this. It'll be discovered eventually. This account overseas                                   - it's in my name, isn't it? A moment of tense silence. Jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat; then: Why'd you pick me? Wyatt raises a brow, vaguely amused the question. The ad - in Money magazine... Why should I believe you? Everything you told me was lies. I wondered if you were monitoring this. Not until I see her.  The transfer's impossible without an access code. And there's no way I'm entering it until I'm sure that she's safe. So you tell me. How do we do that? Wyatt still remains unnervingly silent. We tighten on Jonathan, holding his breath, any plan he's concocting clearly hinging on this... Where is she? Bansky's dead, isn't he? Not unti"

serenity,MAL ,Nathan Fillion," What was that? He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old soldier, but just as startled. Was that the primary buffer panel? Did the Primary Buffer Panel just fall off my gorramn ship for no apparent reason? Another buck -- I thought Kaylee checked our entry couplings! I have a very clear memory of it -- Define ""Interesting"".  This is the Captain. There's a little problem with our entry sequence; we may experience slight turbulence and then explode.  Can you shave the vector -- Just get us on the ground! Jayne, how many weapons you plan on bringing? You only got the two arms... I don't plan on any shooting taking place during this job. No grenades.  No grenades. First Mate ZOE enters from the lower level. Her mode of dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of Mal's. Talk to your husband. Is the mule prepped?  Kaylee! He enters:  Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the doorway, raising his voice above the din. You told me -- My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her. Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doc. I'll look for that next time.  No no, that's not a thing I'm interested in talking over with --  I hear the words ""that's final"" come out of your mouth ever again, they truly will be.  This is my boat. Y'all are guests on it. He heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to: And it's time your little sister learned from your fine example. Some of our jobs are trickier than others -- Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'. It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine. The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of: She's a reader. Sees into the truth of things; might see trouble before it's coming. Which is of use to me. I do, and it's a fact me and mine have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves. I got one purpose here: keep this boat in the air. I take the jobs I get -- which is less and less, case you ain't been keeping track. He starts away, Simon still keeping pace. So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you. Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him: If Fanty and Mingo are right about the payroll, this could look to be a sunny day for us. Doctor, I'm taking your sister under my protection here. If anything happens to her, anything at all, I swear to you I will get very choked up. Honestly. There could be tears. He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him... Alliance payroll. There's peace enforcing squads stationed all about this quadrant. Can't use credits out here -- they got to pay their boys in cashy money. Which once a month rests here. You ready to go to work, darlin'?  Right. Great. Let's go. Hands and knees and heads bowed down! Everybody, now! Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others. Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks. Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very much new in design. The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! -- bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold. You've probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we are after is not yours. So let's have no undue fussing. As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office, finding the small vault locked.  The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive. Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in. Is there a fed down there? Be truthful. War's long done. We're all just folk now.  Listen up! We are coming down to empty that vault! The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below. Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and we avoid any necessary organs... Well you don't want it to look like you just gave up...  Every heist, he's gotta start yelling my name --  Get on the mule. (to the guard, pointing to the You get everyone upstairs in there and you seal it. Long as you got air you don't open up, you understand? Zoe take the wheel -- Get in the vault with the others -- It's too many. Drive, Zoe. A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator, pure. It disappears over the rooftops. Drive! Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust. As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun. He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back. Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the chest, slumps down dead. They wanna run us down. The up- close kill. River is squashed down on her back, being very small. Grab on! Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol. Is he okay? A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top. He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth -- Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op. 4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other. Set course for Beaumonde.  First thing, I want these bod -- Simon suddenly punches him in the face, causing Mal to stumble back, and Simon to shake his hand in pain. I'm a hair's breadth from riddling you with holes, Doctor -- She IS fine! Except for bein' still crazy, she's the picture of health! Seems I remember a talk about you giving orders on my boat. No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying tourists anyhow. We'll be on Beaumonde in ten hours time, you can pick up your earnings and be on your merry. Meantime you do your job. Patch up my crew. A beat. Doc made his call. They's as babes in a basket when we took 'em in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man has to cut loose, learn to stand on his own. I had to shoot him. What the Reavers woulda done to him before they killed him... We couldn't take the weight. Woulda slowed us down. Mule won't run with five. I shoulda dumped the girl? Or you? Or Jayne? And go to Fanty and Mingo with air in our mitts, tell 'em ""here's your share""? They'd set the dogs on us in the space of a twitch, and there we are back in mortal peril. We get a job, we gotta vo make good. Washenters from the bridge. Maybe that's why we lost. She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her. It's not my fault the Doc's got no stomach for Rim living -- What? Swept you into his cleanly arms? Made tidy love to you? They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat: Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively. Oh god! I can't know that!  Mingo. Fanty. He's Fanty. You're Mingo. Fanty's prettier.  Feel to do some business? Which means at least four of the guys already in here are yours. All's one. I'll just keep Jayne with me. Go. Go get yourselves a nice romantic meal.  It's business. We're fine. They leave and the four remaining men sit. Fanty tosses a few coins to a saloon-girl, who does a little fan-dance... ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently blocked by her little dance. Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot. Yeah, they're a fine bunch of ruebens. So I'm noticing. Is there a problem I don't know of? You got 25% of a sweet take kissing your foot, how come we're not dispersing? Well here's a foul thought. I conjured you two were incompetent; sent us out not knowing there were V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking you picked us out because you did. River... I think maybe we ought to leave. She's still napping just now. And I believe you've got some storytelling to do. It's likely. I know she meant to Ad kill me 'fore the Doc put her to sleep, which how exactly does that work anyhow? ""In case something happened."" You feel to elaborate on what that something might be? I mean they taught you that fancy safeword, they must've figured she was gonna, what -- start uncontrollably crocheting? And you never did ask. Mal grabs him and throws him against the wall, in his face. My ship. My crewi You had a gorramn timebomb living with us! What if she went off in the middle woo of dinner, or in bunk with Kaylee, did that give you a moment's pause? Simon looks at Kaylee, the truth of Mal's words hitting him. It's crossed my mind. What about this? Did this make the... puppet theatre? You can do that? Can you go back? See if anybody spoke with her 'fore she acted up, -40 made any kind of contact with her... Mr Universe works the screen. The image rewinds and stops on River coming up to it, looking at it. She whispers the word, ""Miranda"", and starts to move away. Um... please? Mr Universe has a third screen showing the commercial as Subliminal. It's a subliminal message broadwaved to trigger her. Hope that ain't for me, Shepherd. Then I really hope it ain't for me. Weren't River that did it, you know that. Somebody decided her brain was just another piece of property to take, fenced it right Vd up. Hiding ain't a plan? .but they'll be coming. Alliance is after this girl with a powerful will. I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment. I coulda left her there. I had an out -- hell, I had every reason in the 'verse to leave her lay and haul anchor. You just think that 'cause my eyes is all sorrowful and pretty. Sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd. I ain't looking for help from on high. That's a long wait for a train don't come. It's of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world. Have to tell me about that some time. Whuh huh nuhwhat? Inara. REVERSE ON: Inara on Mal's screen. We see her from about chest level up. She, presumably, sees the same. Good as any.  Naked as the day I come cryin'. How's your world? Still at the Training House? I remember it as nice enough. picturesque. You could use a gun hand? Payment is never not a factor. I could sound out the crew... This pot like to boil over soon? Well, it would be, I mean I would like to... Kaylee's been missing you something fierce -- Yeah, you left a... got some of your stuff in a trunk, never did get a chance to drop it off. I didn't look through the... stuff... just sundries I expect. Trap. If that's the case, then Inara's already caught in it. She wouldn't set us up willing. Might be we got a shot at seeing who's turning these wheels. We go in. Y'all were watching, I take it. Guilty glances. 140 You see us fight? Trap. They're about. Find us a home. I'll take the shuttle in closer. Zoe, ship is yours. 4dO He starts out, turns back to Zoe. Dear Buddha, please send me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and -- You invited me. Well that makes you kind of a tease, doesn't it? Which led me to the conclusion that you must be in some trouble. For a woman schooled in telling men what they wanna hear, you ain't much of a liar. What are you doing? Speak your piece. She is a mite unpredictable. Mood swings, of a sort. It usually is. Way I remember it, albatross was a ship's good luck... til some idiot killed it.  Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint. The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he moves, Mal counters. You really don't. I got no need to beat you. I just wanna go my way. All I gotta do is let you take one more thing away from me. I've had a lot of things taken in my time. And it may just be that this is one too many. Well I'm a whimsical soul. I got no notion that I'm being heroical at all. Any more than I think you're really just a harmless bureaucrat come to help me out. You move like a killer. The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues: You do that, best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord. Advice from an old tracker: you J wanna find someone, use your eyes. Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I never credited the Alliance with an over-abundance of brains. And if you're the best they got... Why is it that the greater scheme always makes everything not that great? Great! He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway. The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind. No back up? We're making an awful ruckus... I'd start whistling. .I had him...  I think that I was winning! 4 You sure you remember how it -- He nearly falls over as:  I'm fine... He didn't beat me up --  Give the two of them up. Go my way. Cutting them loose ain't the same as handing them over. Don't know who or what, but it's on River's mind. Conjure it might be the reason he's after her. Look, we get back to Haven in a 'r/ few hours time -- You wanna run this ship?  Well you can't! I didn't start this. Are you telling me that because you think I don't know -- I came looking for you. I start fighting a war I guarantee you'll see something new. But you fog things up. You always have -- you spin me about. I wish like hell you was elsewhere. The other way! Find her and-do not engage! Everyone piles out the other way. Simon remains, to look in the window. Check the shuttles. She coulda 40 snuck in. He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires. The government's man, he says you're a danger to us. Not worth helping. Is he right? Are you anything but a weapon? I've staked my crew's life on the a - person-,-- - actual and whole, and if I'm wrong you'd best shoot me now.  Or we could talk more... Because there isn't one. It's a blackrock. Uninhabitable. Terraforming didn't hold, or somesuch. Few settlers died. Half of writing history is hiding the truth. There's something on this rock the Alliance doesn't want known. Shouldn't've been you. I'm so sorry, it was... they should've hit us. They should've hit me. I seen. You did what's right. Doc'll bring you round. I look to be bored by many more sermons 'fore you slip -- don't move -- Yes you are. Book coughs up blood, grabbing Mal. Urgent, almost angry. Come on, keep it up -- Book grabs Mal's face, talks as though replying to something: Don't talk at me like a righteous man. You are a killer of children. So me and mine got to lie down and Why? Do you know why? You will never see River Tam. I'm telling you this. She ain't buckled yet. And the 40 only reason you're talking such a lot is you can't get a fix on us. Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble. Only- many-I-know-who still --bel i-eved- in sin just died by your hand. Not a solitary thing. Get these bodies together. Zoe, you and Simon are gonna rope V0 'em together. Five or six of 'em. I want them laid out on the nose of our ship. Kaylee, I need you to muck the reactor core, just enough to leave a trail and make it read like we're flying without containment, not enough to fry us. Kaylee, you got a day's work to do and two hours to do it.  Jayne, you and Wash hoist up that cannon mount. Goes right on top. I mean to live. I mean for us to live. The Alliance won't have that, so we go where they won't follow. This is how it works. Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me anymore, this is your port of harbour. There's a lot of fine ways to die. I'm not waiting for the Alliance to choose mine. He walks through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the Alliance fighter. Struggling to get out is the badly wounded pilot. He sees Mal coming and raises his hands in surrender. Mal shoots him in the head, turns back. Didn't see you. Anything of use in there? You don't have to stay in the shuttle, you know. There's empty rooms, if you wanna sleep awhile. Cheerful fellow.  Did you really miss this place? Why did you leave? Site does lo9}E-at-- t -m- I, uh, I'd better go check on the VW crew. See how the inevitable mutiny is coming along. They both want to say more. They don't. He goes. Nothing at all? Find it. Well something sure as hell ain't right... WIDER ANGLE: They're in a CITY. Gleaming metal, spread out for miles in every direction. Portions decimated by fires long since cold, others overgrown with weeds, but mostly intact. But silent, as if trapped in amber. Beacon's up ahead. Poison? Place must've gone hermetic when the power blew. Sealed 'em. There's gasses that kill painless, right? Anybody want to bet there's plenty of food around? I seen so much death... I been on fields carpeted with bodies, friends and enemies -- I seen men and women blown to messes no further from me than you. But every single one of those people died on their feet. Fighting. Or, hell, running away -- doing summat to get through. This is... This report is maybe twelve years old. Parliament buried it, and it stayed buried til River dug it up. This is what they feared she knew. And they were right to fear, 'cause there's a universe of folk that are gonna know it too.  They're gonna see it. Somebody has to speak for these people. He pauses. Everyone waits. That the same grandma told you 4 there was an evil dwarf spirit living in your well? Mr Universe. We haven't the equipment to broadwave this code, but he can put it on every screen for thirty worlds. He's pretty damn close, too. No. He takes a long moment, his jaw tightening imperceptibly. We won't be long. You'll let us know if anyone else comes at you? We're too close for them to arm -- Chickens come home to roost... They are suddenly JOLTED by a glancing blow from another ship -- Wash struggles to control her --  What does that mean? Where's the back up? Where's the back up? He and Wash are frantically flipping buttons -- the ship whirs to a semblance of life - -  Everybody to the upper decks! Strap yourselves to something! Head inside! Come on. Jayne, rearguard. Zoe slows, looking around her. We all stay together -- Then shut 'em and hide til -- Tell me you brought 'em this time... Jayne smiles grimly, tosses Mal a grenade as he pops his own and fastballs it at the Reavers.  Zoe... are you here? She looks up at him. You hold. Hold till I'm back. He takes off -- passes Inara, the two of them holding a look for as long as they can. Then he's in the elevator and gone. Jayne moves over to Zoe.  Guy killed me, Mal. Hard to get to. That's a fact.  Shot me in the back. I haven't... made you angry, have I? I s You have no idea how true that is. There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing off at ten paces. I do.  Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven. He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it, gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin. The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword still in his belly. Iwo Well, I'm known for that. The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back, unable to make a sound. Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we hear his arms crack. Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his sword, saying: If you're here to tell me we ain't finished... then we will be real quick. The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the ship, framed by the rain behind. 'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be long 'fore she rolls right over and falls back asleep. Taint my worry. That don't bode especially well for you... giving the order to let us go, patching up our hurt... You still standing there when the engine starts, you never will figure it out. The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.  What a whiner... Think she'll hold together? Make sure everything's secure. Could be bumpy. We're taking her out. Should be about a day's ride to get you back to your girls.  You ready to get off this heap and back to a civilized life? Good answer. He turns and heads into the bridge. You gonna ride shotgun, help me fly? V0 River is in the copilot's seat, looking intently at the screens and buttons. Think you can work out how to get her in the -- She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship hums to life. Okay, clearly some aptitude for the... but it ain't all buttons A0 and charts, . You know what the first rule of flying is? Well, I suppose you do, since you already know what I'm about to say. Love. You can learn all the math in the 'verse, but you take a boat in the air you don't love, she'll shake you off just as sure as the turning of worlds. Love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down, tells you she's hurting 'fore she keens. Makes her a home. River also looks out at the sky. We'll pass through it soon enough. What was that?"
margaret,LISA ,Anna Paquin," Thank you, Mr Aaron. She walks back. On her test he's written: B- ""SEE ME1"" Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean. A lot of people did. I mean I'll take it over again if you want, but like, what would be the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life... Um, no, not really. Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big difference-between using a book and like, I don't know, using somebody else's mind who's like, really good at math? It's not like this person did the whole test for me. No. I did some of it. She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back. You are so fair. Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an understanding about my math problem. Becky laughs. Lisa laughs. He is so appealing. A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE. Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a big fan of all the Presidents of the United States, especially the current one, but I still don't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt, because that just seems very general to me. Especially if you're going to judge them by the standard of -- whatever they're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably never existed to begin with. ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair. Oh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so much. Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go into Mathematics or anything...He was totally cool about it. He's so cool. What's that supposed to mean? I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat. Because my Dad is supposed to take me and my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to go horseback riding, and I don't think it would be right to appear on horseback in New Mexico without the appropriate equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You wouldn't understand these things. Anyway... Thanks again... Yes, Darren? I don't know. What do you mean, like on a date? All right. Calm down. What do you wanna see? OK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm sorry! Oh my God. Are you like -- are you asking me out?  Hello...? Earth to Darren. Oh my God... Nothing. This is -- Nothing. Wow. I mean -- I am really flattered. But I would definitely not want to do anything to mess up our friendship. It would definitely change it... Well...I would definitely have to think about this... OK, I will. Pause. He is looking at her like he wants something. Why do you look like that? What do you want from me? All right. I'll see you later. Hello...! Lisa drops her bag-and goes into the kitchen. She opens the refrigerator. Her brother CURTIS, 11, comes in. Is Mom home? Don't be such a little fuckin' goody two- shoes. - Please don't say ""fuck,"" Curtis. Yeah, that's because I know what it means. Uh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for it. It's when a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina and moves it around really fast until they both have an orgasm and he ejaculates sperm inside her body. Pause. Yes it is. No. I don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging me.  What are you up to tonight? . Nothing: Darren wants me to go to the movies with him. You want to come? I guess around eight? Hey! Where'd you get your cowboy hat? IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver can't hear her, but smiles at her with good-natured flirtatiousness. ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW. THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the light. THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas. He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa. She points at her head and then at him. He smiles, not quite getting it. The LIGHT turns RED. Still looking at Lisa, the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his head in a farewell salute as.-- LISA sees the bus pass under the RED LIGHT -- Ma'am, can you hear me? Can you hear me? My name is Lisa. No, you're not dead. You were in a traffic accident, but you're gonna be OK -- You were run over by a bus.  Are you kidding me! They're open. KID Well they're obviously I called them two minutes not coming fast enough ago, and somebody else so maybe you should probably called them too! call them again! Why not call them again! Sure! We can call her. What's her name? It's -- No -- that's my name. Is that your daughter's name?  I'm s -- I'm not trying to be confusing. My name is Lisa: Is that your daughter's name? I can't call her if you don't give me the number -- What's your daughter's number? Monica starts breathing a horrible rattling choking. Oh no please hang on. The ambulance is gonna be here any minute! Monica dies. Oh please hang on! Please hang on! NO ! Let GO. of me ! OK, sure. Yes. Thank you for the -- yes.  No, I wasn't on the corner. I mean I was, but I was running. I was trying to catch the bus. If that's what corner it is. Yes, except I wasn't standing I was running. No! I was already running! I was trying to catch the bus and I happened to pass the corner! I wasn't standing on the corner!  Yes! Yes! I was trying to catch the bus! I was trying to catch the bus! I understand! I don't mind, I'm just upset! Could somebody call my mother? Yes. Please stop patronizing me. They do make sense. Just ask me! I guess it was green? I didn't really see it. I think it was just an accident. Yes. Yes. I don't know. American history! Nothing: I saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus. She goes down the hall and into her room. JOAN, her mother, 40s, appears from the kitchen. Good one, Lisa. She starts breathing heavily. She goes into her bathroom -- Just a second...! Joan comes into the bathroom. Just a second! She throws up again. Just throw them out. I don't know. I guess she lived around here. She had all these Fairway grocery bags. I have no fucking idea. Oh, no thanks Mom. I mean thank you: That's really sweet. But I'm supposed to go see Becky anyway. I don't really want to sit here thinking about it all night. Go to work. I'll be alright. Joan doesn't look so sure. Hey. Did you get the tickets? Yeah... It wasn't very good. Who's that? Go out with him. Um, yeah...! Ramon disappears up the stairs. Joan and Lisa look at each other. She kisses and hugs Lisa, squashing her a little. Lisa gets a little tearful. Joan squeezes her tighter. 'Bye Mom. I love you too. Lisa goes out. We stay with Joan, who looks fretful. I didn't bring her as a bodyguard. NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 What are you muttering? Oh that whole family's crazy. NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Just everything. That's what I said.  So...I've been thinking about your suggestion... I guess I_don't think it's a very good idea. I guess I don't feel that way about you. Mom...?  Can I come in? Can I talk to you? How was the show...? Not really. Mom...I have to tell you something. So what do you think I should do? But don't you think I should say something to them now? Um, I think we have a pretty good idea how much people hate us now actually, Angie. They blew up our city, OK? So yeah, I think we have a pretty good idea, and personally I don't give a shit. There is some laughter from the class. -- because the people who blew up the World Trade Center were a bunch of sick monsters - Yes! No, because they killed three thousand people for no reason. But why are you defending somebody who murdered three thousand people! Oh give me a break! This is totally stupid. They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to throw acid in women's faces! Oh my God, no it's not! Yes. She just stepped out in the street? How are you? I'm OK. No, I was actually really thinking about doing that... School's OK. I'm kind of fucking up in geometry... But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious... Well, I am definitely following in your footsteps in that regard-How are you? Oh the same. They're all kind of the same. Thanks, Dad, I don't really go for the California type. Hard to argue with. I think I'll stop generalizing,now...! Bye Dad. It was OK. Silence. What do you want me to say? JOAN I thought it was OK! Nothing! You said it! Next time I'll lie! I won't! I still might do lights or something. But I'm not gonna make a fuckin' ass out of myself parading around in a play so I can ask everyone how great I was for three years afterwards like my fuck-ass mother. Did I tell you guys I saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus? Check out my boots. What are you talking about? Becky. Give me a break. Pause. Can we just go please? Fine. But this is totally stupid because we're both going to the same party. It's very hard to be cool under these circumstances. I'll try...! He gives her the spoon. She snorts it. You are so funny...!  So what do we do now? Paul...! What about your girlfriend? Oh, never mind... They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She pushes his hand away. Oh... No. He moves his hand back. She lets him. Hey... You know I really love you, right? I guess I'm not very consistent. Are you still mad at me about the test? .Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place. You know what I mean. Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver. Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door. I'd do that. Mr Aaron sighs a little. Um, a little. Where are you going? Why are you going to the opera? Uh, no thanks. I don't like that kind of singing. Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera singing. OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it. Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera! I did! And then you were like, ""Why not?"" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times! Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think. I guess you would. Withdrawn. Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here! No...! Because it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your point! Was that supposed to be an imitation of me? Well, for someone who's supposed to be a professional actress that's a pretty lame- ass impersonation of someone in your own family. Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause. I will if I have to. Pause. Yes. You're a big cunt. You just called me a cunt, Mom! Not really. Oh my God! Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly. Just stop whining about everything! It doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at all! You've been in a million plays, you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb play, I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon or who you're going out with this week -- But I don't care about any of this! It doesn't matter! Your boyfriend doesn't matter! Your play doesn't matter, except to you! I don't care about New Mexico, because to tell you the truth I'm probably not even going -- -- and you want to know something else, Mom? There are more important problems in Do whatever you want. I don't care! I know you don't. That's the problem. Hey, Paul. It's Lisa Cohen. OK.  What have you been up to? Sounds good... So...I was just thinking...This is gonna sound really queer, but...by any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like, take away my virginity? Really? God, I'm so flattered. Actually it's because of my deep passionate feelings for you, Paul. Well, my Mom just went out for the evening...Except my little brother's getting dropped off at some point, come to think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home.  It's 252 West 85th Street...  Hello? Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper. Not really. Well, I don't want to fail Humanities. No, probably not. Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like talking right now. Pause. Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in. Oh really? What did they say? That's original... TRACKING them as they come into the living room... So this is the living room. We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of these books, by the way. Some of them. Not all of them. Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich. Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now. Do you want anything to drink? OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener is. - Thanks. Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it. How come everything you say always sounds so ironic? You don't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like, totally ironic and funny. So...do you want to see my room? This is my room. Ta da. And these are my stuffed animals. These are some drawings I did...Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, right? Yeah, I just do it for fun. But I've always really liked it... He looks at her pictures. So...can I ask you a question? This is probably gonna sound very immature, but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what we're about to do? Or is it just like no big deal to you?  OK, that was a really stupid question and I'm like totally embarrassed right now. I'm actually more embarrassed than I've ever been in my life. If you want to go home now that's totally Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I think it's worth it: I usually get nervous because I can't help the way I feel. Although I do think that if anything is worth getting nervous about, it's this. But maybe that's just really idealistic of me. You are so funny...! Oh you can just chuck it out the window. Paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette. He closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her. Are we starting? And am I being really dorky right now? I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous. Please ignore. What are you like the nicest guy in the world? Like that? in I supposed to go really fast at the end or something? You don't have to do that. Don't do that, OK? I'm just embarrassed. Let me do it to you. Yeah. OK: You sound insane. They laugh. Ow! Kind of, yeah. Did you bring a condom? Shouldn't you put it on? This is really kind of hurting. I love you. Nothing. What? Did any of it get inside me? That's my little brother. She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS. Hi, Curtis. Hey.  Can I have a drag? (takes a drag of his cigarette) Thanks. I'm actually kind of mad at you... I guess so. Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you know? And I really don't want to have an abortion, because I know when you have one at my age it, can be really hard to get pregnant later on, and I definitely want to have children some day. Oh, the ""I'm A Total Fucking Moron"" Pill? Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure it's fine...Or not...! How do you know? Have you been tested? I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of my emotions.  Anyway...Thank you for deflowering me. Did it freak you out that I said I love you? You don't have to say it back, because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me. You should probably go now... That's my brother. Cue thirty-six, go. But I'm jealous of you... Because of everything! 'Cause you always get such good grades and your family never has to worry about money, and your parents are still together, and I'm really jealous of your other friends! Me too! They embrace tearfully. Many of the kids are moved. Some are not. Becky leaves Lisa in the circle. Lisa wipes her eyes. Darren...? Darren unglues himself from his perch on a table, and sits in the circle with her. I know that I'm not who you want me to be to you. And I know how much I've hurt you. But I still can't believe it means we can't be friends anymore! So much has been happening to me this semester -- I don't love anybody more than you! You're practically my best friend! Hi, my name-is Lisa Cohen. I was a witness in a bus accident case a few weeks ago... Well, this is probably gonna sound a little weird, but are you allowed to tell me how to get in touch with that woman's family? I'm obviously probably too late to go to the funeral, but I really wanted to send some flowers or something. Or is that like classified information? She mentioned she had a daughter... So did you have the trial, or whatever? Or did you make the -- did they have a ruling yet? No Criminality. Wow. That's a -- great system you got. OK. Wow. Yeah. Yes, I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz? Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me...I... Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling about your cousin, Monica Patterson? I was actually there when she had -- during the accident. I didn't know her, but I was the one who was with her when she died... Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the time... OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the paper, but I didn't see anything about a funeral. I assume they had one, because -- I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she said something about her daughter? Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask: Was her name Lisa? OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought -- Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to -- I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen? Oh so was she a lawyer? Were you really good friends with her? I'm going to that woman's funeral. Why? I don't even know her. Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me come. Oh -- Um -- no thanks. Oh - that's quite all right, thank you. Emily, thank you so much for letting me be here. Didn't she have any family? Yeah...  I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye.  Goodbye. No -- M A R E T T I .. What about Brooklyn? . Thank you. I don't know. I don't know. Sorry. I don't really have a lot to say. It seems pretty self-evident to me. Hi Dad. OK. How are you? That sounds pleasant. Well...there's this one guy I sort of had something going with. But he kind of has a girlfriend, so... I realize I'm incredibly enthralling... Don't forget mature. No...Don't worry. Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long- standing relationship... Well, I think he already knows I like him. .I think I might have spilled the beans on that one a little -- Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out the technique next time I see him. Actually, Dad? I definitely want to hear how things are with you in a minute, but I actually have something kind of serious I want to ask you about ...I'm kind of soliciting people I respect-for their views on this... . so do you think I should go back to the police, or what? You mean to protect myself before I go back? That's OK. Anyway, I guess I would just like to know later that I would have done the right thing by myself, if you see what I mean. Because I don't think I have so far. Hello? Mom? What's wrong?...Did you have a bad show? What time is it?. Joan starts coughing. Blood starts coming out with every cough, first a little, then a gruesome amount -- LISA WAKES UP -- breathing hard short breaths. The room is dark and quiet. She calms down and gets up. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. My name is Lisa Cohen. I was involved in the same accident that Mr Maretti was involved in a few weeks ago... Yeah...I was just wondering if I could talk to him fora minute. Is he home? Hi. I'm really sorry to bother you...We never met. My name is Lisa Cohen... Well...do you remember me? From the bus accident? Well, would it be OK if I talked to you for a minute? I'd just like to talk about the accident for a minute. I don't want anything, and I'm not here to do anything bad. I just wanted to talk to you about it. It's in the phone book. I was gonna call first... I'm sorry: Could I use your bathroom? Well ...If it's OK, I'd rather talk to Mr Maretti in private. OK. I hope this isn't going to insult you too much... .I was just wondering if you felt bad at all about what happened. Yeah. Yes! I'm upset about the accident! I'm very I just...Well, I just want you to know... Well... you probably already know, obviously, that I told-the police on the police report that I thought the whole, thing was an accident... Well -- I mean, I know you didn't do it on purpose. But it wasn't like... Well ...I mean ...We were looking at each other... Well ...Yeah ...I mean. . .not like... romantically or anything... OK, scratch that. 'Cause that's not even... relevant... OK. I can see the way this is. I am -- All right! Well...the way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat -- If you could just let me...! From my point of view, I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase I was looking for one... and you were kind of waving back...And I know the police already decided it was No Fault, or No Criminality or whatever they call it -- -- I guess partly because of what I told them. And I know I was distracting you, but -- I did see the bus go through the red light. And that's when it hit that woman. Only nobody said that to them. And I just wanted to like, acknowledge with you that that's what happened. No...Yes. But I wanted to ask about your -- You don't remember looking at me and waving at me? Mrs. Maretti comes out again. Well ...I think we both remember something different. I'm not trying to get you in trouble. So you're just gonna leave it? I'm not talking about bringing her back. .I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened. I know that. But I lied. Yes. And I can understand if you don't want to get in trouble, but.-- I can't help what other people saw -- I just know what I saw! Because -- when they were asking me what happened -- it seemed like you were kind of looking at me -- like we were saying to each other, ""Let's not say anything about what happened."" I can't prove that you were doing that -- Mrs Maretti comes back outside. No! And I am not blaming you for any of this! All I'm saying is that I didn't really tell the cops what happened, and I didn't want to go back without -- I just want to say what really happened. It was both our fault. It was both our fault. Maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen. Fine! It's -- um -- 212- 555 -- 0157. Why do you need it? I don't know why you're -- Maretti turns and goes in the house. Yes. I guess I was afraid. I didn't know what to do. I know it doesn't sound very impressive. My mother hasn't really been that helpful. I mean she's got a lot going on right now and she just hasn't been that interested, I guess. Her show is opening. She's in a play. Well, it's kind of a big deal for her. She has a really big part. I guess she's really worried about getting a bad review or something. No thanks. I think I can handle this part myself. He didn't do it on purpose. I will if you will.  Yes... Just a minute! No we can't forget it, because I can't take this anymore. What do you care what they say about you anyway? I do understand it, because we have this conversation every time! You're great in the play, you're a great actress, everybody thinks you're great, everything about you is great, you're really really pretty -- So let me just find the review and then we can both kill ourselves, OK? Yes. Let me read it.  OK, it's really good. Oh my God. Listen to this: "".. .but it is the frankly extraordinary Joan Kaplan who transforms the savage wit of David Holmes' acid comedy-drama into something approaching sheer luminosity..."" ""But don't be misled by her feather-light touch and expert comic timing. With the canny  bray... Yes. ""-- of an actor at the JOAN Top of Craft, Ms. Kaplan takes Top of Craft...? us on an emotional roller coaster that is both hilarious and heartbreaking, maddening and magical."" OK. This is the best review I've ever read. Oh my God you're a huge star. Can I make coffee now? Here come the offers. Um, yeah. Is Detective Mitchell here? Oh. Um -- I talked to him on Monday and he said he'd be here after three... Um, well, do you know when do you expect him? I was involved in an accident a few weeks And I filled out a report with Detective Mitchell, but wanted to amend the report, so I thought I should -- Well, there was something I didn't tell him, and I wanted to tell him, because -- Yes! Yes! I want to change my statement. Yes. Yes. I know. That's why I asked to see Detective Mitchell. Who said he'd be here now. Which he's not. So... No. Sorry. It was that woman Monica Patterson, who got run over by the bus, on Broadway -- it was in a lot of the newspapers... I assume it was. But part of the reason it's closed is because of my statement. And the statement I gave -- Yes. I mean -- I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean I personally closed the case, like, legally. I meant that what I said was probably instrumental in getting the case closed, because I was the -- Lisa Cohen. Don't call me honey, OK? Pause. Are you not gonna help me now that I said that? Lisa Cohen! I'm calm right now! No... Nothing. I don't know if you remember me... I'm Lisa Cohen. I called you on Monday? Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road. And I was definitely trying to get his attention... I don't have any control over if he goes to jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I just want to set the record straight, so that if he gets away with this I won't have been a part of it. Do whatever you want. I know what I did. Even if he kills someone?  So he's not liable to be prosecuted for manslaughter? Or second degree murder? That's unbelievable! What does he have to do? Kill her on purpose? No. Pause. You're kidding.  .Yeah, because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park. Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for. She exhales and hands Becky the joint. Hi John. Sorry. Hi, Mr Aaron...! I'm pretty damn good. How are you? Oh...I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime...(squinting at him in the sunshine) Hey, what kind of a bike is that? I'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering, does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle? But you must have ridden a lot of horses. Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or someplace like that? God, so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews? What's a Lisa question? About half and half. Before you go, I am actually thinking of getting one of these. Can I try it? Just for one second? Thanks. No thanks. This actually feels really, really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so easy to tease! She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward him, wobbling badly. I like your bicycle...! Can I have it? Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's not like I'd ever say anything if you ever deigned to like, you know, be with me. I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close. Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice you're still standing here. It's not my fault if I revere you as a god! Oh my God. I made you laugh. I am so happy right now. Oh -- no thanks. I'll order something. Yeah, did he say anything? I'd rather not talk about it when you have one foot out the door. I'll tell you later, if that's OK. She's the friend of the woman who died, the one who had the funeral... OK. How's Ramon? Give him a chance, Mom, you just met-the guy. You feel lonely when you're with him? I guess so. I feel that way all the time. You get used to it. So don't get serious. That's my advice. Pause. Have a good show. OK, great. Are you guys gonna order something? As opposed to what? I don't understand. I thought we were trying to get the police to arrest this guy...! Sorry. You can really sue for that? So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing? The bus driver? But do you think the driver would get fired? Even if all the facts came out at the trial? I'd say she was alive for ten minutes. Her leg was cut off. I'm sorry, Emily.  Yeah, awake. Why not? Can't I explain why I lied the first time? It's not like I'm trying to get any money for myself. So that's'something, isn't it? Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy -- No, its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus! I think she had a pretty good idea. Yes, Detective Mitchell please? . My name is Lisa Cohen? C 0 H -- Yes, I'll hold. Fuck you... Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling. Well, I was just wondering what ever happened, if anything, with the case. You said you might re-interview the bus driver... You did? What happened? But how did you ask the questions? He's obviously not gonna change his Yeah, not to white people. You don't do it to white people. Anyway, I'm not saying you -- Oh my God... Yes, thank you, yes. Yes, I would. So there's no way to appeal -- But how do you know Detective Mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you weren't there? Really? Why does this not shock me? This is making me sick. We do? Why not? Really. My God. What's with Monica and her cousin? So that's who we're getting the money for? Six years! So what good does that do? By getting money from their employers' insurance. companies? Could we insist they fire the driver? As part of the settlement? But is that something people do? And you think we're gonna win? They're gonna settle? This is -- Emily and Lisa take hands and squeeze. What'd I do now? I think about a thousand people must... Nothing... You should go see it, it's really good. She's just being modest. She's gonna win every award in New York. That show was so stupid. That's not true...! Yeah, I do. I'm not. My grades slipped a little. They'll get better. Anyone can do their homework. You just sit down and do it. I've been distracted. I'll stop. We didn't need to have a big conference about it. There's nothing to keep her apprised of., We're just waiting for them to schedule the Discovery conference. Mom? It really doesn't matter. I just wanted to...I was just there. Oh my God, is that you? God... So how old was she when she died? God. I can't even imagine. You know Monica asked about her when she was dying? She just asked if somebody could call her daughter. But then it got confusing because I said, ""Sure, what's her name?"" And she said her name was Lisa. And I said, ""No, that's my name."" Because it took me a minute -- I didn't realize we had the same name... Emily does not respond. But I couldn't tell if what I was saying But then when I found out her daughter was dead, ever since then I keep having this really strong feeling that some way, for those last five minutes I kind of was her daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the reason I was there: Like in some weird way, this obviously amazing woman got to see her daughter again for a few minutes, right before she died. I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body. I don't believe in all that stuff at all. Oh my God! Why are you so mad at me!? You think I'm making this into a dramatic situation because I think it's dramatic?!? What does that have to do with anything? If anything I think it means I care more than someone who's older! Because this kind of thing has never happened to me before! Yes it is! I know I'm not the one who was run over -- I'm well aware of that! Oh wow.  I am not -- Oh my God! I'm not fucking dramatizing anything! I was there, and you weren't! And if I happen to express myself a little hyperbolically, Emily, that's just the way I talk! I can't help it if my mother is an actress! Why are you being so fucking strident? Yeah. Why? Because I called you strident? No I'm not! You're insulting me enough as it is: You don't have to call me stupid too! OK! I will. OK! Let me get my purse! Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives her toward the door. Does this mean we're dropping the whole inquiry? All I meant by saying you were strident was that you were being emphatic! I obviously misused the word! Jesus Christ. You're amazing.  Why are you doing this... .! I never said or thought you were...! And I really didn't mean to call you strident! I But I'm not trying to dramatize anything, Emily. I really know about that trend, and I really don't think I've been doing that. I will. They kiss and make up, but it's still a little ugly. All right. Let me ask her. I was thinking about spending next year with Dad. Yeah. You're all "

watchmen,DAN ,Patrick Wilson," No way. We see who Hollis is speaking to--DAN DREIBERG (the second Nite Owl), late 30's, handsome, though he's let himself go the past few years--his edges have gone soft. He was in the photo of the new Watchmen in Blake's apartment. The Big Figure.  Wow, it's really late. Dan stands, finishes his beer. Hollis sees him to the door. That's bullshit, Hollis, and you know it. They hug. What? Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN No, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some up for you? You were on the news. They say you attacked a cop. Other than that . How have you been keeping? This little stain, is that bean juice or-- The Comedian? Nervous now, Dan glances out the window. DAN Let's talk downstairs. How did it happen? Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not have known who Blake was. You're right. I heard he was working for the government. Maybe it was a political killing. You don't think that's . a little paranoid? I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years, even amongst his friends, if he had any. The man wasn't exactly endearing. Just because something happened to him doesn't mean it involves us. I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've all been out. Except you. You know that. Yeah, thanks. You can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on Fleet street-- Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL. Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach. Great times.  What ever happened to them? I'm here to see Adrian Veidt. No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is here to see him. I understand, but if you would just tell Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, I'm an old friend. Just tell him I'm here. I assure you he'll see me. Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken. She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office. Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him-- it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns. You look good, Adrian. He did? Must've been tough to get past your security, even for him. I thought your assistant was going to take me out. You're the world's smartest man, Adrian. You tell me. Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling, ""punish me! punish me!"" Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter. It's great seeing you again, Laurie. You sure I can't get that? They've been watching the whole time? How is Jon, by the way? You're probably right. Uh, yeah. Awful. Yeah. I'd really like that. Laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan. As Dan watches the car drive off, TWO KIDS nearly bump into him, running around playing. The Kids make flying noises. Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp.nan Oh God. Comedian, this is a nightmare! The whole city is erupting! How long can we keep this up? Protection from what? Blake laughs, exultant in the blowing smoke, the chaos. Who is it? Laurie? It takes a few moments for him to open the door. Sorry, I had a new lock installed, it's a little sticky-- Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you here? I'm really sorry, Laurie. Not at all. I was just going to see Hollis for our weekly beer session. You're more than welcome to join. In fact, I insist They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless Man is arguing with the News Vendor: Laurie, will you please stop apologizing? I'm here for you anytime. SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following. Why don't you come by Hollis' with me? Shake off the adrenaline. I know, you won't believe it-- Wait, what? Dan turns to the TV, which replays the clip of Dr. Manhattan being accosted and then teleporting everyone to the roof. I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know. Jesus! Rorschach My new lock? Adrian, I need to talk to you. Adrian looks put off. But what about what happened with ion? Adrian excuses himself from his Assistant. Rorschach came to see me again. Maybe there's something to this mask killer thing. Adrian! BANG! The man SHOOTS the Assistant in the gut; Adrian immediately springs into action--he moves with unbelievable speed and quickness, grabbing a velvet ROPE-STANCHION-- --DEFLECTING A SECOND BULLET with it-- --and SMASHING IT INTO THE FACE OF THE ASSASSIN, knocking him into a FOUNTAIN. SECURITY GUARDS run, guns drawn, toward the fountain where Adrian GRAPPLES with the dazed man. Talking to the cops. Thank god he's still in great shape. You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he's as fast as I've ever seen him Listen, why don't you . how about you stay at my place? It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an extra room. We're friends. And with everything that's been happening I don't know. But it can't hurt to be safe. Besides, I've already had one wanted person visit me, another one won't make a difference. They look at each other. Laurie smiles. Some local low-life named Roy Chess Noon. Thought I'd let you sleep in. Laurie smiles at him. Is Dan crazy or does he sense a spark? She touches his shoulder as she turns into the living room, then turns on the TV: He wasn't always like that. We were a great team--tactically, he was brilliant. But I don't know, something about this murder charge I just can't see Rorschach shooting Moloch. Don't remind me, I made that thing for him. But a regular gun just seems too . ordinary Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer. Well, not to his face. Laurie laughs. Laurie?! Dan BOLTS for the basement door, thoughts of the mask-killer on his mind. Where are you?! Dan SPRAYS the fire. Laurie stumbles from the smoke, out of the Owl-Ship. Dan's got the fire under control now. I don't smoke. Are you hurt? Ah, that's mostly just soot. Archie's pretty resilient. Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon exiled; Someone tries to shoot Adrian; Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me uneasy. My Dad was in corporate banking. He left me quite a bit. Which always surprised me. Mugging. He was shot. As Dan cleans up, Laurie watches him, like she's seeing him for the first time. Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about you, I mean, we're, y'know, friends-- Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES him. It's what Dan's been wanting all this time . but he pulls away. Sorry, I Mask killers. War. Nuclear annihilation. I feel so powerless, so I've been afraid of this damn costume. Afraid of how much I need it. He FLINGS the owl wing crescent, whizzing into the dark. What? I can't believe it still fits. Luckily I constructed it with material that was elastic and-- Dan turns as Laurie appears at the door, decked in her BLACK SPANDEX. SILK SPECTRE, looking every bit as good as seventeen- --form fitting Me too. Let's have some cloud cover. Hang on. Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward the VELDT BUILDING. Got to clean her up a bit. I'm sure Adrian wouldn't want to impede the course of justice. Heading straight for the building, Dan JIGS at the last moment, flying the ship THROUGH THE V-SHAPED WATERFALL in the skyscraper's center. The water washes clean the years of dust. The Owl-Ship emerges, sparkling like new. I'm putting the water cannons on the lower stories. Yeah. He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He knows what he wants and this time he's not afraid of it He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they slide each other's masks off. Their mouths melt together. Yeah, saving those people from the fire. Taking Archie out Laurie swats him on the chest--that's not what she meant. Dan grins, having fun with her. It--you were unbelievable. They kiss. I've been thinking about that. And I believe we have certain obligations to our fraternity. Rorschach may be sick, but I think he's on to something--four heroes attacked in a week is not a coincidence. I mean, that whole cancer thing with ion, does that make sense to you? You didn't contract cancer from him. He says as Laurie's about to light a cigarette. She changes her mind. I don't know. But I know someone who might be able to help. Dan lands the Owl-Ship on the roof. You're leaving town? So you do believe Rorschach's theory. All the more reason we need to get to the bottom of this. Maybe we can get Jon to come back in the process and stop all this madness. Rorschach's been the only one investigating this from the start. Without him, we're starting at the beginning and we don't have that kind of time. We need your help, Adrian. Where are you going to go? You don't have to do this. I know the whole crimefighting thing wasn't necessarily your choice in life. Hmm, Rorschach gets locked up in here and suddenly there's a riot. I wonder if that's a coincidence. They descend toward the hell of TEAR-GAS, FIRE and VIOLENCE. The Tower Guards, stunned at the sight of the Owl-Ship, begin SHOOTING at it. The bullets bounce right off. Put your ear-plugs in. When he and I were partners, we each had tracking implants put under our skin so old Archie here could find us if either one of us were ever in trouble. Let's see if Rorschach kept his in. Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There's a BLIP on the screen. He's in that wing. Dan steers the ship toward the Maximum Security Wing. 9 He's alive. Rorschach? Rorschach! Hey, it happens. I remember I lost a big arrest like that once. Had to redesign the costume after that-- Rorschach exits the bathroom, wiping his hands. Hey! Survive now! Argue later! I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire. The owl-Ship rises to the roof. They all jump in. Rorschach, you remember how to handle Archie? Give us a second-- What? What is it Dan looks up, through the windshield, and sees-- --Dr. Manhattan WALKING ACROSS THE CLOUDS--STRAIGHT FOR THE Wait, what? You're taking her to Mars? No, she can't--Laurie, I don't know about Let's try and lose them in the city. He hits the jets, heading for the New York SKYLINE. oh no. I know-- They head straight for the subway-- --when the tunnel opens up-- --Dan SWERVES to the adjacent track just in time. Shit. Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around the skyscrapers, the Empire State Building . but the copter's still there. Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter follows the Owl-Ship around to the East River . but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to be found The copter hovers there. Baffled. Hey! We took enough unnecessary risks bringing Archie up so you could get your spare costume. We stay put until it cools down out there--they're looking for us. I know, you told me already. I'm tapping into all the databases, finding out about the company-- Listen, I HAVE HAD IT! Who the hell do you think you are? You live off people while insulting them, and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic! Dan turns away, shaking. He leans against the console. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Maybe you're right, maybe-- Hey forget it It's okay, man. Releasing his hand with some effort, Dan sits, invigorated. You're right. It's time to head up. Let's really start plumbing the depths. Positive. Pyramid Industries. Specializes in industrial plastics. At least they did. I tapped into all the databases--tax records, business registries, real estate records--trying to get a bead on who's behind Pyramid but it's a never ending paper trail. Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT-- --he turns his FLASHLIGHT to find a few HOMELESS PEOPLE squatting in the warehouse. Upon seeing Dan in.costume, the Homeless People run away. They're harmless, Rorschach. Hey, I know this man. No I didn't watch that interview. This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him. Rorschach. What, what if it's Adrian? On the surface it doesn't, but hear me out--Adrian's the only one who could've taken on the Comedian in hand to hand combat. He's the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan. And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast. He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list. If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he could've had the hitman shoot his assistant first. It was a risk, but-- I don't know. Let's go ask him. Something I can help you with, boys? They all spin around, frightened at the costume. What old guy? You're dead! You and the rest of your gang, you're all DEAD! You know how much fire-power I've got floating out there!? Oh god damn. Hollis. God damn god damn god damn Dan begins to break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away. I've got a large reading ahead. Anything that's emitting that much heat out here, must be a pretty big facility. Adrian. They're icing up, hold on! Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD. We just lost the engines--find something to grab on to! The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT. The engines are de-icing. You sure I can't fit you with something warmer? Adrian, don't make me-- Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with the tray-- --then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan's NOSE. Blood SPRAYS, Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm. You know! You killed the Comedian! You set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid Industries, hired all those people, gave them cancer and blamed it on Jon! Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do? Why take that risk? What if the hitman shot you first instead of your assistant? Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to do? Three million people? You're joking. Rorschach, he's making it up! By killing millions of people? And when were you planning on doing this? God. God, he By committing the biggest mass murder in history. You have no right to play God! Jon, stop him, he killed millions of people, who knows what else he'll do. Jon walks calmly after Adrian. Jon, are you okay? You seem drugged. What? Where's Laurie? Laurie, shoot him again! Adrian's hand falls from his chest to the floor, blood trickling, as his PALM OPENS-- --holding a BULLET inside. LAURIE! If you've hurt her, I'll-- He's right. All we did was fail to stop him from saving Earth. Rorschach, wait a second! Let's talk this out! Rorschach! Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the exit. Your death. Yeah. You might have created peace, but not at the expense of justice. You need to pay for what you've done. Exactly. Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV screens. Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't. Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life. His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About justice. About life. But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily. Really? I've always liked owls Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt. Adrian STEPS on Dan's WRIST, bones crunching. Dan's HAND falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP REMOTE. because you can never hear them coming. BEHIND ADRIAN: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian as the OWL- SHIP CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and into Adrian and Dan. Silence, but for the tinkling of GLASS falling to the floor. Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered. Most of Adrian has been CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a fine blood spray. Adrian looks over to Dan, dying. So do I. Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies. That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick to the left The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out more glass. Now, the thrusters . There. She HITS THE THRUSTERS. The ship FLIES from the control room. It's afterburners IGNITING the room, and Adrian's body. Oh hi. There are always bad guys. Even in today's world. Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York skyline being rebuilt. Hmm? As long as no-one ever finds out that Adrian was behind it all, the public will think ion is still up there, watching. The threat remains, and everything should be fine."
charade,REGGIE ,Nah," Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie! Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche? Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce. He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but -- I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable. Because I don't love him.  I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,  It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank? Why, do you think we're going to? I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else. Quitter. You give up awfully easy, don't you? I'm afraid you're blocking my view. The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name? I'm Regina Lampert. Yes. No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce. No, you see, I don't really love him. Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore. Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is. Is there a Mrs. Joshua? That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious. Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete? Now you're angry. Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: ""When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again""? How do you know? Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me? Charles is. Lord, I hope so. Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks. (She turns toward the house)  Don't you want me to stay? -- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?  Merci. Wonderful. Honorine -- ! Charles -- ! Yes. I'm very cold. Leave?  I'm very confused. Swiss. He didn't have one. I don't know. I suppose so. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I know.  I'm sorry. I wish you wouldn't. I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.  A letter? May I see it?  ""My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed.""  Not very much, is it? Did you?  Is that all? Can I go now? Of course it is. I don't understand.  It's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now.  What are you doing here? How did you find out? Thank you. Yes it is -- I heard it this morning. They must have turned off the electricity. Charles sold it all -- at auction. Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose. I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him. Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail. I don't know where to go. Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore. I loved this room -- but Charles never saw it -- only what was in it. All those exquisite things --  I think I prefer it like this. It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out. Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him. Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that. I've never seen him before. How can you tell? Yes? I don't understa-- Merci, Monsieur. The American Embassy. I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.  Hello -- ?  Hello? Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here. Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert. Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am? No thanks. I don't suppose it's an airline, is it? You mean spies and things like that? We? You mean you're --? I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit -- Agent. What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew? May I have a sandwich, please?  So that was it.  His -- real -- ? Very sweet. Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license. It's Charles! He looks so young -- when was this taken? It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie. No. Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one. No. That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too -- No, thank heaven. Danger? Why should I be in any danger? Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! (she takes another sandwich) Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me. But it's Charles's money, not theirs. Then whose is it? His or theirs?  Oh, I see. But I don't have it. I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth. Thanks very much. Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it. You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash? But -- Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you? Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it! Why not? Oh.  Hallo, Peter. I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing. Don't you understand French? The man and the woman are married -- That's the policeman -- he wants to arrest Judy for killing Punch. That she's innocent -- she didn't do it. I believe her. Punch, of course. He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?  Starting tonight? Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow. No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti! Lay on, MacDuff. What do you want? Tell me what? I don't know anything. Leave me alone -- ! Stop it! He -- he was stepping on my foot.  Wait for me -- I won't be long.  Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew: I've seen one of the  Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me? Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Regina Lam... Wha -- what do you want? No -- no, I'm don't. I don't know what -- What are you doing? Stop that! Please stop -- please! You're insane, absolutely insane!  Having a nervous breakdown. I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not. He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me. That's what I'm not supposed to say. Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me. Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime. Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s'il vous plait.  Would you mind seeing me to the door? This is quite a place for making friends, isn't it?  How do you shave in there? What was what? Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a -- Where? How about once more around the park?  Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.' How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child. Do you know what's wrong with you? Nothing. Good night.  I don't know -- I don't know! I don't --  Peter -- ! Peter -- ! A man -- he tried to kill me!  Peter -- ?  Peter! Where are you? Peter -- are you all right? Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him. Be careful, Peter. Who is it? There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them. A quarter of a million dollars. That's all. I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train. But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.  Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust. I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet. Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies? Do you tell lies?  Hello?  What do you want?  The man you had the fight with. Who?  Yes -- that's right. He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me. I believe what he said. How do you know what they're doing? What are you talking about?  Words can hurt very much. Don't put yourself out. Yes, I'll remember. Good night.  -- But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew -- what I called to tell you was there's someone else -- someone who wasn't in that photograph you showed me. He says his name is Peter Joshua -- but it isn't -- it's Dyle.  Mr. Bartholomew? -- are you still there?  You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!  Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there. Taxi -- ! N'importe o -- vite! Allez-y!  Aux Halles -- vite!  What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew? Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies. He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it. Dyle, or whatever his name is. He's hardly my Mr. Dyle. Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really. No, what?  Carson? You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me? It's just lucky that I'm not hanging next to one of those things right now. Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle? Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about. Barely, yes.  They always do that. Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge. Can I at least keep the onion soup?  La soupe tout simplement.  Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground -- Steal it how?  May I have a cigarette, please? I hate these things -- it's like drinking coffee through a veil. Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened then? Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then? Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew. But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them? But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.? I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight. Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country. Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do? Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive. But no one actually saw him die. Oh. Then who's this one? Me? Why me?  Agents.  What are you doing, following me? Stop it -- we're going to look like a parade.  How are you? When did you arrive in town? Are you enjoying Paris? It's lovely, isn't it? So many wonderful things to see and do, it makes one's head spin to think of it. If you don't stop following me I'll call the police. Taxi -- ! Good morning, Mr. Dyle. It's the only name I've got. How about you? Why you lied to me. Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are. Carson Dyle is dead. Your -- How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ? Is that you? Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- (seeing his injured back) What happened? Scobie? Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy. Take off your shirt and lie down. It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you? Does it hurt? Are you really Carson Dyle's brother? Your passport! What kind of a proof is that? Sure. Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days. Is there a Mrs. Dyle? I thought that was Peter Joshua.  There -- you're a new man. Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not? There must be some way. Why couldn't you just look at his feet? Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.  Which one are you? Come here. Sit down. I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee. Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. I'm not fifteen. Why can't you be serious? Said what? Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?  Okay. Cutting it out. You did. Oh. (She starts kissing him again) I think I love you, Alex -- Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.  Sorry -- I was just -- uh -- nibbling on something.  Can you give me one good reason why I should? They've got Jean-Louis!  I'll be right there. What day is it? Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they? Jean-Louis! I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic. But his mother -- Scobie -- he's the one that objected. Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.  What should we give him? -- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly. Just hurry up and get here. Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it? Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden. Voil what? You know something, cookie? Why not? I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy. If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy. No. No, Jean-Louis. It's nothing, I tell you! Where is he? It's done in America all the time. Who do you think did it -- Gideon? Or Tex? You're a big help. Can I have one of those?  Vanille-chocolat. I think Tex did it. Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect. What's so illogical about that? Oh. I guess they just can't help it. Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that? No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some? I'm sorry. Alex -- I'm scared. No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed. What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too. First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that? No -- -- swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love -- like Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'? Hurry up and change -- I'm starved. It's the house detective -- why haven't you got a girl in there? Can I come in? Wouldn't it be better if you did it in my room? I wouldn't want to use that tub. Besides, I don't want to be alone. I'm afraid. Got you. The shower's in there. This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower. I dare you.  What are you doing? Shut the door! What on earth are you doing? How often do you go through this little ritual? I don't believe it.  Yes -- ?  Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.  Are you sure there's no mistake? Do you mind if we go someplace crowded? I -- I feel like lots of people tonight. I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me? How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it. But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so? It's a start, anyway. Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.  I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings. Fiction or non-fiction? Well! Go on. I suppose all this is leading somewhere? What do you mean?  You mean, you're a thief? I don't believe it. But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua. Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more. No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face -- -- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is. Is there a Mrs. Canfield?  I could eat a horse. Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on -- All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money. Oh! No -- I guess not. What? What about it? I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?  Adam! You don't look so bad in this light.  I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out. Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day? Aren't you allowed to kiss back? Well -- come on. I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you. I was, too.  No -- in my room. You're going to look for him -- now? Adam -- What is it? Why? I've looked, Adam -- you know I have -- Lord, you're stubborn. But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it. Lord, you're stubborn. Yes, but what? To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly. I'll bet you don't really need those. You need them. The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it? Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.  I love you, Adam. No -- last time I said ""I love you, Alex."" I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now. Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain. No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam? It's the receipt Inspector Grandpierre gave me -- for Charles's things. I don't see how that's going to -- You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important. Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed. I think it only said where -- but I can't -- That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law. Of course there is! Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't -- (hearing something through her earpiece) Hold it. I'm on.  Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my distinguished colleague from Great Britain -- as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- lyses! Adam -- that was it! The garden! Now what? But Charles' appointment was last week, not -- Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job. It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for. Tex? You mean he's here, too?  Be careful, Adam -- please. He's already killed three men. Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?  What's he up to? I'm glad. But what's all this?  Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him! Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune! A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him! I don't see him. Jean-Louis! Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! (spotting the sack of stamps) What's that? Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where? I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives? Monsieur Flix -- ?  Yes. I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps. How much is it worth? I'm afraid it is important. Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one? What's its value today? In money.  Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one? And the last one?  You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?  Here's ten. Please keep it. I'm -- I'm sorry. Adam? Adam? It's me, Reggie -- !  Dyle --  Hello -- Balzac 30-04, s'il vous plait --  Mr. Bartholomew! Thank God you're there! Tex is dead, Mr. Bartholomew -- smothered -- and Adam did it -- he killed them all!  The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!  No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.  Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye. Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it! But Tex didn't -- he still thought --  Palais Royal -- vite! Mais c'est trs vite! On veut me teur!  Come on -- please --  Balzac 3 - 0 - 0 - 4. Embassies -- embassies -- Shh. (into the phone, whispering) American Embassy? Mr. Bartholomew's office, please -- Mr. Bartholomew's office --  No, I can't speak any louder -- Hamilton Bartholomew -- B as in -- uh -- Bartholomew -- that's right, and the rest as in Bartholomew!  But someone's trying to kill me -- you've got to send word to him -- in the center garden of the Palais Royal, by the colonnade -- tell him I'm trapped in a phone booth, below him in the Mtro station. And my name's Lampert. I'm through listening to you! Then who did? You're the only one left. No! Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me!  Carson -- ?  He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy. I don't know who anybody is any more! You lied to me so many times -- Can I really believe you this time, Adam? All right, Adam. But I didn't have anything to do with -- Wait, please! I need some time to think! Adam -- please! You didn't have to chase me so hard -- That one's done -- start on this one. I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are? The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps? All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps. I said, tell me to go to the -- Then say it. Never mind -- I'll go by myself.  Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay taxes.  Excuse me, soldier -- Forgive me. Whom would I see regarding the return of stolen Government money? Cruikshank, 216. Thank you, Marine. Mr. Cruikshank, please -- my name is Lampert. Mrs.  Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked -- You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?  Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway? Around one. Then how do I know this is your office? Bartholomew? Starting with his own. What's your first name today? Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one. Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank? But you're -- divorced?  Oh. Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank. Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now! You'd lie about anything. You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to -- (the coin drops into the slot) marriage license! Did you say -- ? You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you."
burlesque,ALI ,Christina Aguilera," Uh, excuse me? You forgot something. He turns. Sees: ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on her hip. Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts, white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young -- 22 -- but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age. Huh. See, now that's interesting -- you and I must do math completely differently, cause me? I start with the six beers I brought you, add the four spills I cleaned up, the five times I refilled your peanuts, plus the three times you ""accidentally"" touched my ass, then I tack on lying to your wife when she called looking for you, twice, and I come up with a sum that's a hell of a lot more than twenty-five cents. Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA -- 30's wearing every one of those years hard. Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an insult. There's only one thing a quarter is good for. Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room, passing a GEEZER who's sitting by himself, drinking alone. Dwight isn't here. Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine. Tough. I'm not working here for the tips Loretta. She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song. She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats, starts singing ETTA JAMES'S ""SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME"". Loretta-- when I get out of this butt-hole of a town, I sure as shit won't be heading for Des Moines. She hops up onto the bar, spins around on her butt, one leg up in the air like a Varga girl, then hops down on the other side then gets back to work. Nanna? Got your pot roast here! They were out of steak fries, so I got you some of those... Then she stops in her tracks. Nanna -- 80's, housecoat, oxygen tank -- is slumped in her chair. The TV remote is on the floor. ""ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT"" is blaring. Nanna? Arlene. She's Arlene. I'm Alison. No, she was good to me. She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up. And she wasn't even my real Nanna. Foster care. She took me in for the checks. When I turned eighteen, the money stopped coming. She could've kicked me out, but she didn't. She had a lot of pain at the end. Nothing she talked about, but I could tell.  Yeah. I guess she is. I had a death in the family. I'm not here to work. I'm leaving. Yeah. But, I won't be here then. And you owe me for three weeks. You know what, Dwight? Contrary to what you've been told, there's no law in Grundy that says you have to spend every waking minute being a tight-fisted, cheap-ass prick -- I've spent three years of my life I'm only taking what he owes me. Somewhere I can breathe. Now gimme a hug, I gotta get out of here before he gets back. Loretta hugs her tight, then looks Ali in the eye, concerned. How much to Los Angeles? You're kidding, right? Okay! Oh, hang on. She digs into her purse. All she has is twenties. She peels one off and holds it out. If I could just get a little -- But before she can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves, closing the door behind him. To the closed door: -- change. She pulls open the blinds, they fall off the wall with a CRASH! Ali stares at them. Then she opens the window. The SOUNDS OF HOLLYWOOD pour in. She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then she reconsiders. Hey. I thought this was a single. The cat curls up next to her. She checks his junk. Typical. First guy I meet is neutered. Singer/Actress... Singer/Songwriter .Singer/Scuba diver? Perfect. ON ANOTHER AD: It says: ""SINGER/WAITRESS WANTED."" MUSIC UP: I can dance. Sorry, you're just -- so DAMN beautiful. That you're a dude. Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali sees the mistake she made. She's mortified. Oh, shit. I'm really sor-- The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads. Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer. She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A. HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their elaborate costumes and provocative poses. She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool music emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She ventures inside... What is this place? A strip club? Only if you're buying. Not brand new. But still under warranty. Iowa. I thought you looked familiar. He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She doesn't notice. He barks at her: Hell no. I wouldn't have left. She stares up at the stage, marvels at the dancers. So tell me -- who does a girl flirt with to get from here...  to there? With someone wearing more eyeliner than me? He laughs. Points across the club to A DOOR leading backstage. Thanks, Jack. She smiles, slips it in her cleavage and heads for the door. Excuse me. I'm looking for Tess. Hi. I'm a friend of Jack's, and I'm- Yes, and I'm-- Yes, and I-- Yes. Tess glances at Ali in the mirror. Then goes back to her mascara, unimpressed. Silence. I'm a singer. A good one. I can dance. I'm a quick study. Okay, I get that you're busy so I won't waste any more of your time-- but this place-- I've just never seen anything like it before and I know I belong here. So, how can I be a part of it? One Dewar's neat, one shot of Patron, and get this, tough-guy in the hat? He wants a Cosmo. Jack looks at her, surprised. Impressed. One night. If I'm not 20 times better than boobs-for-brains over there, you don't have to pay me. Her leg went behind her head! I want to do that. When he kisses me I get a thrill... The Cat MEOWS and slinks out from behind the bed. Ali pulls the crystal beads out of her pocket And when he does that wiggle I can't keep still (ties the beads around the Thanks. She heads back to the bar. As Jack loads her tray up, she stuffs her tips into her pocket-- SEES Sean, looking her up and down. And you are? So Asshole's a regular? He's with Nikki? Who's that with him? She's funny. Hey, no, that's for -- Nikki opens a bottle, pops 3 pills in her mouth, washes them down with the drink, and sets the empty glass on Ali's tray. You, I guess. Nikki turns to the mirror and starts getting to work. As Ali hands out the other drinks: Tess? Do you have a second? Tess doesn't answer. But a slight glance at Ali in the mirror shows she's half-listening. I was thinking -- see, I grew up listening to all this music, I'd play the records over and over -- Now see-- that's what I've been thinking about. There's one thing I don't get. It's the vocals. You have the girls lip-synching. which is fine, I guess, but wouldn't it be so much better if they actually sang? The Girls trade looks, knowing Ali's overstepping here. Ali doesn't feel the vibe-shift, surges ahead. I've been reading up on it, and back when burlesque started, that's what they did. Silence. Nobody moves. All eyes on Tess.  Oh. Well... this book said it came after... Oh. Ok. It's just-- It's just that ...I CAN sing and-- Georgia? You okay in there? A FLUSH. The stall door opens. Georgia comes out shakily with mascara-smudged eyes, sweet as ever. There aren't many women who could dance the Charleston on a chair at - - what are you, three months? Georgia turns sideways to the mirror, inspecting her bump. You haven't told him? You look pretty hot to me. Georgia reaches into her corset, yanks one breast skyward, then does the same to the other. I had to pee. Is that okay with you? Hey! They tear past her. She shakes her head, reaches her landing, heads down the hall toward her room, then sees: HER HOTEL ROOM DOOR, ajar. The lock broken. No. No! She runs down the hall. No!!! God damn it!!! She looks out the window, SEES the ROBBERS running off, disappearing down the street. She kicks the trash can. It flies across the room. Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it! She sees the cat watching her from behind the bed. A lotta help you were. The cat creeps out, slinks around her legs. Ali plunks on the bed. Shit. Then she sees, on the floor, the PHOTO she took from Nanna's. She picks it up. The glass has cracked, tearing the picture.  Came in -- busted the lock-- and stole all my MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!! She sobs--trying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS only heard by birds. Jack winces, trying to follow--  And there's no way I-- sleep there-- with-- like that-- the manager said- - not till Monday-- and I don't-- anyone else-- but then-- so I remembered I had...but it went straight to...so I... She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a card. It's Jack's that he gave her in the club. It has his address on it. I can't. I.. .don't ...have anyone. To call. Just for one night, I swear. Just till it's light outside and I can figure out my next move. What? You don't like cats? It slinks around his leg. He shakes it off. How can you hate a cat? He goes outside. We just have to open a window. He's very independent. She opens the window. The cat scurries back in, leaps onto the ledge. Ali pets him. Looks at Jack, smiles. I don't have a name for him yet. It purrs. Jack eyes it warily. One night. You're good. Why don't you play at the club? You in a band? Hey... He stops playing again. Why'd you leave Kentucky? Cause I looked around and realized there wasn't one person whose life I wanted. Hey Jack? He stops again. Thank you. I'm really glad I'm not alone tonight. He smiles. Morning. Coffee? She's pretty. Your sister? Fiancee? You're straight? Yes? I don't know, the...make-up? Okay. Okay. I should put on pants. Where is she? For how long? I don't know. Now that you're straight and engaged, it feels weird that I came here. Alrighty then-- I'll get outta your hair now... Oh, don't worry about me. I've got a plan.  Come on, cat. She zips the cat into the bag he came in. No, I'm good, if you could just She nods at the door. He opens it for her. Thank you. For everything. You are my knight in shining... eyeliner.  I'll see you at the club. .was to sit here at the bus stop and come up with a plan. No, Jack, I-- I'll figure it out, this is not It's only water for chrissakes-- Jack-- you've done enough and-- In ONE MOVE he SCOOPS HER up as she lets out a WHOOOOP! Jack-- No! Stop it! He grabs her bags and carries her back across the street-- You really don't need to do that. I'll be fine -- Trying out. Tess, I've been singing and dancing my whole life and--  Hey_. This is your club and you can be as rude as you want--but don't you dare tell me I'm not serious. Sean's eyebrows reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES Ali on stage. I may not have been to a professional dance school, but I have a lot of talent and I came to this town to do something with it. And the only reason I've been putting up with all the bullshit ""attitude"" I get from you is cause I want to do it here. One song. You don't like it, I'll quit and do us both a favor. Which one do you wanna see? Tess looks at her in disbelief. I said, which one do you wanna see? Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to DAVE in the sound booth-- Hang on.  Start it again, please? As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down and shakes it loose. Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage-- Anytime. The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive. She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She misses a step or two, but who the hell cares? On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced. Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow. At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms - - unable to tear his eyes away. So, I was spot on the first half? Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and RUNS to the bathroom to puke-- Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali. Do I have the job, or not? And I know all the routines. As Tess turns and leaves-- Hey, I happen to like the way I look. Sorry for the short notice, I quit!  But hey-- with my raise I'll be off your couch in a week. She squeezes him tight-- then heads backstage leaving him standing there, really turned on. My tits are up around my ears, my thong's about a mile up up ass, this corset is so tight, I haven't breathed since Tuesday and these lashes are thick enough to kick up a stiff wind. Hey. All the girls went out for pizza. Apparently not. Tess reads her like a book. Knows what went down. She turns to leave, then pauses at the door. Turns back. What...?  You closed the window, what do you expect? Awwww. Poor guy, you must have been desperate. Okay, Jack-- I get it-- His cell phone rings. As he checks who's calling: Guest studio, Hollywood, $900, with a yard, and -- oh. No pets.  Screw them. She scans the ads some more. Finds a good one. Ooh? Jack walks in. Looks like he's got something on his mind. I think I found my new place. Where's Pomona? Really. How's Beachwood Canyon? What about the ""God damn"" cat? Ah-hah. Save your ass? Well, will you look at that? The shoe, on the other foot! One minute I'm a freeloader with a God damn cat, the next, I'm the only thing standing between you and What's the proposal, exactly? Jack looks at her-- realizes he's screwed. Closet? Ooh, look! Hot tub! Okay. But, wait-- Tess-- that's always been Nikki's number. Tess looks at her-- she's really had it with these girls-- Tess, when the music stopped-- I did. Tess spots a TATTOOED BAND GUY in the door. You can't learn to sing like that. I just got into the show and suddenly I'm too good for it? Shrugs, ""but, you are"" then-- Sure. Jack's at the bar. Tell him I sent you. It's on me. Talk about a ""line."" She smiles, amused, and heads away from him, toward the bar. He watches her go. Tess intercepts Ali. Directions to the bar. As Ali heads off. Tess glances back at Marcus, mistrustful. I don't know, I can't explain it. It's like -- I start singing, and something starts to move inside me. It's in my hands, my feet, my gut, and it just builds and builds till I feel like I'm gonna explode. Yeah. Lemme get my bag. Ali moves off. Coco goes to get her coat. Sean sees Jack still watching Ali as she walks across the room. What? Where have I been all my life? Hiya, big boy. She spins herself around on a bar stool, so he can see all angles. Jack likes plenty. Way too much. What do you think? Jack. It's okay for you to think I look hot. We're friends for chrissakes. It's not like we're brother and sister. Beautiful. You write that? Jack? Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it. In here! Can you zip me up? In a nanosecond-- Jack enters the bedroom. Hey. Where you been? Me and my mom on my 7th birthday. She died just a few weeks later. 24. There was so much she never got to do. Sometimes I feel like, if I make the most of my life, part of her will get to live a little more, too. Every single day, something happens I want to tell her about. Don't know. Hasn't happened yet. They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it. His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes, feeling his fingers against her neck. Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable to look away. Until: His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali. Hey -- when can you cut out? I'm about to fall asleep standing up. No, that's okay, you go. I'll grab a ride with Coco. He grabs his jacket from under the bar. As he heads out:  Thanks. For what? Excuse me?  Talk to me about...? Hey...! Come back here...! Where are you taking me? Dinner? What about Nikki-- What's up with you and Nikki? Where I'm from friends don't chew each other's earlobes. What? You just remembered. And if I do. Wow. Nice house. Marcus -- you can't just take that. They're gonna throw us out of here. Ooh. Killer shoes. Hey, I saw them first. He laughs as they reach the top of the stairs and a BREATHTAKING PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE CITY is revealed. Ali pauses, taking in the glittering, massive view of L.A. Whoa. L.A. looks one hell of a lot prettier from up here. You own that too? There is nothing above it. You own...air? Aren't you the sly puss. What's the first? He gazes at her. She rolls her eyes. How many girls have you used that on? Why? I want to be the best singer I can be. I want to give as much joy as I get when I perform. And I want to die knowing I made the most of every opportunity life gave me. Oh, please. You are SO not a nice boy. He clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy. Ooh, I love this song. The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He starts humming along. She does too. Then he sings a line. She sings one back. And they fall in together. Not vamping, not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the music in the middle of the night. Ahh. My Nanna used to call me her Ali-Cat. I got a ride home with that guy-- Marcus-- we went to a party. It was fun. Yeah. Turns out he's not so bad. She heads past him, toward the kitchen. He notices: So what if I'm getting a little male attention. Not from anyone who matters. What? Ali wanders out of the bathroom, brushing her teeth. He shows her the paper. She SCREAMS. I'm starting to think you'll go to any length. Well-- I appreciate the kudos.  And Tess appreciates the business. You are so full of it. He laughs-- takes her arm-- Thank you. Not yet. Holy shit. Harold Saint. AT THE BAR, Jack watches Ali and Marcus talking excitedly. Not liking what he sees. Sean breezes by, grabs a drink. You really need to do that at 6 in the morning? He turns, sees her. My pajamas were in my bedroom. Which was occupied. So -- you want the bedroom back? Is that what you're saying? Hey, I'm home every night. Maybe not when you think I should be, but last I checked, you were my roommate, not my mother. However, since it's an issue, what the hell, take the bed, I'll sleep on the sofa. I don't care. Fine. I realize that. I'll move my stuff, God -- Jesus, Jack, what is your problem? Ever since I started hanging out with Marcus, you've been acting like a class-A prick. Is there something you want to say? First of all: He's not the devil. He's a smart businessman. And oddly enough-- a gentleman. Lookin' kinda lonely. Hey-- what're we, in junior high? Well, you're quite the crooner. He looks her in the eye. You and Natalie split up? Do I look alone to you? They share a look. Then he spins her around in his arms. She laughs. AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is watching the DJ spin. The DJ glances down at them. Whoopsie daisy -- PULL BACK to find Jack and Ali, drunk, staring at the keys on the ground. My Nanna used to say that all the time. That and upsie jumpsie. When she wanted her dog to get on the bed with her. That is -- Help me. Jack gets the lamp to standing, then grabs one of Ali's boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the second -- it sticks -- he pulls harder -- the boot pops off and he careens backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over again. Ali cracks up. He turns to the lamp. Oh. Okay. Cute jammies. Go figure. Jack walks past Ali, toward the door. Night again. He walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door. Ali smiles to herself, plumps her pillow. The door flies open again -- Jack's there in just the pants, no top. What? Well, it's official. You are definitely not gay. He smiles at her, drunk with lust. CAMERA PANS UP AND OFF OF Sure got a funny way of showing it. He smiles at her. So, what about Natalie...? Natalie? Jack scrambles for something to put on.  What 's she doing here: What?!? Fine, I'm out of here--  You said you split up! So am I. She gathers up more things, really pissed-- Oh. I'm sorry. I think I have the wrong apartment. I'm looking for Sean?  Brown hair? 5'10n? Early 30's? Long story. Sean notices the guy in the blanket. I'll make it. You two get acquainted. Oh. Marcus. Mark. Or Mike. Jury's still out. Only if you had your eye on Sean. Mmm. Maybe a little. What's that? Haven't you heard? No is the new yes. She was a poet. What new place? Marcus, I can't just-- It's not even on the bus route. Yeah, right. Really? What'd he say? Are you serious? When?? This Tuesday? No! Oh my god, no, that's amazing. You're amazing. I think you're way too nice to me. I've had a lot to drink. And my judgment is off. He touches her face, their chemistry palpable. Liar. She leans in and impulsively pulls him into a kiss. Where am I? She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF MARCUS on the wall. She raises her brows then sees her disheveled reflection in a huge mirror: smeared mascara, hair askew. Who am I? She sees her and Marcus's clothes in a trail on the floor and bites her lip, remembering last night. What is this? This is the address of the Burlesque Lounge. Marcus shrugs, dries his hair. You can't tear down the club. But what about the history? That place is a landmark. Does Tess know about this? What makes you think she would ever sell the Lounge? But that club is her life! Not personal? It's pretty god damn personal for Tess! And Coco and Sean and Alexis. And what about Jesse? And Dave the lighting guy? And what about me? It's pretty God damn personal to me. She turns to leave. To the club. Where I work. She marches out of the room, resolute-- Tess! I have to talk to you! Tess keeps walking. Marcus Gerber is trying to buy the lounge, and he's gonna tear it down and build a twenty-story skyscraper! Tess stops. Slowly turns and stares at Ali, who's suddenly embarrassed to admit... I just saw the plans. Tess looks at Ali. Stunned. Ali stands there, breathless, waiting for her reaction. But Tess just turns, continues up to her office, and shuts the door. Ali turns to Sean-- then starts after her-- She has to do something! She can't just let him -- So that's it? It's over? But she can't just give up! Where'd you get this? Where's he going? To be with Natalie? I don't have a -- Sean tosses her his CAR KEYS. But I have to speak to him! Sean told me you're going to New York. Please don't go! Really? Yes! Yes. Absolutely. .Marcus who? They share a smile, separated by the ropes. Five weeks?! That's forever! Well, go get 'em, Jack. He smiles, then disappears into the crowd. Ali stands there, watching him, gobsmacked by the kiss. Tess! But this is really, really -- Tess holds up a hand. Yes now! God damn, you are one stubborn mule of a woman. Anyone else in their right mind would have figured out by now, when I have something to tell you, you listen! I told you I could dance, did you listen? No. Big mistake. I told you I could sing, did you listen? No. Big. mistake. This time you are going to hear what I have to say if I have to tie you up with your corset strings and scream it in your God damn ear. For the first time someone silences Tess. Ali takes a breath. Have you ever heard of air rights? Ten stories would. Twenty would decimate them. Leaving behind a lot of angry homeowners staring across the street at fluorescent light bulbs and dirty windows. Trying to sell-- How'd that feel? And to think, you didn't even want me around. .What was it you said to me that first night? ""Twenty bucks at the door will make all your dreams come true."" That was sweet of you.  Kinda ironic, when you think about it. I started off begging you to make my dreams come true, and here we are -- Just like that? Really? I never had a sister."
crash,JAMES ,James Spader," Of course. Be there in a minute. Where were you? Did you come? We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set... I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen. Thank you. They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air-crash victims. The beds are kept waiting. I'll listen for you buzzing over.  Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it. That's going well, then. And her husband? What was he? Where's the car? What!? They brought the car here? Have you seen it? It's about time. After being bombarded endlessly by road-safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in an actual accident. Yes? Yes. Dr. Remington...? You should have gone to the funeral. What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet? I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant. Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident. I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine. You're not envious? No. There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it? You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love. I can drive. I'm not thinking about the crash at all. It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people... You'll tear your gloves. I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult. Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again. You haven't told me where we're going. The airport? Why? Are you leaving? I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them. So -- why the airport?  Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it. Are we imagining it? The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes? Isn't that rather too close...? What is it? Really? What kind of exhibition is it? You're kidding. You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together. It's strange -- I thought all this would be far more popular. Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him? Oh, yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash. Is that part of the act or are they really hurt? Why are the police taking this all so seriously? Do you live here? With Seagrave? What kind of help can I possibly be to you? You seem to be everywhere at once as it is. What exactly is your project, Vaughan? A book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic? Vaughan, what the hell are you doing? Are you trying to create your own Famous Crash? It does. He's very pale. Covered with scars. No. But when he's in that car... I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident. Please finish your story. And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars? And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents? You could get your wish at any moment. Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car crash? It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why. What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project. Hard to say. No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan. Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians. At home. I couldn't face all this traffic. We must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Hello? Ballard.  Where are you? Where do you think that one should go? I thought that was you, up there. What? Tell me. One of your suitors? It's Vaughan. He's courting you. Let's go find him. The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away. Not yet. It's only beginning. Vera! Vera Seagrave! Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I'm trying to find Vaughan. I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport. I'd like to register a claim for the black 1963 Lincoln, the one that came in a couple of days ago. Is there a form I can fill out? A close friend owned it. Catherine. Are you all right? Are you hurt? Maybe the next one, darling... Maybe the next one..."
surrogates,GREER ,Bruce Willis," Where'.s the sport in that? You have the right to remain silent-- But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash, manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greer's eyes. Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away, running from between buildings across a street-- WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still alive. He tries to get up, but-- GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes, points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head. Stay with me asshole--  Nah, go back to work. GREER rises as his PHONE CHIMES, he touches his earpiece. IN BG, the DRIVER pulls away. He's a rental. He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY, oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck. We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated synthetic humans . These are not artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away. Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and receiving impulses, they are completely inert. Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND. --trash pick-up on Maple and 4th. Any ID from the rental agency? You think? Or something happened to the operator. GREER and PETERS stand over the corpse, a UNIFORM stands nearby. Greer holds his SCANNER near her head. Registered to a Cameron Michaels, out in Clarksburg... Optics are damaged. A tux? Kind of over-dressed for a jacker joint. GREER pulls out his scanner. BY TUXEDO's FACE, the SCANNER reads ""NO SIGNAL."" GREER seems surprised. PETERS looks over his shoulder. Little too pretty for that. GREER lifts one of Tuxedo's eyelids-- CLOSE, shattered GLASS, ELECTRONICS visible within. He's synth all right. So much for the identity chip. Clarksburg's just up the 270, let's talk to our witness. Got something better to do? Welcome back. The Human Coalition isn't ""the enemy."" ""Dreads..."" Sounds like they're doing a bang-up job out there. Why'd you transfer? Till he retired. Had no idea he was that old. Nothing to worry about. Who does? Hello? A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech CHAIR. The two feds move quickly to see-- --CAMERON MICHAELS, a 40-ish, overweight, bald male in his underwear. BLOOD runs from his nose, his face twitches slightly; he lies in a STIM CHAIR. Call the paramedics. While Peters calls in BG, GREER moves to the PROJECTOR'S MONITOR SCREEN and taps a touchpad. ON SCREEN - STATIC. GREER REWINDS to POVs at the hard- core CLUB. FAST FORWARD to the ALLEY, making out with TUXEDO. This is a recording of recent experience, as seen through the eyes of the BLONDE. GREER switches to real-time. Tuxedo breaks the kiss and turns to look OS. Not cool. The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE. The Dread scowls, zips up and moves away from Greer, plunks down at the end of the car. Greer pockets his badge calmly. It's OK. Come in-- Put him up. I was about to get some sleep. Maggie enters the kitchen, not looking directly at Greer. She puts some bread in a toaster, prepares coffee. Some poor cross-sexual had an aneurysm while he was online, had to get him to a hospital. Maggie winces, disturbed by her husband's job. She flips on a small flatscreen TV, volume low. NEWS and WEATHER. Bedsores? Want me to take a look? Well, there's room on the credit card. No, I just meant-- But that's our surrogates. It's not the same... I was thinking more like a vacation. An island somewhere. I mean a real vacation-- just us. Leave our synth units home. Tuxedo's operator turned up, student at Yale name of Anthony Canter... They're uploading his memory file. Seems we're dealing with an actual homicide. PETERS, at the other  desk, leans in to look over Greer's shoulder while the file uploads. Well, you get a little tired of property crime, vandalism-- What are you, quoting VSI? Yeah, yeah. Fact is, most of the people you refer to as Dreads are just too poor to afford a synth. You think they like living on reservations? Poor kid. Pathologist said his brains looked like soup. Two people in a narrow alley, surrounded by fire escapes, cell towers...? Is he the perp, or just some lookie-loo--? What you got? You still thinking lightning? is this necessary? Kid liked the wild side, huh. Did his father know? Armando doesn't answer, this is getting too personal. Canter must get a piece of every surrogate they sell. CANTER emerges from a study. His face is young, but there's some grey at his temples. Otherwise, he looks identical to the dead TUXEDO. GREER takes this in. Dr. Canter? I can't help noticing, your surrogate-- it's very similar to the unit your son was using... Canter pauses, then moves to a DOOR and opens it.- LIGHTS INSIDE FLICKER ON, revealing-- --a WALK-IN CLOSET with a half-dozen CHARGING BAYS. Four surrogates here, all versions of the man we've just seen-- Canter at different stages of life, from youth to almost elderly. Two of the charging bays are empty. Dr. Canter-- we don't know of any way to kill an operator remotely. Do you? Guess the interview's over. Not really. You got kids? Lot of that going around. He starts to place the card on the desk before the immobile Canter. Armando steps forward warily-- Greer shows him the card before putting it down. If he thinks of anything else. Someone targeted Canter's surrie, got the wrong operator. They get to their car, parked in a RED ZONE. GREER curls his lip at a METER MAID-- a DRONE SURROGATE ON WHEELS, NO EARS, as it rolls calmly away from his car. I'm sure the guy's got enemies he never even heard of. Damn. Why didn't I think of that? The two of them move on to an ELEVATOR BANK. Just advertising the product.  Ugh. Right, I keep forgetting that. Our immediate superior. Mm. Any idea what could cause a surrogate's head to explode from the inside? On the table, in a plastic EVIDENCE BAG, is a fried CIRCUIT-BOARD along with a pair of SHATTERED EYEBALLS. Greer passes this to Welch, who barely looks at it. Not much. He's dead. No one's talking lawsuit. we'd just like to know, is there any precedent for an operator being killed by signals from his synth unit? There is one more thing. The victim was Anthony Canter. The son of one of your company's founders. GREER studies them as they process this news. Kind of a strange coincidence. Mr. Waters? Seth Waters? GREER checks the man's ID BADGE-- a PHOTO of a pudgy, bearded white man with glasses, the name SETH WATERS. Suddenly, WATERS snaps out of it, looks down at the two agents. Despite his appearance, his manner is nerdy. We're with the FBI. He studies the BADGES they hold out. May we take a look? Brand new camos, no mud, no dirt... this thing's never seen combat. Name and unit insignia removed... let me check out the motherboard. So no such thing exists? Not when his lips are moving. Greer shakes his head as they both get in the car. WITH BRANDON - Out of earshot of the feds, he speaks into a small earpiece. Sir, we are not at liberty to comment on an ongoing investigation. You handled that well. The freak who was working the door at the club. Got a look at our perp dead-on. ON SCREEN - The Assassin's features HIGHLIGHT, the words Eighty-seven percent match. Close enough for government work. GREER and PETERS quickly scan the man's rapsheet. And they let him off? Ever come down here? It's like being inside God's head... The DOOR UNLOCKS and they enter-- They've been trying to puppet Bobby for years-- Ten minutes ago? Where?  Getting a chopper. Peters takes this in, calls after him: We're close! Noise suppression! LOPEZ nods, hits a couple of switches. THE LOUD THROB becomes a barely audible WHIRR. We hear PETERS' VOICE over the radio: Ignore her, Lopez. Get us as close as you can. LOPEZ grins--and pushes the stick hard-- Jesus, what is that? STRICKLAND is on the run again, scaling the fence. He hasn't spotted the chopper. GREER looks in the direction he's heading-- A HUGE CHAIN-LINK FENCE, topped with barbed wire, stretching across the whole city, just a hundred yards away. PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the radio), long-haired and bearded, adorn the fence. There's a GATE, with two GUARDS checking those entering, one or two people are waiting. He gets through the gate, we can't touch him. GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER DART into the chamber. LOPEZ maneuvers to give Greer an angle out the chopper's side. Pull up, Lopez, pull up! You're a killer-- Strickland! Wait! I'm a federal agent-- Maggie! Wake up! He's clearly in pain, clutches his temples. BLOOD begins to gush from his nose. Greer slides down against the door, unable to stand. Please, I need your help... open the door! CAMERA MOVES through the RED-LIT room, to show the WIRES of a SENSORY PROJECTOR, a partial view of MAGGIE'S HEAD. Would you do that? Get a surrogate for our kid. Our hypothetical kid. It just seems weird to me. Who's there.-  I thought you might've been telling another joke. Peters seems relieved. Maggie waits for an introduction, but Greer seems withdrawn, shy-- Peters has never seen his physical body. Except older and fatter. Sorry if I seem a little out of it. They're calling it a concussion-- felt like my head was going to explode. With a brisk RAP on the doorframe, STONE enters. You tell me. How's Lopez? Stone sighs, looking him over. Quietly: None of us did! We still don't know. I don't think Strickland even knew-- he thought he was just taking down ""the abominations."" I've been going through my memory files of the crash... ever seen anything like this before? ON SCREEN - a magnified CLOSE-UP of the DEVICE in STRICKLAND'S HAND, as he points it upward at the helicopter. We need to get this guy.  They said the end of the week-- What about my surrogate? I haven't been out without a surrogate in a long time... They wanted to give me something for the anxiety... they call it corporeaphobia. Jesus Christ. I like to see my own face when I look in the mirror. Hello. Testing-one-two-three... THE SALESMAN works the computer, GREER lies in an uncomfortable STIM CHAIR attached to a_SENSORY PROJECTOR, RED GOGGLES over his eyes and a CAMERA pointed at his face. He seems uneasy. PETERS looks on from nearby. No. I'm a grown man for Chrissake, I should be able to walk down the street without completely freaking out.  Here's to self-medication. He takes a sip and spits it out. The BARTENDER turns. What is this? The BARTENDER gives him a once-over. You have any real booze? You know, they really don't look human. You can't tell when you're inside them, but... GREER turns to PETERS, studies her like the others. But I'm not really looking at you. I'd like that. PETERS blinks, Greer has suddenly gotten sincere on her. He looks away. You know, when we started working together, I thought you were kind of a stiff. It's more than that... you're different. Or maybe I am. Greer's embarrassed, shrugs it off. He puts down a bill and rises. You probably oughta head back to the office. I'll be OK. He moves toward the door, she tags along. I'm thinking you should double- check Strickland's records, go back to the hard copies. See if you can find out why they dropped charges. It's like riding a bike. It's a lovely day. Thought I'd take a trip to East Baltimore. He pauses at the top, a hit of vertigo. Was it always this steep? Since I'm stuck in my skin, I oughta take advantage of it. Hell, as long as Strickland has that device-- I'm safer this way. He clutches the handrail, starts moving down. I'm sure. Just a little carsick. The TAXI pulls away, Greer heads for the GATE. Where would I find the, the what do you call it, the Temple? Thanks.  Catch a lotta surries tryin' to sneak in, do ya? Excuse me. Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to know a Jack Strickland? I'm told he worked here off and on. What happened to Jack Strickland? I'd like a word with the Prophet. Strickland was carrying a weapon. If it isn't recovered, there could be serious consequences-- for all of you. IN BG, the PROPHET and HANDLERS head toward a large RV. Needs repairs. Frisk me if you want. I'm starting to see your point. AT THE GATE - GREER leaves, trying to muster as much dignity as he can. The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically after him. I'm not a Dread. Who are you? Canter? You're having me followed. I suppose you deserve that. Why not? You stand for everything the humanists hate-- He'd outlived his usefulness. With me all over his ass, he was becoming a security risk-- Presumably. So now you're the victim of a government conspiracy? You really don't need to do my job for me. Boy/Canter takes in Greer's disheveled state. Obviously. You know I don't like you jacking in the house. He finds an untouched, dusty bottle of SCOTCH, sniffs it and pours a drink. Maggie looks him over. Just finding out how the other half lives. So what's his name? Alive. Is that what they are out there? She shakes her head and returns to the living room. Excuse me. Brian turns, starts to rise. Greer grabs the man and HURLS him backwards onto the GLASS COFFEE TABLE which SHATTERS. The other three back away. After a stunned moment, Brian starts LAUGHING, very hard-- obviously, he hasn't felt a thing. Guess the party's over. MAGGIE follows GREER to the door. They speak in hushed Does everything have to have a point? GREER takes a breath, bows his head. I'm sorry. I just want us to-- to connect again. To have a family, to have a life.  We can't do it through this wall of plastic. MAGGIE pulls away, his BLOODY HANDS have left marks on her blouse. In the flesh. He takes in the damage to the lobby, the police tape, the attacker's chalk silhouette. Saw it on TV. Mm. Just cleaning out my desk. Nice of you to notice. You remember where the rest rooms are? Hope I didn't wake you. You tell anyone I was going out to the rez? Canter, for example? Not half as bad as I feel. Greer refills his coffee cup with Scotch, holds the bottle out to her questioningly. Come on. Just pretend to get drunk with me. Peters shakes her head with a smile. Greer shrugs, takes a long drink, sighs and rubs his sore neck. Feel like I've been asleep for years-- now I wake up an old man. Rip Van Frigging Winkle... Peters moves behind him, begins rubbing his shoulders, a massage. What are you doing? I'm not sure how kosher this is... Does feel good... better than a stim chair. He allows himself to enjoy it for a moment, bows his head. You ever feel like it's... over? Us. People. The stuff that used to make the world make sense. That made us... human. I don't know, morality, love. Whatever. What lives? A beat, GREER sits up and pulls away from her touch. He holds up a hand and lets it fall. This has become obsolete. Someday soon, we'll all just be brains in jars.  You can't unring a bell.  Thought you were the one all into the brave new world. PETERS is staring at her own plastic hand. She looks up at Greer, changes the subject. So the Prophet has him killed. And we have to assume he now has the power to kill anyone he wants... It's from my memory. Damn thing put me in the hospital. Killed a couple of cops as well. We believe this weapon-- the one that doesn't exist-- is in the hands of the Human Coalition. Brandon is finally losing his composure. I was hoping you'd tell me. BRANDON looks conflicted, finally opens up. Not this one. Maybe it never got to you guys in the first place. Who makes them? You win the battle with one shot. So it's an assassination tool. Worked late. I'd really like to sit down and talk with you. No, Maggie, face to face. The two of us, for real. BRIDGET is getting uncomfortable. Honey, if you're worried about the way you look-- it doesn't matter, it never did-- I married a person, you're choosing to be a thing. And I'm so sick of being surrounded by things-- young, beautiful things. Because it's bullshit. Because we're human, like it or not. I may just have to kick down your bedroom door. Then maybe I should just move out. Just checking e-mail. Don't be ridiculous.  This stuff is awful. He'scalling up a new file-- ON SCREEN - the name ""LIONEL CANTER"" followed by the words ""CLASSIFIED - SCAN REQUIRED."" A moment later, we see GREER'S IMAGE, a LIGHT FLICKERS from the webcam on the MONITOR FRAME. Then the words ""UNAUTHORIZED USER."" What do you suppose VSI has against Canter?  He dies, they still have to pay his estate. There was a middleman. As he moves for the door, he points at her paperwork. To authorize informant payments, agent in charge has to initial... As he exits, Peters looks back down at the documents. The scrawled initials ""AOS"" on an INVOICE. Just cleaning out my desk. A moment later, STONE pokes his head out. Just about done, sir. Greer starts to move away, turns back. I almost forgot. Victor Welch sends his regards. Stone shakes his head, feigning incomprehension: Guy at VSI. You looking forward to moving to the private sector--? Nakata is listening curiously. Stone angrily gestures for Greer to come into his office, he doesn't want to have this conversation in public. Greer keeps speaking as he heads inside. Will you finish out the year? We're sure gonna miss you around here... STONE SLAMS the door. I know it's hard to resist, better hours, better pay--  No. I was just fishing. Two cops died. You knew he had the --because you gave it to him. VSI makes them-- they hand one to you-- and you chose the trigger man. Your own little black op. If anyone looks, they blame the Dreads. But Strickland didn't follow the plan, did he? He didn't give you back the 0. D. like he was supposed to. Not quite. What I can't figure out is why. Why kill Canter? STONE stares at Greer, angry and defiant. He moves to his desk, types into his COMPUTER. Greer approaches slowly. Just meet me in the garage-- leave the trunk open! As he rounds a corner, he comes face to face with-- --a pair of AGENTS, each carrying a HANDGUN. They approach from below. Ever hear of the Human Defense League? According to this, their number one supporter is Lionel Canter. Says he's funneled billions into their organization. Not to mention direct support for the man who calls himself the Prophet. Canter's bought him land, lawyers... and enough weapons to start a war. Not enough for a courtroom. But VSI knew that if Lionel Canter suffered a mysterious brain hemmorhage, the powers that be wouldn't be terribly upset. I had no idea you were such a humanist. PETERS looks away-- then reacts to something on TV, grabs a remote and turns UP THE VOLUME. ON TV SCREEN - HAND-HELD footage as NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS move across the Dread Reservation No Man's Land, using TASER WANDS to subdue resisting DREADS, frisking them and rifling through possessions as they upend dwellings. Colonel Brandon didn't waste any time. The what? Overload Device. She nods and turns nonchalantly back to the paperwork. As she does so, GREER cocks his head and studies her. Protecting Brand's confidence, he never told her what the device was called. I call and tell him I'll take early retirement with full pension benefits. In return for keeping his little secret. I'm not laughing. Can't bring him back.  Maybe he's got it coming. I'm only gonna be there a couple hours. She leads him toward a curtained BOOTH, one of many here. RED GLOWS emanate from a few. Generic's fine. She pulls back a CURTAIN to reveal a STIM-CHAIR and a Who's on duty in surveillance--? Sanders, great, put me through-- He's pursued by the RENTAL AGENT. It's an emergency, you need to connect me now! Bobby, it's Greer, I need a remote shutdown. You'll have the surrie's digital address on file, Agent Jennifer Peters. CAMERA MOVES to reveal that PETERS  is holding BOBBY at GUNPOINT, a grim expression on her face. She doesn't realize Bobby's on the phone. Hello? Bobby, are you there? Bobby looks toward the special TERMINAL that displays the surrie serial numbers. NUMBERS are cranking through fast, ALL HIGHLIGHTING. Bobby looks at Peters, but speaks for Greer's benefit. Maggie, please pick up-- damn it, you have to disconnect as soon as you get this message-- get off line, abandon your surrogate! You're in danger, everyone is-- I wouldn't be. I'm here to arrest him. ARMANDO moves closer at this. Listen to me. Dr. Canter is committing a crime via surrogate-- right now. If you don't cooperate and let me up there, you become an accomplice. Ow! Easy, I'm only human. As Armando relaxes his grip a bit, GREER flexes his left arm-- then gasps and clutches his chest, as if having a coronary. He stumbles, falls to his knees. Armando bends over him-- The elevator key! Damn it! He moves to a NARROWER STAIRCASE with a sign, ""ROOF You're insane. She's dead. You bastard, she was my partner, I cared about her-- Shut up! Greer clenches his fist, if the man wasn't in a wheelchair he would beat the hell out of him. Struggling to control himself, mind reeling: How many people are you? You're really the Prophet? Why...? You created them. What's going to happen? No--! Before Greer can stop him, CANTER BITES INTO IT and swallows. Greer tries to get the capsule from Canter's mouth-- but the man is DEAD within moments. Maggie--? He KNOCKS gently, then tries the door-- it isn't locked. Maggie, it's me. She pulls away from his touch at first, struggles. It's OK, it's OK... Ssh. It's just us now. Slowly, she puts her arms around him, weeping against his chest. PULL BACK and--"
smashed,KATE,Mary Elizabeth Winstead," Bullshit. If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say? That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it.  Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen. She's hot! What can't you tell? You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her.  I'll take point -- follow me. I want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week. Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him? He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court...that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *  And she dumped him.  And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so cute!  I think I got him laid. She seems totally game. I think I'm done for the night. No -- he needs to keep working it!         * You guys stay here. I'll be home when you get there. We can ""you know"" then. So's Owen.  I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive -- it sobers me up.  I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women. No, it's just one.  GoodbyeIloveyouboth! You okay?  Um...sure. Oh... I guess I could... I was gonna say ""call you a cab,"" `cause, you know -- I don't even know you. I wasn't -- It's, uh...whiskey. I don't know. No.  Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you just roll down the window?  WHOA! Not what I thought you meant. No, I...is that pot? Oh, shit! No...no thank you. I don't, um...I've never smoked crack. Uh...I think you should go. I don't know -- people might offer you crack? I said no. One puff. Then we are both going home. Fine.  ...'cause I feel like I understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? I mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: ""There's some upper-middle-class, NPR listening, self-congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. Probably never had to worry about anything."" But that's not true at all! I grew up poor, man. Single mother. McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers -- that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us -- and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week. I was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest. Eating used to be my thing. When I started drinking, though, I kinda stopped eating so much.  But anyway, the point is: You and me, we're not so different. Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep. It's a long story. I ended up... I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive. Charlie --  -- I'm fine. I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work. Don't worry so much. I'm fine.  C'mon -- let me get you to bed. Thanks, baby. Why does the coffee taste so much better when you make it?  Now, if I add a ""C,"" what word do I have? Yes, Hillary?                                         * That's correct! Can. You've won an all-expenses paid trip to the blackboard, Hillary!                                  * C'mon...there's a washer-dryer combo in it for you. Great job, Hillary -- let's give                      * her a round of applause! Can anyone use ""can"" in a sentence? Yes?  Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro with flames painted on the hood. Now --  -- what's another word I could make by adding a letter to ""an""? C'mon... Yes -- Ramon? P...okay, what word would that make if I added a ""P""? Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN! Wow! Just look at that excellent penman --  I'm so sorry you had to see that. What? Yes. Oh, that's really good to know. I'll have to thank him.  I just feel awful for getting sick in front of my students. Um...it's the first trimester.  Uh-huh. Okay. Huh?  Well...it's hard to explain. I wouldn't call it a burden, but -- Yeah. Exactly. Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps a lot. Like...a lot.  Thank you. Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better. And I just wanted to say thank you.  Oh, no, I... I know that! Oh, God, I...  ...listen -- I'm not actually pregnant. I'm just really hung over. The kids started asking me questions after I vomited and I panicked. I know. I...please don't say anything. I had such a crappy morning. I told my class I was pregnant. I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry. Well, it was a lie. I just lied to my class. After barfing in front of them. Yeah, that's what they said.  Listen...I can't do this anymore. I dunno. I think I might...drink too much. I know I do -- I'm a fucking mess... I left work after puking in front           * of little kids. And...now I'm               * drinking in the middle of the day.          * Isn't that like a slogan for some kind of beer or toothpaste or something...? Yeah...  ...I think I need to slow down.  And I might need help. I know, but...I might need more help. I don't know -- I just get stupid when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a lot. Yeah, well...  ...you've gotta promise not to tell this to anyone. That includes Owen. Well, last night I kinda, um...  ...smoked some crack. After I left the bar, I, uh, picked up this drunk girl and...I don't really remember what came next, but I ended up smoking crack with her. Well...she seemed desperate. She really needed a ride home. Downtown. I think she maybe lives in...a tent? Well...she might be homeless. Or a prostitute. Or just some lost sorority girl.  To be honest, I'm not sure... The drinking led to the crack- smoking. The drinking leads to everything stupid I do.  I mean...can you even remember the last time we had sober sex? Yeah, right.  Holy shit! And we answered ""yes"" to like every question and at the end it was like, ""If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!"" What crack? Absolutely. Envy isn't exactly the right word... Yeah, but who doesn't? No! We're great. I'm gonna go! No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it? See ya.  This is me: going. So? You should come too! Oh, yeah? Watch me! Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate! A what?  Okay.  Do I just sit wherever? To this? Yeah. Why's everyone whispering? I guess. I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a little drunk right now. Do you want me to talk about my childhood or something?  I can -- I kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him. And my mom...oh, man...I don't even know where to start. She's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead. Her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and --  I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything...  How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars?  How old are you, Amber? Everyday? AMEN!  Okay...I think I'm good. So much for that. No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE! I don't have to drink.  I just really like to drink.                            * What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come on -- I'm in here all the time. You know me. C'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two... It's just a little wine. I'm not driving or anything. Come on, dude -- I'll let you have a sip if you want. Why don't you give it to me, then? That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift -- because we're friends.  You distract him, okay?! Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick? Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! This is bullshit!  I have to pee.  I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad.                         *  C'mon...can't we drink together? Charlie!  Not again. I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late. I have a weak bladder. You work from our kitchen. Huh? Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone? You must've been dreaming. I... I don't know yet. Not until summertime. You guys will be on vacation. Maybe...Woodrow Wilson? Thanks again for covering for me. There won't be another time.  Okay...  ...David? I don't know.  Um...no? I puked in front of my class and then told everyone I'm pregnant. That's not really okay, huh? I went to AA last night. It was awful. I kept getting shushed.  You? Maybe that would be good...I don't know.  Thanks. Oh, well...she and I aren't that close. Okay. (takes a sip of orange juice) And...you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- who knows I'm pregnant. Could you...? Hey... How was your day? And what's that smell?  Charlie! You need to eat. Oh, that sounds fun, but... I don't know...this guy I work with -- Mr. Davies -- Yeah -- turns out he's sober and invited me to a meeting. What? Well...this is a smaller meeting. It might be different. I dunno -- I think I want to give it a fair shot. Besides -- I was hammered last night.  Go on and have fun out drinking with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm just gonna, you know, try something         * different... Does everybody just...kinda, you know -- talk here? So since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor?  I can't believe I'm really here. I kinda like her. I feel like you're my wingman. Hey, I liked your speech. Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted. I don't really know how this stuff works. But...could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but... Okay. Yeah.  You've been sober since you were 24? That seems really young. Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and...  ...I'm an alcoholic? Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words...  ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink -- a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed.  It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary.  I'm kinda...scared. I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic. I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days.  The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week. It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay. But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly I have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem. Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom...  A year, at least. Maybe.  And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives.  We haven't slept together in forever...  I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good. I could stick around and help you... I didn't know you were married. Why? Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that ""men stick with men, women stick with women"" stuff. Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me? Yeah, crush. It's okay. I think you're a really good guy. Oh, c'mon... WHAT THE FUCK? YES. Jesus -- you can't just go around telling people you want to fuck their ""moist pussy.""  Who even says that? I have to go inside my house -- where I live with my husband.  Thanks for your creepy version of honesty. You okay? Actually, I'm not really in the mood. It's okay -- the 90 days was the gift. It's alright. Charlie...  ...I miss you. I mean...I don't know. I don't really feel connected to you anymore. No.  We don't talk that much. Kinda drunk. There's some stuff I need to do this weekend. I think I'm gonna go up to Lake Arrowhead.  Do I need a reason? No.  We send her checks. But we never actually see her. Sometimes it feels like I'm paying her to not be in my life. I thought it would be nice to visit her.  And Jenny thinks it would be a good         * idea. What? No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or something?  Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This just...it felt like the right time.  With all the changes I'm going through. Um...I think I should go alone. Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but -- I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink.  Just while we're there.  I should've brought something. Something, you know? Flowers, or... No. Definitely not that.  Go on...  Oh, God... I left you a message, mom. Just water for me. That's pretty wild, mom. I told you I just wanted water. That's actually why I wanted to come up, mom.  I stopped drinking. I'm not pregnant, mom. I just needed a break. I'm sober for the first time in years. It's been a while, actually.  Drink if you want to, Charlie.  Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm doing it by myself.  And...I started going to 12-step meetings. I thought you'd be happy for me, mom. It's okay, mom. I know you can't help it. This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned. We came here every year the week before Christmas. And then I worked here in high school -- selling hot chocolate. And they had real reindeer, too. They kept `em over there. My mom worked here when she was younger. I think everyone who grew                  * up around here worked at Santa's Village at some point. This is what I think of when I think of Christmas.  Thanks for coming up here with me. I'm sorry my mom's so awful. Huh? Um...no.  Oh...you shouldn't have. Wow...  Oh, it's so...nice. Uh-huh...  What? What you said to me was really fucked up. What were you even thinking? I get that. But you can't force your ""honesty"" on everyone you know.  I'm flattered that you have...feelings for me. I am. But I'm married. No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever. Seriously. Consider that a rule of thumb.  Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say ""moist pussy"" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body! I'm not mad at him -- I'm mad at you! You said you wouldn't tell anyone about what I did. Great.  Why don't you guys just go to the bar now? I'm hanging here. I'm staying in. Bye. Yeah...  ...I love you too. Yes? What?  Well...""Shouldn't you be fatter?"" is the correct way to ask that question. Now, one day when you're very old and wise fourth graders, you'll learn about multiplication and -- Well, I... ...I'm not going to have a baby. See -- I was pregnant but, it wasn't my time, I suppose... WHAT? No -- of course not! No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But...  ...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant. No -- not because a doctor   murdered it.  It's called a miscarriage.   That means it wasn't my plan --   it's just what happened.  Does anyone want to ask me   any questions? Let's get back to subtraction -- or addition. Or both. Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant?  And the bad news?  That's all, huh?  Jenny.                                      * She's my sponsor.  So...what'd you do today, honey? I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage. That's not funny. Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby. Well, I feel like a piece of shit for lying. It's not nothing. I lied to little kids and to my boss because I can't take responsibility for my actions. I've been thinking about doing that, actually.  Yeah. I think I would feel better about myself. I could be like you -- I could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible. Having rich parents doesn't make you responsible. I think it's pretty much done the opposite. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I wouldn't care if we struggled with money. I've struggled with money my whole life.  I'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if I - - in some drunken stupor -- married a man who just wants to party and meet bands. I'm talking about you being a baby. A selfish baby. What? At least I'm not drunk all the time. You loved that person? Do you not love me now? Before I was a mess.  I'm finally getting my life together -- and you loved me more before? I feel so fucking weird right now -- Charlie doesn't love me like he used to and I've lied to my students multiple times.  I just don't feel...normal right now. Everything in life isn't connected to being an alcoholic. ""Steps""... I have the crying part covered. I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything. You sure that's okay? I'm...I'm really sorry. I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do. It won't. I promise that. Okay, I... ...I can't keep doing this. I feel awful. No. You don't understand.  I have to be honest with you. Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever pregnant. I lied -- to the class and to you -- because I was scared. I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is -- No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um...  ...it's alcoholism. I've been working on it. I'm one- hundred days sober. When that happened I'd been out drinking and was hung over and -- Yes. Well, a student asked if I was pregnant -- and ""yes"" just kind of fell out of my mouth. I know. I was sick. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I am. I've been wanting to tell you the truth because honesty has become really important to me. I'm in AA now and doing the steps and working with a sponsor and everything.  It's really hard. I mean, I think my husband might hate me, and -- I know.  Am I being fired? Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm doing the right things now. Principal Barnes -- Thank you. I told Principal Barnes about everything.  Huh?  Oh, God -- no. I told her that I'm an alcoholic. And that I lied. And she fired me. I've been going to AA and trying to be sober and this is what it got me.  Fired, for telling the truth. I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a fuck up. I'm just like my mom. I gotta go. Whiskey. Double. Can I have another one? Why? What about him? You're not kicking him out. Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA.  It didn't work. You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase. I go to AA and sober my husband and I start fighting and stop fucking -- and sober I get fired! Isn't that what's supposed to not happen? NO! I don't want a cab. I want --  -- drugs. Can you hook me up? C'mon...let's go out back and smoke some crack. You think I'm above smoking crack? `Cause I'm not. And are you really gonna tell me you're not a little attracted to me...? Just a teensy bit...? Well...you might want to consider investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm smart. And I'm... ...a good person.  NO! I'm not. I've got friends. They'll pick me up. I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams about me. Can't believe my luck. I just want to get drunk and a bartender won't let me.  Life is stupid. You hear me? Life is FUCKING STUPID! Davey-wavey...I called you. Why'd you bring her?  Parole officer. How `bout we drive to Mexico and party our asses off? My treat.  Sounds fucking stupendous, right?  Fuck off. I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job. We got any drinks? Don't be cute with me. You know what I mean. What gave that away? Come on, baby -- let's do some shots. I'm celebrating. What the fuck does it look like? Are you gonna be a little girl or are you gonna drink with me? Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun.  Well...here she is. Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now you won't drink with me? Well thanks for all the support when I was trying to be sober! Of course you didn't realize! You don't fucking care about me. I love you too. Love is the easy part. It's the rest of the shit that's hard. Take off your pants. I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck. No! I want you to fuck me! Be a man and fuck your wife! With me? With me?! What the fuck is wrong with me? I try hard and I get shit on! Fucked up family, fired from my job -- this marriage. Nothing's wrong with me! What's wrong with YOU?! What? What? What do I need? I can't drink because I'm crazy or something and I can't stay sober because of you! I can't be sober and be with you. You tell me.  Thanks. Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic. I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober.  Well...that is SO not true! I had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing...feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world. And I was adorable.  I'd piss my pants, but I was still cute. When I first tried getting sober, I figured that as long as I didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. But it didn't.  My marriage fell apart. I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet...  ...that isn't what I signed up for.  Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again ""the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off.""  I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true.  When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome. I wasn't happy being the ""good-time girl,"" though. And honestly, I wasn't very good at it.  My life is really different than it was a year ago. I live alone. I'm bored a lot more. I have a job that pays a lot less.  I'm thankful for the program -- for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me. There are people that used to be a part of my life that I miss -- a lot -- but...  ...I'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine. Um...yeah. Sometimes. Sometimes.  I've been sober for a year. Yeah. Yeah. A couple of days ago. Tuesday.  Charlie... No. I don't think it's a good idea. Charlie, please don't do this. I don't like shitty 80's music.  I like good 80's music. You look really thin. When did you last eat? Should we order something? I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing. Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them. I don't care if you drink a beer. Yeah. Whatever. I haven't played in over a year. I don't know. Innate talent? Um...stick to the game, okay? Charlie -- Stop it. You could've been killed. Riding your bike -- drunk. But is that really the point?  I worry about you. You should go for yourself, not to make me happy. I'm not moving back in. Listen, I should go. It's gonna get dark soon. I don't know..."
